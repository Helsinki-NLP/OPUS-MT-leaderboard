28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase house of a local shopping mall.
The brother of the sacrifice said that he could imagine no one would want to hurt him, "it finally got up with him again."
The bodyname found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court medical department reported in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations were running.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, reported to the ABS transmitter KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a cook in Boston, had completed his dream job six months ago as a cook at Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman of Son & Daughter said they were "shocked and destroyed over his death."
“We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him painfully,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and compassion are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, "the things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could imagine no one who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always cooking something, preparing us for dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who was swimming with the river.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unleavened diamond that shine brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD notification phone at number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in shoes
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has made this clear in an interview.
“I’m always wrapped in shells or get labeled out of the label that usually has little to do with me and the reality.”
“I myself don’t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.”
“Honorably, these things are more dirty to me.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers spending her time at home, forming a TV with locker dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.
“We don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” the Hollywood star said.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is a lonely mother of two sons.
The film will take place with us from August 25.
Golfer Longer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are visible.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer sought a slight variation with some colleagues with an exit on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their feast night, hunting at the fast galoppe home to the feeder trees.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” says Langer.
And so the rider career was over again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournaments - was again near horses.
He and his family led him over the installation of the ALRV, he didn’t even swing to a horse for photography purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid delivered the Golden Sports Pyramide to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
The awards don’t lack the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkruuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already given him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” says Langer, “because it is forgiven not only for sporting success but also for social commitment.”
For decades, it has promoted the growth.
He also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros just like that.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the double U.S. championship won on Saturday was included in the Hall of Fame of the German Sports.
The excellent features include the body athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the wetters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-chairer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springreiter Alwin Shockey Mole and Posthum.
Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company moved to Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer stayed away from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump’s Economic Policy in Compare: It’s all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing trade agreement TTP - that wants both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential candidates are unanimously involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a basic issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it in doubt rather small and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate the economy to death, he says.
He would be quite different, Trump said.
He will massively reverse regulations, and he makes himself strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton says that the state has certain tasks to carry out, has opportunities to open the defendants and needs money to do so.
That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both of them are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton have to be invested in that, they say.
The Democratic candidate has announced the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty flags of the Republicans.
Trump could still have internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and boost coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion is also expected to be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris Climate Agreement will be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program and claims: “A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
“It will be either China, Germany or America – I want it to be.”
However, not only in the field of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, does not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both the United States do not want to isolate from international trade – but just protect American jobs better.
They should also be paid better, Clinton says.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is unclear: once he says: the minimum wage must run, then he says he should not be changed.
However, the large discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relax the economy and the citizens to boost growth.
His critics expect him to make his budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton is standing, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say, "More taxes are not the solution either."
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women fleeing alone, almost for everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Everybody has a baby who is at least one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious in the room with big eyes.
His mother watched the table.
Until she realized she was observed.
She smiles shortly and kiss the kid.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the business leader of Condrobs, a bearer of social aid offers in Bavaria, and is dealing with women on escape, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich Women’s Aid.
Recently it was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - neither as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
“It’s not too much to say: every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape,” says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatening torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a bearer of hope," she said.
In women there are other reasons for escape: “Many steal themselves secretly because they don’t see another way out.”
In their homes, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsion, homicide, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's going on.
That's going on on the escape.
"For example, the screw requires sexual action for a bottle of water is not rare," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is wrong, says Bahr.
Also here, lonely women in refugee homes would often be regarded as low quality and, in the worst case, abused.
This leads to traumatization of about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the northern Munich.
“Some of the children are certainly not voluntary.”
Many women are so used to say nothing.
“Or they don’t trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big.”
Since they often don't know to help, more accommodation is needed only for them, asks Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
The question is whether they know about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer no.
For example, there is no such thing in the government’s accommodations.
Even in Schwabs, refugee women are not lodged separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.
In Upper Bay, Under- and Central France, there are floors or homes in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be lodged separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says, "It is very important that men and women are hosted separately."
“If the privacy is missing or men and women are inhabited together, violence against women can become more and more persistent.”
Especially the laundry should be separately and easily accessible to women, the study says.
How much women feel this protection need, you can afford to see the andrang there is at the house in Munich.
“Since we have talked about it, we have a long waiting list,” says Bahr.
You can easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: Requirements for new workfighting measures
Deputy representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their trade unions to approve new workfighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested its entire council to approve more work combat measures from early September.
The JDC stated that the minister had failed to take into account the concerns about the contract.
Assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.
He was rejected by 58 percent of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government would remain "permanently quiet" to problems, resulting in the rejecting of the treaty.
"In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today has filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour combat measures starting early September.
The disputes led to the fact that assistants disputed six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.
He notified members of the BMA during the meetings held by 54,000 assistants and medical students before the vote, that the treaty should be beneficial and be adopted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the treaty for doctors in England would be forced to be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of foreign owners?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot reject the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was a handwriting, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow and he barely radiated heat, even for his remaining circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “loving friend” Putin – according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have accepted himself as if something bad had never happened.
It seemed to me his enthusiasm rather to indicate the opposite.
But a radiant, sustainable cooling by Putin showed that Russia’s head had forgotten nothing.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the collapse of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was an enraged fire.
Putin said Ankara was accused of falling Russia in the back.
The offense was even bigger as it was committed by an alleged friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild vetraun if it is not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a strong, totally restricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks would be guilty of everything.
The most serious were the charges of chief officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has disputed this vehemently.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a weapon stop are clearly on hand.
Erdogan needs mostly all the friends he can get after he was defeated in a missing state strike last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shot him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have severely affected Turkey, particularly the prohibition of charter flights, which usually brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are restarted.
They count on a late-seasonal storm on the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti made it as follows: "Turists there long, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the west, because its response to the attempted overtake of power is considered a weak answer.
The ongoing grudge about the speed of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is urged to benefit from the cold mood and reduce Turkey’s relations with the West.
The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted state government.
This is a self-comprehension for Moscow that even has a deep fear of changing regimes.
The summit at this brilliant sea palace allowed Russia and Turkey, as one analyst once described, to represent the "alliance of foreign owners": two countries that are disrupted from the West and treated badly and now bonded.
However, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be meaningful that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even discussed the issue.
The President of Turkey avoided deliberately answering a question about its differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus about where a common name for Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey has dismissed the Russian fighterjet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak back to each other at least.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand is intended to be reduced to a back office role, according to the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan reported to the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has been distant since it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
At this time, brand strategies "RBS" have used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Winker Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to turn more national brands into focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the exchange notation, will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will be our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we will now become a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that its Six Nations sponsorship will no longer continue and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how we focus on making this a better bank for customers,” the CEO said.
It would have been very cynic three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs, not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori split champagne after a double at Newmarket, bringing him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on predilection trained by John Gosden on his local race track with his second night win a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am easy and very modest.
Dettori picks up the jubilee as he wins the victory on Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the barrier race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-time retired winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4.493 career winner
Frankie is one of the best jockey in the modern world and it is not surprising that he has reached this milestone that just a few have reached before him.
He has a style and is strong, but it is his tactical intelligence that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He has been a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic for fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament hockey!
Frankie has won a win in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the dependent shelter of the British flat racing for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had initially difficulties when he returned from his six-month-old blockage, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to crash his doubts and return to his best shape.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettori has once said he wants to continue in competitions until his 50th age.
Russia's Putin fires Staff Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his staff chief Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin has "ordered Ivanov's release of his duties as president of the Russian presidential administration without any reasoning".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's Deputy Representative since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated at the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website, it says (in Russian) that he was later the protocol chief and staff manager of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
I think that the government's main task is to support your activities as a Head of State regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov requested to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convinced?
This step has made Moscow secrets.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest acquaintances for a long time and worked as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As a staff leader, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the staff chief resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is there a consequence of a kind of power fight here?
No one knows that right now.
But the official assertion - that a man who once was praised as a potential president - wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - hit big sceptics.
In his comments to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation early 2012 to trust these very complicated posts - you could almost say - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the posts in December 2011.
He was formerly Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his Deputy Representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could be President of Russia after Putin’s second term since a third term had violated Putin’s constitution.
But these posts were taken by another nearby ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after hit producers
Gibson participated in a physical contest last month in the series set in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, producing the series, announced its cancellation in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his termination.
The set came to artistic differences and a difference in opinion.
I regret the incident,” he said in a statement.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series, followed by a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published later, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who had previously played at Sitcom Dharma & Greg has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart blood in the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but it will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew, and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelfth season is set on September 28.
Mystery about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish could be sandals that were scattered by a spring spring.
Mr. Bain, who lives approximately 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the speculation in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blades" that approaches the finishing of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 conveyor parts.
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, “This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epical measurement in this project with more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel, used solely for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge end is a small activity that requires extremely precise tolerance for passing.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge covers are in their place, and today the last section of the deck gets a concrete replacement for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the closure represents future high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road cable section and its connection to the north tower deck in the construction, we then had to close the remaining locks on the northern or land side.
This was achieved by drawing the northern transport bridge 700 mm south.
This was a massive and at the same time very weak activity.
Massively, as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at a rise of approximately 3%.
Heikel, as the tolerances to which the team is working were small - on each side they only amounted to a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything loved very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after they were thrown in front of Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely, while their boat moved on by their own power.
"We saw the boat turned around around them and imagined the worst," Moelfre's rescue station chief Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already climbed the boat beyond its reach until we have left the water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boje depending on no rescue site.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, “The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness injured and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop plate, it was released from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was climbed.
Someone has been waiting for these men today.
Heavily injured – man falls on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and injured him severely.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal stuff.
Instead, the alcoholic criminals cut off the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she arrived in the apartment, she entered her two times.
The 44-year-old was injured on his hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the criminal.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
This alarmed her sister afterwards.
The 45-year-olds, together with her husband, wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn’t force him to leave the apartment.
So she and her companion went out of her house.
On the street, they met the man's former companion.
When the two women resumed the apartment, the 50-year-old dropped his sister and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?
The SPD and Green believe that investors will be much more committed in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes a "residence of action" for the next Council meeting.
But the dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
So far a regulation is missing.
Christoph Bratmann, SPD Fraction President, said: “We agree with the Greens: Whoever wants to build in urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be represented as social apartments in the future.”
However, the cheap apartments can also be found in stock.
However, the big point of dispute in the Council is, as Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas, but as much as possible 20 percent of housing as social housing.”
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, as Bratmann said, “There is no agreement between the groups at the moment.”
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left wants to be hard for investors.
No matter what, Bratmann says, there is an exacerbation of the situation in the housing market.
If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
However, the program is not entirely available: for about 1260 new apartments, which should be built in any way.
But how do you compare the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?
Only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning spokesman Nicole Palm, the city should now buy outlined bonds.
In addition, it is necessary to consider bringing apartments back to the price binding.
This is possible in the West City.
The problem could be solved by a strike.
In the West City, the end of the year.
About 1800 apartments can be brought back there to the price binding for cheap apartments.
This is what the owners don’t want, the housing companies don’t want.
Because the number of social apartments in the West City is drastically increased again, one is separated from the target of the so-called mixture.
There is no longer a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts.
The Greens are expecting that there will be still movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, chairman of the group, says, "For a wide majority, the CDU must go into the boat."
They have focused on more buildings for single-family houses.
But that doesn’t mean that a compromise can’t be found yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that deserves
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but rather rather spending their leisure time stinging on screens has been laughed by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and lately on smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities in the outdoors do not exclude each other.
I, of course, refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were created first for video games in the 1990s (a later drawing series, game cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many pop culture phenomena declined interest before the game was published in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The market introduction in other countries was moved by the massive demand that overloaded the server.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players with their smartphones go out and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and can be "photographed" (over a screenshot on their phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the laughter and jumped to search for the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant rise in steps that the "average" person returns every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently the Washington Post reported that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of traced people who train 30 minutes every day, grew from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it only sees raw data to increase performance.
Many public health information campaigns that people want to bring to "take 30 minutes of time," "to come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" shoot on dumb ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look poor.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight loss, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to cause them here.
But the wonderful thing at Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are noise gambling destructors who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's that?
There was a breakthrough.
Although smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to sport as this game does.
The new will lose its rise and the use will be delayed over time.
However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activism, helping many people hunt to be more active, fit and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
It's hard on the bar.
Amazing on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now also the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American tournament climbed on Thursday to multi-competitive title and expanded the gap between itself and the rest of the world under the shadow of the Olympics.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the Silver Medal winner and "Final Five" team cameradin Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles turns on the hard bar during the women's single match final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-combat title and is the fifth in total, while she holds her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at this moment ended.
This success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport in the last three years, won 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that includes a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said she was "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of over-dimensional expectations.
Not with a handful of gold returning to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
The American women, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, have won gold and silver at the women's single competition final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles received the first medal on Tuesday, while on the celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as a call sign.
Although Biles was on their long way to the top, never planned the future, that is not true.
Some of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
That's not an accident.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a child, was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip in the gym in which Boorman was trained, became forced.
Since summer 2013, she has no longer lost a multi-competition, a winning series that will stop as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina easily led by two rotations, the image was ruined.
Hard bars and ground tournaments - in which Biles holds the world championship title - won.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the hard bar - and put another on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman softened her when they expected her final outcome - a pure formality - and tears flowed on the bright red, white and blue eyeliners when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last four years when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went in a deep brake to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old crew captain, called the American Grandma, had a predecessor.
After her soil exercise, she gave the audience kiss hands, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new significance:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder in music hearing in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first serial killing in Phoenix while listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked at an entry, the authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a hand gun while standing on the side of the driver of the car and then fled with another vehicle, it is read in the report.
Police reported that the three-time murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the pockets or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led the investigators to get a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
Overall, in Spanish residents, nine people were killed in nine attacks and two injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a CBS subsidiary, at the beginning of the month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died still on the ground.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup press half an hour before the three-time murder, and was estimated that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found pattern halls and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the motor space.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It'll Be Better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But like the least of his older spouses, Edmund has microcephalia, the result of a genetic disorder, which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't let myself go on it.
What's not right at all -- of course, you've agreed to it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutionalize him.
"My first answer to that was, 'I didn't know that people were still doing'," Picciuto said.
Edmund can run with a walk help.
Edmund couldn't sit or crash until his third age, and he still can't speak.
But he makes slow progress.
He can walk with support and bicycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund invented for "Bitte Sing Me Something".
"We will bring him a sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has invented some signs alone.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as mass or zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions can vary significantly.
It is still too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an unconscious future.
I constantly asked what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know it.
I haven’t been asking for a long time for the prediction because I don’t expect someone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the zikavirus.
It'll be better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rainfall, flood causes rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is counted over the entire Saturday with more rainfall.
Numerous rivers in Southeast Louisiana and south of Mississippi flood their coasts and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards reported that officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to help the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, reported that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoa municipality would have requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used through large parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall into rain in this area.
In South Alabama, a flooding warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach over the weekend record level.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the nearby Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these flow through the rivers only slowly into the Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9:00 p.m.
Rescue teams still hit people from the flood waters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son were among those who were rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, has risen strongly overnight.
He said he would have warned another child who lived nearby.
"We were awake and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my taille.
His wife, Hansford, said that in the 48 years in which she lived, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said he and his family would have all disabilities and he would be the only one to swim.
Hansford said that emergency aids would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in the monastery where they were stayed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "slowly spread" as there continued to be severe rainfall and that the authorities had argued about evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inch rain.
Krautmann said the soil has been significantly filled with rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities stated that severe rainfall and street floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lessons in five schools.
The CBS’s daughter WWL reported that a member of Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now flooded.
The head of the municipality Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that were inundated by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency facilities were built to host the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa municipality, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood, and sandbags were provided for the residents who hoped to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," Lacy Landrum said by the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy from Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses had been reported as flood on Thursday, but had not been reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, "closed by balls", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several shooting injuries, including in the leather, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He has passed a lot, his small body was broken by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was expected to be healed again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reported.
The other two victims weren’t in the car, and the police just figured out whether one of the injured men could be among the criminals.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a cross-fire between several fires.
Patronal greetings for storm guns that were traced back to various storm guns surpassed the plot.
It appears that this has clearly been in a ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walk, there were helmets.
This is how there appears to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved here,” police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the broadcaster.
There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.
There was no arrests and the police currently checked reports according to the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl was encountered by a knife on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine under the Women’s Olympic team at the tournament for more than one reason.
First, I have been there at any Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and Spanish female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female tournaments was an Afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and the Americas rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gym routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-competitive event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the tops of this sport, but this is not how tournaments around the country look.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all took the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
You are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team, and this is also last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality looks like tournament is a costly sport and tournament is mainly in private tournament clubs, which will be maintained by parents, which will come up for training, decoration, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families).
Most of these tournaments are in wealthy prefectures that can support the business.
In these associations, the tournaments get their entire training and this is a costly and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to provide the communities with innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie with a more realistic and easy-to-access training.
I founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winner.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as school and vocational success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by obtaining the Olympic team gold and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors voted in a election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract to be introduced and said that the NHS would be in a "German country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants will receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unprecedented times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Assistant Doctors Committee, announced yesterday night in a statement: "Assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will warm up the current employment crisis and will deny it to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is over.
The BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes by negotiations led the government to participate in opposition and sometimes in silence.
That happened from a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month about his door would always be opened.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, cancel the force and respond to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further workfighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April predicted a withdrawal of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide doctors with coverage on the strike post chain.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistants subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, urged the assistant physician to end the strike.
Mortimer said, “Labour combat measures are not only the few but already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients, nurses and their families only to worry, emergency and interruption.”
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and have responded positively to the health ministry and other ministries on the concerns about the leadership and the whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as transmission, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional period, training documents, mutual recognition of the curriculum, relationship health, B training leave and the gender-specific labour in education in May, education in May, and education in May.
The £2 per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities have recommended to give this more people for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and one-quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and stroke are caused by collections of fat-containing materials in the artery walls that form locations.
If the coating breaks out, it can cause a blood vessel, which stops the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
When the blood vessel is dissolved, it can flow through the blood flow and stop the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The NICE guide design, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a double daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a recurring heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through Ticagrelor’s provisional recommendation, we are delighted that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness Leaving Election fraud in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on launch of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is consciously ignored as a devastating government report today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally arrested police, electoral observers and council houses to ignore evidence of vote abuse due to "oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that it should be allowed for the police to set up interruption bands outside of election cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends voters to have a certificate with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only needs to name his name and address.
The report suggests not removable ink to the fingers of a person when they give their voting to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should have more protection, says Sir Eric.
He urges the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only intended to prevent election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in the eastern London.
Last year, a special election court decided that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be treated with corruption and illegal practices of his office after a Lithuania.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynic way" and that he had put his critics in silence with accusations of racism and Islamophobie.
Rahman has led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of a follow-up in which one person is chosen as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter choice - when the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including conducting evidence to prove the identity
In his report, "as evidence, pressure has been exercised on defensive members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elders, particularly communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh background.
"There was concern that... government institutions would have ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition of political activists to edit letter selection documents to stop "learners".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the immigration and social fraud from being used.
Consider options to ask voters for your certificate before the election.
Use not removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To conduct systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are elected.
A three-year limitation on requests for an automatic letter selection.
It prohibits political activists from editing full letter elections and turnovers of letter elections.
The police are entitled to establish shutdowns for election stations.
A law amendment which facilitates an allegation of anxiety in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Forbidden photography in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (except from Wales).
Intensive training to ensure that employees implement the rule that voters go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlets case no penalty was made.
"The Election Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his Deputy Representative to corrupt and illegal practices because of Lithuania," he said.
He was known guilty for a number of reasons – according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings –.
He also criticizes the inefficient "dependent controls" of the election registration departments of the council houses.
Sir Eric said, “The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the alarming and hidden spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threatened this good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's Radler double runners and other famous double runners of Olympic athletes in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come out of the edge of the French bike athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot this week, which has proven to be an impressive duplicate of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who has his own famous double runners - at least not if you can give the social media faith.
In honor of the Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flaming on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a similarity with Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. crew in the Ark Shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
In addition to Kate's double runway on the bike rail, many people on the internet suggested how a certain archboazer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. crew in the Ark Shooting, has caused an insurrection on Twitter after images on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the madness in social media and admitted that he had been able to hear from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
“I don’t see a great similarity myself, except face hairstyling,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good guy, so I think I'll take it as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will certainly be more focused this year: the outstanding similarity between British breeder Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with its large, expressive eyes is intended to be able to go through as a double ganger for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is the view that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eye browns and lips.
Russian silver meditator Yulia Efimova has more than just sunny skin and blond hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans to be similar to a "athlet version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user told her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the tournament Gabby Douglas, with her own beautiful, wide smile similar to Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that a Chinese swimmer "as a pig has died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis on the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the 4x200m freestyle swim season, the CBC live broadcast viewers on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "as myf went off" and during the race like "a pig died".
Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was disabled when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming season.
MacDonald, who was brought to the CBS commentary team to give more "color", could be heard saying: "This 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went down like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for it.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swims the second stage of the swim season 1:57,79 - 1,61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap to China.
Watchers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "as a pig died?"???
The idiot didn’t realize they were still on broadcast.”
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free style swimsuit for women as follows: "This 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard to talk to many
Twitter users didn’t stop when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, said live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on a swimming performance."
It was an unsuccessfully chosen formulation, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC apologised over 90 times to people who responded to Twitter’s comments
Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users complaining about MacDonald’s comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We apologised quickly to our audiences on broadcasting and our followers on social media last night.
To clarify one, Byron’s comments refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to them as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formula. Byron does what he said very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim season at the CBC Olympics," he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, there was no disrespect and I am so sorry.”
Buyer in Primark eagerly surprised about a woman who tries shameless underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers did not know where to look at when a woman went out of their clothes in the middle of a primark to try underwear.
In order to aggravate the situation, she mustered how she looked in it, pulled it out and put it back into the reel.
She went on and tried four pairs of underwear in a bouverie place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark Store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she put her back to the regal
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she re-inspired and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underwear out of the release, pulled out her own shoes and shoes and tried it.
"She didn't even try to find a little more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, shit like Oskar."
"Everyone was worried when she got out of the underwears that she obviously didn't like when she put them back in the regal."
She repeated the same with three other underwears before she finally decided that she didn’t like anything, she went back and out.
"She didn't seem to disturb that she observed someone - or think about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, said, "How reprobate to think that someone would take underwear home, who took care of another person and who were not washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "How I got together, employees have tried to pull out the clothes after she went - what is just as good."
“I would hate going home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman took her back and pulled her out again and didn’t wash them.”
A spokesman of Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9, in our Folkstone branches."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself with Krav Maga from gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a great master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers on nearby distance.
Whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spice for your robber.
If you get closer to you from behind, then you should turn around as the first so that you can see your attacker and "draw out of the shooting line," Mizrachi says.
Then catch the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him in the knees and turn around while the attacker crawls down from pain, the gun from his hands. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards while they target the gun on him.
When attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the gun and turn it around so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his hand before they move backwards and target the gun on him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does.
But remember that in a thief it's the most secure to give your money - unless you're not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright creates his language for a travel guide in the most dirty places in Europe
A British traveler underwent his immune system and turmoil reflex seriously – rejecting some of Europe’s dirtyest and eagerest places.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, moved his train on a Eurosignal, a rider at the Piccadilly Circus, a screw button of a train ticket and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before rejecting each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he would rely on.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to daylight.
The idea of removing the washing button of a train towel, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally abstract, but in fact, more bad bacteria are found in a kitchen washing.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left what he rejected more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by eating strange and wonderful things throughout the world.
From public landlords to railway stations to swivels of toilets, the task was to put his immune system under a sample
In the film, he said, “At the beginning of childhood, I was relatively worried about my health, and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms, and foam water.”
In the film, he was certainly fair for his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sampling frame showed a number of luminometers of over 4,000 units.
Compared to this, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to withdraw after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the film, he says, "It's close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to hide anything here because it's eager in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company conducts Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "Let me say this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I've ordered him to leak like the eager Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to make Ian attract them and others in which it was quite difficult.
I’m glad we’ve taken some of these dirty tasteries on the movie.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all the bacteria associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing the associated lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left her home after a delocalization with a £50,000 damage because she had terrorized her neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown down after a long list of complaints of her property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed climbing holes, wooden holes were lifted up, waste was spread on the floor and graffiti was stitched to the walls.
The family was resettled and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute dream for people here, and I believe that people don’t have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and her reputation is also.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment, and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball strikers, fears of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old waste was found
They were in the real estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden parts were swallowed
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the streets and they had to call the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing dismissed her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them a prolonged 11-week deadline to voluntarily withdraw.
The delocalization was refreshed by relieved neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They didn't laugh for anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“Tomorrow we couldn’t sleep.”
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not used to us!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said that it would have confused the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called regularly for 20 years.
On the overwhelmed side of the municipal house waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: “It is a shame that the tenant has deceived to take any responsibility for her behavior and the responsibility of her family, as a delocalisation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and her actions had to be terrified for her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who are boldly joined us and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbours comfort and the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging on the floor
Workers of the House Administration will now have to remove the Müllbergs that surround the House
In 2014, the police conducted a Razzia in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as waves, paraphernals and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she was accused of owned a class B drug in terms of trade.
She claimed that the money for a tomb of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were homeless, Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were shamed with graffiti.
Police say they will delogue renters who do not comply with the house order
Angela Crow from the police from Devon and Cornwall reported that the delocalization was a clear warning to the other tenant who did not comply with the house order.
"This applies to those who think they can behave without self-confidence and to those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-flying military jet overflowing beach
Sun officials in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft put an incredible strike flight
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when the frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-fliegend jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic videos showed how the military aircraft flyed nearly near the sun's officials on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they, understandably, began to worry about the noise of the drill drives, without first seeing what happened through the clouds on them.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said: "It flew twice very deep and there was a moment that it looked like it would fall down."
Nuno Arroja added: “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training plane to identify fishing boats before the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that the jet, due to its poor vision conditions, flew somewhat deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that security was not at any time threatened.
Fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese coastal country this summer, where four people died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong nebula and fire smoke - which restricted his vision.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boat as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with concern about Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona will fight for the first step towards the first title victory in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans join the duel around the Spanish Super Cup to the FC Sevilla, the back game rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must in the strengths of the underlying Cup finalist and the directed European League champion, among other things, resign Neymar, who disputes with Brazil the Olympic football tournament.
Also, Goalie Marc-Andre is missing.
The German suffers a belt ink on the knee during the training, which clarifies at least the insertion question at Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been playing the status number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique rejected a clear decision in this regard so far and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen for that in most other candidates.
Before the first compulsory game of the new game, there are doubts in Spanish championship about the team's fitness status, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game in Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the test game against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. still couldn't really convince them.
Sevilla, on its contrary, has digested the 2:3 retreat after prolongation in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and seeks the second triumph at the Supercopa de Espana.
Barcelona has achieved 11 successes of the record winner in this competition.
Ma Long in a League to Tischtennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5,4.4) in a single final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
Thus, the world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Tour Finals, and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have succeeded in the final game as expected and made the title of each other.
It was clear that for the third time a Chinese would get the single title in the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese at the top Olympics was the former SVS NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the sets and at Time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had withdrawn to the tribes and left their shields alone in fair competition.
“I have played the matches for my country until now.”
"In the final I play for myself," Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Ma really had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang down there only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expectant match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were sufficient breathtaking ball change.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-finals against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarusist had been injured, afterwards in medical treatment, had to "finally" enjoyed the leaf.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become similarly high at the table tennis age Olympia-Vierte.
Donald Trump raises “great problems” in the election struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is punished by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states, to punish its majority.
President Donald Trump has now approved weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-safe multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals inside his own Republican camp out of the race, the doubts of his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said before evangelical Christians he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He was guilty of false reports about his candidate, he resumed his well-known media records.
Republican Hochburgers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey survey from June, Trump and his competitor, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
Other institutions see Trump in advance, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also threatened.
In an interview with the broadcaster CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he would then stop Clinton's progress again: "As I did so far."
And jumped behind: "This will either be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation."
He does nothing else but “to tell the truth.”
If it’s not rich for him at the end for political correction, it’s okay,” Trump said.
Then I will return to a very good lifestyle.
According to press releases, the Trump party has threatened to delete funds to support his election campaign, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress would be stronger under the arms.
Olympia: Dreister fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee in the case.
Kenia's team athletes threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenia has sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee informed the establishment of a disciplinary committee to investigate the case immediately.
A Kenyan official had reported that former sprayer and today’s coach, John Anzrah, had issued a sample of urine under the name of the 800-meter driver Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic village.
This was reported by the doping controllers.
The World Association of IAAF has requested the IOC for information on the case to investigate its own, a spokesman of the IAAF said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will take an assessment," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, who gave the sample and signed," Kenias Chief Mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was owned by the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich became more than 800 meters in Beijing World Cup Four in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenya’s Leichtathletics Delegation Chief Michael Rotich was removed from the Rio Games.
He should have informed athletes of his country’s money payments about the upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping processes for a long time.
In the announcement of more than 2,000 doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio games, it was unusually mentioned before that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into consideration.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil, creating an anti-doping law and a functional control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.
As a consequence, WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose fight against doping is in line with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a great race nation.
The country's league athletes won most of the medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A series of TV reports from the ARD have repeatedly raised allegations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he employed them in Russian body athletics.
This could be proven that this sport was widespread and systematically baptized.
The Russian body athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love, similar to Romeo and Julia.
A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musician conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the music into the temple of the classic and fulfilled the role of Mary’s youth dream.
In the orchestra grave, Simon Bolívar orchestra led by Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swears.
We always say that it is very characterized in Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage, Bartoli plays an elderly Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
Maria’s role has always fascinated me.
First of all because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"She looks like me very much, my Italian character I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughed.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such a honour for us to work with her.
She is an unhealthy generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Directing is a need for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is hochaktual: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, when the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as expressive today as at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl joined IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria according to reports.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned a few weeks ago from her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the country's group's work, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-backed country and return to England.
“You can only hope that the only good thing in it is – as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone – people to stop making that decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London entered an airplane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was reported that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as candidate for the Supreme Court in case of an election winning at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The Senate's majority leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman of Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would appoint Garland and he would speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team wouldn’t worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the US Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garlands nomination, being Lachians and assistants of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was inadequate for the president’s office.
Treats Wants Naked Calendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats Magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of renowned people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
Treats chief editor Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine differs from Old School Playboys since "Playboy for Men".
I'm doing it for women.
He seems to think that the calendar does it too.
"We need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nakedness, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass refuge
"Whoever does not adapt and praise Erdogan is sitting on packaged bags," said the Chairman of the Gulen-Nearby Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany estimates in the short term tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempt to push, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass escape to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with some hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," Ali Toprak said on Friday.
Because the government has already overthrown Kurdish Hochburgers with criminal offences months ago, 500,000 Kurdish within Turkey are fleeing.
After the requirement of putch, even more secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will begin again in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.
“It can’t be that a state that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The alliance chief complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitic cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurdish.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, where Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or displaced in the last hundred years," Toprak, a member of CDU, said.
The alliance chief called for the federal government to "posite itself as strongly as Austria positions against Erdogan and his followers".
In Germany there is also a “Heavy Hunt” against Erdogan’s critics.
I don’t feel safe for the first time in Germany in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen Movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, particularly Kurdish and opposition.
The brand marking as a follower of Gülen destroys the vocational existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praise Erdogan is sitting on packaged bags, including Kemalists and Secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gulen-near-Stiftung Dialogue and Education, the "World".
According to the newspaper, reporting on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the rupture.
By June 30, this was 11,386 people, and thus nearly 29 percent of all asylum-recognized (39,625).
This raise does not find those who fled before war, poverty, or unperspectiveness.
Asylum entitled under the basic law are solely politically, i.e. by state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election race with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westfalen may not choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommers, they have understood.
The 2021 country election will not be held again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For blood isn't going to be so far: summer holidays, heat and country election fights - that's the same.
The locals to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
Most holidaymakers in the country on Usedom, Rigs or Hidden Lake are not indigenous, so you should not choose the country day.
There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers hanging the posters, blowing air balloons, distributing flyers, and counting votes at the end of the day, are only hard to drive.
Until September 4, 2016, on the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must again leave the election race near the people.
The hot phase, when you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now under investigation behind the CDU.
It will be exciting how strong newling AfD is cut and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making a nearly unprecedented election campaign, you can see from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and blows a little with the people, as did his legendary wortcarrity predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, sealing has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the inheritance of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, your "We Create That" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is likely to cost him now the beautiful office.
The CDU with her top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make a match at the right place.
She has two times invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large customer engagements; Merkel’s Bundestag election district is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburgers and Prepommers.
"There was probably the majority from other federal countries," Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained recently in the NDR.
But it’s also harmful to nobody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual election stops on market places and before shopping malls with sunscreens and air balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that in the country she broke the base that she has to make a lot of effort to find a wire again to the people.
You are going like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the regions of the country it is hardly present.
However, the council of the CDU election warrior Cokert to his colleagues is also self-confident: “They must go where it hurts, namely where people are: villages, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used.”
Because there is much in the game, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a specially engaged election race.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last behind 22 percent partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 elections, the SPD was still clear to win by 35.6% before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, may create the jump into the countryday.
They make the vacation emergency a modern garden and put their election race largely on the internet.
"Online election fight," Claudia Müller, President of the country.
Otherwise, green election fighters are searching for local voters among the holidayers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just curving a boat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and finds it beautiful.
Their impression: "Wahrlur leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27 Scanning: Guests suffer from blockage
At the speed with which the B 27 is sanitated, there is nothing to crash.
For those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5:30 a.m. and ending only at 20 a.m., there is praise.
"They've done everything pretty dirty," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet tank station.
That's a super team.
There is no delay, too.
The construction site could be planned to move to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything is ready.
It is also welcomed the return of those responsible for construction work, for example when it comes to establishing aid entry.
Since the construction site has walked south on Monday and the shutdown of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been cancelled and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has also been resumed, the traffic situation within the site has relaxed.
Citizens can now move both sides from the B27 from Freterdingen.
The carriage seems to go back through the site.
"There were some significant complaints," said Florian King, Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for the management of traffic technology.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many of them were looking for sliding paths and more familiar with their Navi than the warning.
This resulted in some trucks in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality demanded to strengthen the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant oversights," says King, who once made himself able to talk about the situation on site.
They have been blinded two to three per minute.
The fastest was on the road with 77 hours kilometers in the tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved, it has become more calm.
For businesses at B 27, it is just a little comfort that the road is now open again to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27 scanning has led to sales breaches with them, everyone asks to see.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer" so produced for other companies, for which the recovery has hardly consequences.
Also at the autohouse Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximumly light drop", but also agrees that, of course, "the running skills are missing".
The most used are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.
This is already existence threatening.
Not just him, but all the hosts have "happily touched it".
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We have to be happy with every euro sale.
The sales inflations refer to "more than 50 percent".
The road recovery has rejected its operation "about two years".
Half of his employees had to be released.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the statement that the hosts would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now they should also bear the disadvantages resulting from the recovery.
Göhner knows from other rural circles, where such a kindness has been handled a little more generous.
With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his host will continue.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, refers to the long history.
The fact that other tribal guests now look less frequently over due to complicated transportation, he can understand.
If you can’t go, it’s beautiful elsewhere too.
The fact that his stem client returns after the completion of the repair work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird influenza, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction works on his client for the biggest crisis that his hosts have experienced in his long-term history.
Six months of construction, that's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are being scrambled.
After the recent attacks, the Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a debt status have to do with terrorism?
What does the coalition partner say to all of them?
Thomas de Maizière gives the recipient.
All of his proposals are "politically admissible to the coalition partner," the Federal Interior Minister said in the presentation of his new security package.
They're overrequiring nobody.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also participated in this.
But as the Interior Minister, he is situated on results and on a "reatable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière, after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, took some time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But now they seem to be more and more extensive.
Some are already known, advertised, aligned: It is not new that a new security authority should take care of the crash of encrypted communication.
It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU data on passenger data and arms law.
The reputation for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising.
Partly, de Maizière starts a second approach to proposals that have not yet been involved with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and to dismiss the German passport from Djihadists with double nationality.
“That will be difficult points for the SPD,” the CDU man said.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that anyway has no chances for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas present the Maizière as well.
They have partly in themselves: He plans quick discharge procedures and more ways to detain people before discharge.
Refugees who are destined to get to the country must check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
He wants to make some even worse in the case of denied asylum seekers than before - such as those who commit crimes or consciously throw their papers to dismiss their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally weak.
Some are still unexpected and leave questions open.
And in some points - for example, inequalities in the treatment of patience - the question is: what does this actually have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, says Maizière, it is important to distinguish between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it is not possible to dismiss that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people, given the high number of refugees, were concerned about safety.
And things that were deeply busy people could not even climb in election times.
Internal security is greatly focused.
First attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The disappointment is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioned in the matter of internal security.
In the last few days, it has been high between the two parties.
First a sharp dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security-political collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the directors also require a Burka ban and a resignation from double nationality.
De Maizière also has to do with reconciliating sounds here.
From a double passport, he does not hold anything.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Reopen them, don't be meaningful.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually "approachable" for the coalition partner, it must only be shown.
There is a lot in it that could cause disputes.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security.
Sigmar Gabriel, chairman of the party, first signals attentive speech willingness and says: “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security.”
Volkswagen is still bright.
Despite the diesel scandals, the supply numbers are rising worldwide.
But it does not run around in all markets.
In the revocation, there is a spine for a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the sales.
Although Europe’s largest automotive manufacturer in the past year, despite the diesel industry, thanks to its many brands and some well-leading markets, it can continue to offer a plus.
However, in July, the VW brand weakened mostly in Western Europe and reloaded the total sales, as reported by the company noted in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than last year.
Only in Western Europe, according to China, the second-largest market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the domestic market of Germany, the delivery was reduced by nearly a sixth.
Brand dealer Jürgen Stackmann led the weakest figures from July to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there has been a retention of purchases in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation around the pitfall attempt in Turkey, the UK vote also charged to leave the EU, a spokesman explained.
In the U.S., where the gas sector first escalated, a minus remains booked.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected homemark of the Lower Axis, however, continues to shine through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery min of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is booked.
Fred Kappler, CEO of the company, was able to further submit a salesplus from January to July.
At this time, 1.3% more vehicles sold by Volkswagen, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust gas testing.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for refurbishment in the workshops.
During the reconstruction, VW confirmed that the reconstruction of the cars had no negative effects.
After reconstruction of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car builder issued a "warranty equal" certificate to the customer after the rearrangement, but does not speak of a "warranty", as it was said in corporate circles on Friday.
The reason is legal subtlety.
The Focus has reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for re-equipped diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Transport Ministry on Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigation commission and of the KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) in a statement.
VW has taken the warranty that there are no deteriorations in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after reconstruction and that all vehicle values pertinent for type-approval have unchanged stock.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "warranty" as it was called in business circles.
With the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop about half a year after refurbishment with a motor damage – and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Also in customer interest it is important to avoid that in any other damage that does not have to do with the exhaust gas scandal, there is an uncertainty in respect of possible guarantee schemes, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "warranty".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund on the Tegernsee requires rich savings future penal interests - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: “It’s only about 139 customers parking €40 million on Giro or daily cash accounts.”
The Federal Federation of German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal: Normal savings should "not be afraid to pay for their gross penalties."
Storing banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay its 0.4 percent penalty interest.
This fee requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September to refund private and corporate customers for deposits over €100,000 on giro or daily cash accounts.
“The first 100,000 euros are free.”
“The next 100,000 will cost €400 per year in the future,” Paul said.
He has over time kept €40 million, which could be withdrawn from one day to the other, and which he could not use.
"They are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs," the bank chief said.
“I can’t pay €4000 for any million.”
The cost will continue according to the causer principle.
Just putting cash in the Raiffeisen Bank’s treasuries would be too dangerous: “I’ve already experienced four injuries, I don’t want the fifth yet,” the bank manager said.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few people walked to other banks.
The association of Bavaria said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes significant costs to all banks".
Wear them alone is "extraordinary economically impossible".
Therefore, some German banks have increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thüringer Volks- and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land with its 2014 Taxbank branches had made strike headlines with penal interests for deposits from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, head of business of the Banking Association, said, "We do not expect private customers to have to pay extensively payments for deposits, so the competition in Germany is too strong among banks and savings cashes."
A banker said in Tegernsee there was "a client equipped with a slightly narrower property".
“That can be a problem for a small bank,” if she cares for money for free.
Founded in 1911, the co-unionsbank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region are known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
“There are no other banks currently known to the association of Bavaria that calculate an expenditure for private customers’ deposits,” said Speaker Ernst.
Uwe Fröhlich, the President of the Federal Federation of German People’s Banks and Raiffeisenbanks (BVR), said at the end of June: “The threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very, very high.”
Competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the width.
Destination plates: who actually buys sound plates?
Lonely men of medieval age love plates.
Before entering the comment to overcome it under the pseudonym Not AllAsociated Men of the Middle Ages with harsh traumas, this statement is based on current data.
According to YouGov, the widespread resurfacing of sound discs is not on a tree in Millennials that wishes to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are expected to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horden by hobby collections - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56 % vs. 53 %) and enjoy spending time alone (69 % vs. 66 %).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog was a news report on television, I would follow the camera while running in a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey dress and wildly dressed before I stay standing, holding my hands and saying something definite like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
So let's look at it.
Although Soho’s heart is slowly in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a dozen of fantastic plate specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I am close to different men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and comfort by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, I follow by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men of the middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men of the middle age, a woman, probably about 20), is a long day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These sound plates, illustrated above (he sent me the pickup board by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates he couldn’t give when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and pleasurable.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them to me," he said.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and enjoy spending time alone, and adds, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink too much.
That's my laster.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meet apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media heap, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old plates again.
Of the talks that I have conducted, people usually have removed their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again," he said.
This would explain the boom to supporters of the plate revalidation of a particular age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that plate shops offer a calm community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the elderly customers have been involved in the contactless payment system.
Some board fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw from the stability of familiar sound boards, from objects that await happy youth memories.
“I think, sometimes it can be a kind of comfort to fill a vacuum or possess material property,” Wez says.
That's what I'm a collector and I think that's what a lot of people do.
It is a simple way to engage spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" a staffer from a plate stack out.
A survey from the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a plate last month haven’t listened yet.
The survey also found that 41 percent own a plate player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate do not own a plate player.
At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while browsing Bossa Nova compilations through a stack.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data Number: Three Men of Medium Age) has noticed a "Trophean Aspect" of the Revival.
“Someone just came in here recently and said, ‘I don’t own a plate player, but I’d like to buy a radiohead sound plate so I can put it in the backyard,” he said.
This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-loaded, less music-loaded.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plate player."
These are younger people, not older people, who only come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted the sound plate to almost a whole floor, has a more colorful audience than I entered.
There are couples around the 70, tourists taking photos, teenage girls and women of middle age.
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above stores – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packaged pop instead of experimental jazz pulls out of the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity with customers.
None of them look lonely, but naked mental traumas are difficult to fix when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
It makes a shower bubble rather than a wholesale shopping.
She doesn’t deserve much, so collecting plates isn’t a real option, she says.
It's a lot.
It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of the plates is..." it drives off with a loving seafood.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that says a new generation of plate lovers have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to pattern the Jeans-Hotpants, I watch a group of young teen girls who group themselves around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley plate player.
On the left is a staircase house, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, which are essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at it - perhaps because they’re just purely decorative, some so far above that it’s impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art".
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most of the luxury items like plates.
Although my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they allow, at least in plate stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and lovers of plates that exist in reality, plate stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in office.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday tomorrow bumping through Berwick Street’s plate shops and leaves through plates, while avoiding the strict look of an uncomfortable, 30-year-old fake moderator who seeks to inquire about no scary men of medieval age over their shoulders.
Greenlandhai is the longest-living spine animal - Video Report
Scientists say the Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all spine animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, an investigator of the hae, says that the record was at a woman from which it is expected to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court refuses to offer off shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected the offer of the authorities in Calais, decreasing dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.
In a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to deploy 72 provisional stores in which people within the warehouse were selling goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdrying services, or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or selling simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be lowered because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would raise a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups reported to the court that shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in stock.
They also suggested that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in emergency.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 provisional businesses, but concluded that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who live in extremely prey conditions.
He said the areas offer peaceful meetings between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the downfall was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids’ Café, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals per day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum issues for the hundreds of minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closing would be a disaster for these children who have been eight years old.
The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steady increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympics, bike professional Tony Martin will not be allowed to sign up.
“I continue to keep the World Cup in sight, stay confident and fight on Thursday,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place at the sugar.
“It’s really hard to comment on the time of yesterday,” Martin said.
He should be able to analyze the reasons for the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time bike championship in October in Qatar.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed in recent times.”
"This is also my position," the three-time world champion wrote, who lost more than three minutes on the Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54,5 km.
Olympia: Tennis team Siegemund misses the semi-final
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinal of Rio: The World Rating Lists-32. from Metzingen was missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) The semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament is clear.
Siegemund, which was painted by back problems, was able to carry out his rifle only once and acted unforgivingly compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the pre-run.
The Australian Open winner hit the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis prof, Tommy Haas had won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had been last in 1992.
There was never a German duo at an Olympic single semi-final.
Group will start up for live video game streaming
Watching other people when playing video games is a huge center - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology company buys the start-up Beam that specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the purchase, Microsoft did not report on Thursday.
Beam started with its offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others when playing, but also interfere yourself.
For example, they can give up the players missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment objects.
The player’s Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already suspended.
The start-up employees who have their headquarters in Seattle, Washington, United States, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam founder and chief Matt Salsamendi.
Nothing should change for customers by taking over.
Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video gaming activities is currently growing slowly.
Popular platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by Amazon in 2014 for nearly one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google's mother's alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s raser needs to set up the next generation of speed meters: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashing devices are tested, which should be particularly effectively transmitted.
For example, the futuristic enforcement trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on highway buildings or bridges with temporary pace limit, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that there is a stationary flashing for compliance with speed limit.
A lasting mobile construction, however, can be too dangerous or excited.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: its battery lasts five days when continuously measured, the fall data is encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can be captured simultaneously through several traces.
Variable speed limits as well as time, driving tracks and vehicle class traffic bans can also be monitored.
In high-risk condition, you can move the sticker according to the manufacturer with any car with sticker coupling.
In order not to be easily crushed, it is cut in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the panned and, in other words, also off-season walls.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the blister from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in various federal countries, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities also shine with the new technology: France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK takes silver in 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of the UK at the 7th Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to a sudden stop at the last obstacle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in action, side-stepping, backstage, line run and raw force to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was soaked by the uncomfortable comfort prize of the silver medal – Britain’s fourth day – and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The significant defeat of the boxes, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall on them in the final.
But regardless of it, Fiji would have beat a 15-man team in this form in best shape.
It could be a comfort for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind him.
Eight years ago, Ryan lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they only lost one.
This bitch will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs go out of entertainment.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in buses, the World Series winner went up to 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau climbed in the corner.
With another four minutes of playtime, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he transformed.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A great tackle of Mitchell stopped achieving Man's Mount Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but Fiji just stopped it.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua put a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa has added a new since the reapfiff and there was still more than a minute of play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou went through other weak tacklings of the GB team and jumped up to the line to make a door.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the pause.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning about it.
That's how it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-life and closed the Fijian block...for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-life until Joshua Tuisova passed after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has been left for a long time in favour of the South Islander whose fans sing, swing flags and dance on the tribin.
It was not hard to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-top with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff nodded, the Fijis stumbled, and GB kicked devastatingly into the grass.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5, and Britain threw South Africa in a near semi-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and reached a door under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win — and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting the coach’s cancer to win
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games, and that’s what it means.
From the first rudder hit to the last, 220 hard Hieves who entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two sitting on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was out of the presence of the second Olympic gold in the second without taxes, the first women in the history of the British sport that set such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, however, her 39th unexpected effort, which is also unexpected.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who slide over the surface with the elegance of swings, which does not reflect the kind of triumph.
Behind every gold in the spine, a battalion of willing helpers contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who knew 30 months ago if he would survive that day at all than cancer was diagnosed with him.
As he said, there's something risky.
I had breast cancer that was operational and that was what they did.
If you don't do that, he spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It a little changes the perspective.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio had luck that he was treating early 2014, outside the season, could start, which kept the interruption at a minimum if under such circumstances it was the right term at all.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
It is already a challenge to rotate itself, but that makes it even bigger.
In the impermeability of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than anything else, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a chief at the Royal Artillery Regiment in an effort in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wrack this week. That may be something extremely, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me how much Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t want a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn’t meet.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very imprisoned at the moment.
Helen called, "Stand in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to break down.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't supposed to do something great.
Today we didn’t want a firework, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must appear on a wedding next week with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” she said.
Example provided for clarity for 31 years
Ruppert Göller, director of the Water Target Association "Veitenstein Group", is retired.
The association is regarded as "Bayerwide Example".
A small frozen drinking water targeting association as an example for the large water producers.
This was the name of the original tone some time ago in a contribution of the Bavarian broadcast.
Shortly afterwards, the Water Forum of the Government of Subfranken respected the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was considered "bayernwide as an example".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years of employees in the purpose association, 28 years of which as CEO.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group with its headquarters in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, promotes approximately 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and weilers with approximately 5,500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities include the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Mayor of Breitbrunn Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as waterwart in 1985 and was appointed director of the purpose alliance in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and have extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," the President said.
As an outstanding event, it called the introduction and introduction of new sources (1994), land purchases in the field of new sources (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of high tanks (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There was no stop, and we have repeatedly embraced innovations because water life means and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and accurate service for 31 years.
He has committed himself with a lot of heartblood for his water-purpose association and has regularly lived the water-purpose association, as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district of Subfranken.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised waterwatt Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He was the best waterguard and he was a faithful knock.
Together we were an invisible team.
As high points from his point of view, he described the foundation construction and the restructure of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and hardest use was the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
There was a need to work around the night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Also, the supply of neubruns can only be maintained, because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with shells.
The management of the drinking water target association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, following Rupert Göller's succession.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko openly addresses the autism of her son Tiago and addresses other affected parents: “They must have the courage to talk about it.”
"Medication has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease has been identified with her son, she believes she must die.
The eight-year-old Tiago, however, has progressed well and now learns privately in New York, where he gives the best therapist.
"To give an example: if I ask him what's left for two years when I sang Scala at Milan, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Joseph Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man shoots a companion
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10:45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and injured her.
"The man himself called us and said he had shot his comrade," a police spokeswoman said.
The transgressor is on the escape, and after him is publicly convicted.
At the same time, Sven S. could be on the way with the car.
The man is approximately 1.80 meters wide, muscle, brown and has a smoothness.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a smoothie.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He can still carry the gun, the police say.
Whoever sees Sven S. will call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relation state."
The victim was 1988, the offender in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck didn’t initially want to make any information about the breakthrough or the relationship between criminals and victims, but she confirmed that a person was killed.
"It's a murder crime."
“We don’t say more,” a police spokesman in Lübeck said.
According to eyewitnesses, a special use commando (SEK) was on the site.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The heavy-duty and energy-intensive German steel industry remains deprived of additional costs at millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the industry from the eastern space promotion are from the table.
It remains in the release of the renewable energy production system in the stock plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Journal" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really pleased that we finally reached that after two years of negotiations.”
The European Commission, therefore, had initially planned to ask steel manufacturers to use the gas from the high oven to produce electricity for their own consumption to cash.
The steel industry, according to the German Industry Association, threatened additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million a year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a principle initiation with the EU Commission after negotiations with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in steel works, a 20 percent EEG scale falls.
But this will not be raised in the steel industry as well.
The IG Metal welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.
Thus, the status quo of the current regime will be largely set.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are particularly important.
“In terms of our campaign ‘Stail is the future’, this is the first step.”
"We have to follow more."
"In the reform of emissions trade, climate and employment goals are also considered," IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation continued to deteriorate as China’s world’s largest producer country, in view of the weakening domestic demand, has thrown massive steel into the world market.
European manufacturers have introduced price dumping to Chinese steel groups.
During this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties show the effect of import steel, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China increased.
It is unclear how sustainable price recovery is.
The German industryprimus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reduction.
Thyssenkrupp did not ultimately wish to exclude the closing of individual works.
In the German steel industry, late 2015, about 86,000 people were employed.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
They produced 3.4 million tonnes 6% less raw steel than the previous month, according to the Economic Association of Steel on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the production amount now declined after the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been 2% below the previous year’s value.
The association is expected in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increase in emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for seniors
The song has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her lifetime: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher-study she held the special music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Song moves me – emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, happy and overall alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good for her health and mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with equal senses, hackers describe.
Through regular meetings, seniors can connect and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures are often resolved in age, a chore is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To speak and organize, to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of gathering."
Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, Hacker says.
At the same time, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On elderly people sings often have a very special effect, Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Community of Senior Organizations says.
In the older generations, the common song had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lence often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song texts and particularly melodies, people who are dementia diseased themselves are experiencing long-term events.
When singing, the head also requires a special performance, Lenz explains.
Focusing at the same time on your own voice and on a default rhythm and adapting to the other singers – this is a major cognitive challenge.
Just elderly people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show myself: When I exercise for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby shouldn't hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who's listening to a ton?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.
If someone from the familiar circle sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also provide an overview of the Chörs in the surroundings.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly.
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet may ask for help from the family, friends, or neighbours in search of the Internet.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, the hacker advises.
Singing does good to the soul and has something that liberates - this applies to any age.
Cats respond more sensitively than cats to the cries of the young animals
Biologists in Hannover have studied the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
In addition to surprises, the men did not get cold, but they were always the same as the women.
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babes in the midst of the little ones.
They respond by ten percent faster to the sounds of cats that weigh in great need, as scientists found from the Veterinary College and the Hannover Medical College (MHH).
Cats also respond to the calls of cats - but always the same.
“Obviously, the acoustic differences between the Miae of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not of significance for men,” said the biologist Wiebke Konerding by MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous survey, the research team had already found that the duration and height of the kitten screw differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the maintenance of MHH.
They were played for a call by little ones who were taken out of the worfbox for three minutes and separated from mother and sisters.
On the other hand, they were faced with shouting by more excited cats, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be expressive despite the low sample.
“All women, even those who have not had their own descendants, responded differently to the screaming,” Konerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this voice played by the very excited cats.
This ability may be born or develop with the gender maturity.
“A surprise was that the men had responded at all,” the biologists said.
In the past, scientists have studied many times in humans the reactions of women and men to baby noises.
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies, whether they were already mothers or not, biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski grew with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest order has been issued against the invasive football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the punishment attempt, a major football game will take place again in Turkey.
Before the duel of the erz rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly stated: "Business as usual".
Even when the emergency state was imposed after the attempted relapse in July, the government claimed that the daily life of normal citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which is responsible for the punishment attempt.
This will not be stopped before football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor issued a detention order.
As a result, the Sukur currently living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is to be the follower of predicator Fethullah Gülen, responsible for the punishment attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the exceptional state was initially imposed for 90 days until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country announced that Erdogan has stopped Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into Erdogan's supporters and opponents.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Worker Club traditionally do not belong to the President’s friends.
But in the light of dramatic experiences in history, the greatness of the Turks is the strict rejection of military puppets.
Even the fans themselves agree – whether their heart strikes for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At the Cup winner "Gala" it will come again to Lukas Podolski.
In the last season, the Coloner proved his sporting value: With 17 doors and nine patterns in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first game time as a topcorner of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he won the 1:0 winners.
The newspaper "Fantastic" excited him: "He was the best on the spot."
He finished the season in a great way and secured the championship of his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record master found a reconciling finish.
After the pre-running K.o in the Champions League, the "Lion" also took place early in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it was only ranked six.
The season wasn't good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"This is what we did and that is the most important," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who put the base on the 14th title with 26 seasonal meetings as Super-Lig Tower Shield King.
This is also why the fans continue to hope the 31-year-old return.
The contracted and loaned at Besiktas only Gomez had announced after the attempt to put it, because of the political situation in the country after his EM leave.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say it," cited the magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
But the storm must be willing to give up about a third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman said: “We cannot pay its wage at Florence.”
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was closed twice due to dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other overwhelmed body athletes can only laugh about it - they're fighting for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the titles of the Olympics in Rio.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had complained of her right to start after a doping shutdown just before the game, was unpleasantly exploded and exploded at her start (100 meters of breast).
There was a stunning scenario: With a ridiculous smile she was still proud of the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When he found out that she wouldn’t get gold, the audience broke into a Jubilee storm.
However, there are still many other athletes who will start at the Rio Olympics despite the doping past.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m staff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in the body athletics.
He was closed twice due to doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and the former world champion has run even faster than before, he has been number one in the world in over 100 meters in 9.80 seconds and is considered the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m season/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time world champion had to hold a six-month block after the intake of the oxycodon was demonstrated.
She had severe teeth pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discussion/Croatia): 2011 was tested positively by the 2012 Olympic winner, 2013 world champion and 2010 to 2016 European champion on the prohibited stimulans fund Methylhexanamin.
Perkovic contested the conscious intake and was shut down for six months.
The four largest worms this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m Staff/US): The Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and closed 21 months.
One of the means for penis enlargement was responsible for Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): A few athletes have been so many medals later known.
Thus, Tichon lost his 2005 championship title nine years later after his testosterone doping was detected.
Currently, the 40-year-old also had to issue Olympia Silver 2004 due to steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
He also received the famous bronze medal of the 2008 Olympics due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
With 80.04 m, he is ranking two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world recorder and gold favorite was tested positively only in May, but may still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, evidence of the intake of a prohibited supplement was found, the blockade of the WADA World Anti-Doping Agency dropped mildly and dropped already on July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - More deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, said Friday morning.
She suffered cutting injuries and was treated in the hospital, but this could already leave again.
Her home trip was planned for early September.
Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by the other explosions on the island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
The Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok, had two bombs exploded first on Thursday night in an outlet district.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, two explosives rose up again, with another man killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was reported from Phuket in the early days.
At the detonation near the popular beaches of Patong, a taxi driver was injured, according to police.
In Surat Thani on the southeastern coast of the country, another bomb was exploded, killing a city employee.
According to the authorities, the explosion has gone into the air in a flower bed before the coastal police magazine.
Finally, several injured in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and Chumphon on the southeast coast were required.
You're going to have a relationship with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombing attacks carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee said early Friday before journalists.
“We expect it to be a coordinated attack.”
It’s too early to express itself on possible motives, but it’s probably about the acts of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the contrary, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamic uprising movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received secret notices of future attacks in the south of the country – however, unless they had been informed of the exact time and locations.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police urged their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are still smaller bombing attacks in Thailand, but mostly they do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used by King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.
According to the recent explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) was valid for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travels to these provinces are advised.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) was valid for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution developed by the military junta.
This will also have great influence on the military in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos while the country is moving towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.
The military round, which had taken power after a phase of bloody disturbances in 2014, makes itself beneficial to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to capture the rise of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6,500 people have already been killed.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the recent history of the country.
The right "Identifying Movement" has been found in the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the constitutional defenders have also placed the group under observation in the union.
"We see points for endeavours against the freely democratic fundamental order at the ‘Identity Movement’," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, Defence Chief of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffamated in extremist manner.
That’s why we’re watching the movement as well.
The "Identity Movement" is a group of French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It refers to "multicultural wage", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "the loss of its own identity by overfreeding".
Constitutional defenders in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thüringen - have already observed the "identities".
Maassen said that his authority had agreed closely with the national courts in the decision.
"Groups such as the 'Identifying Movement' are trying to get their target group where they are," the head of the Constitution said.
In general, extremists try to address them with a younger language, often with poppic music.
This is what Islamists did as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a beneficial advertising for your own thing.
Propaganda is to respond to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there were reports from several federal countries on contacts of "idents" to AfD politicians.
He said that he had no knowledge.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the party - in this case the AfD - changes its target direction by certain people who are extremist and becomes so extremist.
Therefore, it is crucial whether such persons have a taxable influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
With regard to the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Maaßen said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard.
But in recent years, we have found that there may be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It may be clear that other right-wing terrorist groups or smaller groups are planning to form attacks on asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, the control of legal terrorism across Germany or across Europe is not recognisable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern about the fact that many attacks on the account of people who had not previously occurred in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects were previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that have previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent, or have elected, for example, CDU, SPD or left, but who have then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet Hit
The Olympics or World Records do not always determine the titles of the Olympics.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swims so slowly that it was temporarily no longer seen in TV images.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends his predecessor with a residue of 48 seconds, covering 59th place of 59 stars.
But it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian received a special start-up right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first top names quickly made the round.
Some media called it "Robel of the Wal".
The English boulevard magazine "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" became funny about him.
His time, he hit only one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, was no matter.
Compared to "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani’s race gave media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to walk in a freestyle course of more than 100 meters alone.
Freneticly Moussambani was fired at the time.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store on the New Place has been killed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at 17.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8:15 p.m., about €250 were gone out of the cash.
No traces of the offender could be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the threatening election
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election event in Florida.
If there is nothing in the US election, Donald Trump has an alternative idea.
He then goes on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, it wouldn’t matter to him: “It’s finally going to be either falling, or I have a very, very beautiful, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the U.S. television CNBC.
If it’s not rich for him at the end for political correction, it’s okay,” Trump said.
This is how he named U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the founder of the Islamic State terrorist militia (IS).
Inside his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post rises in trade with electrical transporters
An electric vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company seems to be great.
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
The company will soon start trading with the transporter.
The post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market next year.
"We want to go into sales to thirds," said a post spokesman on Friday.
For months, the company has been checking whether it is intended to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with letters and packages, to other companies.
Post office Jürgen Gerdes had said that demands were repeated, for example, by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Mirgel", the Bonner Group will soon increase the mass production of the vehicles.
In the positioned manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the company wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and to pile a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said in late July.
I can imagine we're going to rebuild the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active in Germany’s streets since 2014.
GfK management declines after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK showed that the chair of Chairman Matthias Hartmann will be more uncertain for the long-term successes he promised.
Turbulences at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After re-deceiving business numbers and the resignation of the company’s management, the global number Five of the industry is a new start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already separated from the Supervisory Board with effect on 12 September.
The board of directors will already take over the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on September 1, the company reported.
He is supposed to officially take over the function of a "government spokesman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy guidance.
A company spokesman did not want to appoint details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investment circles, on Friday, the disappointment of the remaining successes of the restructuring initiated years ago was great for the shareholders.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK headquarters since 2011.
"The fruit of restructuring is not yet seen after five years," he said.
Given the latest bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will be discouraged at some point.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do that,” he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss trip even in the second quarter of 2016 after retreats in the prequarters.
With EUR 361.2 million, revenue was 6.1% below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Regarding the first half of the year, sales decreased by €721.2 million by 3.4%.
The profits in the second quarter loaded primarily the company’s decreased value in the light of its difficult economic situation.
The company’s value records of €139 million in Consumer Experience’s business sector protected the company’s loss of €48.2 million under the strike.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had generated a company profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus shut down in Krummhörn in grave: 8 injured
In an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Ironach, according to his reports, had to escape a face-to-face truck, which was partly driving on the counterway.
The bus came right from the street and went into a tomb, as a police spokesman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, people couldn't leave the bus independently," she said.
The firefighter released the prisoners.
Six rescue cars and a emergency medical car arrived at the accident site on the country road 2.
The uninjured travellers were returned from a line bus to Krummhörner district Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators urged the cargo driver and possible witnesses to sign up to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of waste water shall be from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of €2.10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 (up to €2.26) and for Azendorf 3.64 (up to €2.18).
At the installation in Azendorf, the wastewater fees will be increased again at the latest when appropriate improvements are needed.
After a excessive calculation, the price of wastewater in Azendorf will then be at €4.37 per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that these wastewater plants were undercovered.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, due to legal grounds, to operate the investments covering costs.
As of October 1, 2016, citizens, as well as industrial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to enter the money bag deeper.
Tax increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
According to the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt, a recalculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.
Between October 2016 and September 2020, over-relative or subcoverages from the previous calculation period will also be compensated.
Schmidt found that all three wastewater facilities are relatively small with a very low wastewater attack that lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the output of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining.
In addition, in the recurring calculation period, all three plants have not last affected significantly due to their age of repair and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the Azendorf wastewater plant due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumpwork, the 20-year-old transportation facility had to be overreached from the ground and, after nearly 20 years of operation, Lopp had to be deployed by the first cluster, the cluster cluster discharged and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in the future in order to fulfil the water regulations.
Schmidt: "For these exceptional costs, the prescribed maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs that were still significantly lower than the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses clearly indicated that in the low wastewater attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance were "fully checked".
In addition, Schmidt added, the market community has remained deprived of high entertainment costs in wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to be pre-permanent from stone houses, particularly as the supply area of the waste-of-water bachtal cannot be extended around these plants because they are deficiency facilities.
Bulgaria booked inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured by the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
In July 2016, a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transportation (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine equipment (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already limits to absurd.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lightenstein painting.
The filters are unforgettable, characteristic disruptive tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All errors come to the public.
Snapchat filters in the past have criticized them as they were accused of promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When some users this week proposed a filter that gave them shells, fake teeth, and dirty wombs, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow Face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies indicated a bigger problem that the company had diversity.
News and emotions were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat reported that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filters of injured cliches.
Others refused to compare the anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American artist whose tweet was widely used over the photos, wrote that the filter was "injured and unpleasant," said.
He added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrary transfer of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face has been drawn to the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural glorious wire.
The American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are in matters of races more diverse than their older counterparts - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive for a user, “it’s much harder to keep such things unnoticed than before,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and media engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account, urged others to do the same.
In a media set and a telephone interview, she said that she believes racial disputes reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s attitude practices.
Zhu criticized the mainly white, only male leadership, and ended their set with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"They either have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their work so they can make such decisions," the Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have people with other skin colors working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or well-being to say what else."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat mostly left unresponsibly.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but, according to a spokesman, the company recently appointed a staff manager focused on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said she would be left to close her Snapchat account and added, “I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K..”
Military leadership misleads ISIS Secret Service Information, the Committee of Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news service information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would allow the actual situations on site, a committee of the Congress investigated in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, prepared by a task force of the Republican Armed Forces Committee members, the Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports of great discontent with Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how presidents changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly called Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Information of news services, typically denied by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly draw a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would allow the actual situations on site and were constantly more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper said in the report.
"What happened to Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analysis is presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, said.
The management errors in Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in training Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government tops under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponded to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom family publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, it is so clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress Deputy of Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the news reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called on the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense are in gang.
Democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process for the creation of news services assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," senior Democrat in the committee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, said in an opinion.
This process, Mr. Schiff, “delayed the publication of news reports,” damaged the morality among analysts and “given too little space for divergence opinions.”
But Mr. Ship and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence of the intervention of the White House by Centcom analysts regarding a "consequent political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon Inspector-General, which were recorded after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant C. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress reports while the investigations of the Inspector General are still in gang.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim, which is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year’s allegations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of secret information about the Islamic State reminds of conflicts of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a letter about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only a small group of occupation in Iraq and a little time related to thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government authorities, noted that contrary to government statements of air strikes against refineries held by the Islamic State, had no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries had operated to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by legislative members because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The U.S. wins the fourth match in women’s field hockey, a showdown with the UK
One day after she shot three doors over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American field hockey team for women in a match on Thursday against India that American girls won 3-0.
Five doors in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember what she had ever done.
"I don't know," she said.
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, which remain unfinished after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will get the first and second place.
The first placed will leave the strong Dutch girls a little longer the way the other group leads.
Whatever the game may come out on Saturday, Americans have caused a surprise spin because of their success history, four years after they landed at the last 12 places at the London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey striker in her hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), when she was 16 years old, she became a US national player, the latest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the framework.
Then came the year 2012 in which everything was broken for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a national team coach, and so things began to turn to better.
“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn't have the work funds in London that we have now.
We were able to complete the rudder.
On Thursday night Bam opened the Torreigens in the first half of the game with a retreat from the neighbouring area.
India had gone to the game without a win, but the team was surprised and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and fought the ball into the door to give the American girls a 2-0 guide.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. gatekeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to break a door in any of the previous games so far.
She's got a run.
It's like Bam.
“We are in a good position,” Parnham said, but how well it will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampolin
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constant and inevitable, a fast season race between competition and strife.
It’s like the Olympic rack itself is a burning staff that is driven from the bracelet to the swimmer to the tournament to the triathlet.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s talk at the Coffeshop’s snake, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympics and is a women's sweat with turkeys, could be quite among those known names that are broadcast to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertisements if he was a swimmer, a turner or even a moisture.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolin tours.
The Olympic flame does not light every event the same.
Out of the center, partly in the shadow, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, arrow shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the swim and let it rule for a long time.
But if I modestly make arguments for my particular beloved, then let me focus on the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampolin jumping has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so spectacular for the past 16 years that many of those I had asked didn’t know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the race, it never won a medal in the trampolin jump and had a athlete who managed to finish it until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medal this year.
The trampolin jumping has a certain external shadow, partly because it sounds more suitable for an unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthen enthusiast.
It has a humorous potential - the cartoon crash of its never-went blow - but also the Grazie of the tournament and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "sprayboard".
Rising winners jump on a gigantic trampolin, shoot up to almost 30 feet in the air and have to have a series of falling movements (drawns, heights and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty degree and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are going to meet each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is just.
Medal hopes must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and above, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the target line or the output wall, but also in television streaming another hockey target: the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted strife is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even push a spectator to tears.
But that’s what I even feel tired when watching these games.
From this, Trampolin offers a breathtaking break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A move forward is not the goal.
He or she blows down, apparently heavily like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then hardly back up.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant withdrawal of time and gravity.
It is just as Zen can be the competition at the Olympics.
Women’s qualification and ending rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 East Time; those for men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the end rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympics, they promise a quiet, cute moment, one that in general will likely be overlooked.
If consciousness increase can only be achieved by the attack and targeting male athletes - as the male U.S. tournaments suggest recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to reach air.
"A Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long an Allied of the United States
Violence in Ethiopia
Protestants who demand political change in Ethiopia are shooting on a violent resistance to the government.
Witnesses say zig protesters were killed during the collision with the police in shooting shifts.
Is Ethiopia going to break together?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid allied of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last few months, protests against the government have slaughtered the country and expanded into more and more territories.
Last week, thousands of people struck the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was uncompromising.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed on zig unarmed demonstrators.
Videos about the protests, likely from last or early this year, show how security people strike young people with strikes, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Office is now demanding a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the African Horn of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much western assistance.
The Ethiopian economy expanded at a significant pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pencil train in the capital city of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was nothing other than an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continued to lead the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively being silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven to the distances of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to wrath attack with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the Governing Party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this sophisticated, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Ogaden Oregon Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less forced in recent years, could use and re-armed turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of the knife before themselves under the surface.
The first looks harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do regularly, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxys that hide where they stay.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they gathered in such a way to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the ages, the Amharas, who come mostly from Ethiopia, have prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims, and living in flat lands.
But that's just changing too.
"We are in the process of coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which represent about 6% of the population and are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the disturbance is Meles Zenawi's death.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopia’s Prime Minister until his death of an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in percepting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to edit opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been stolen by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, although there were less than in the past few months, and this period of rest was relatively quickly passed.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pencil train, as well as for their measured progress in combating poverty.
Obviously, however, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disadvantage of the Ethiopian government.
And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharian city, attacked shops led by Tigray and hatred against Tigray becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighbouring Somalia, although it recently reported that it had closed the base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to collapse in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gratitude."
Donald Trump declares his allegation that Obama has founded ISIS to have been "Sarcasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to spread the last controversy around his campaign on Friday, stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been the "founder" of the Islamic State terrorist group, seriously.
This statement raised new questions about the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his counterparts who strive to protect him during an eventy phase, to have to explain to the own position statements that he could not have meant at all.
After he made the statement at a election event on Wednesday night, Trump resigned with regard to the claim on Thursday and remained in interviews that he did not really intend to indicate that President and Mrs Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt Trump wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism pushed down on Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus his campaign on declining survey values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton continued to talk about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this issue again.
He warned on Twitter that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring.
Trump has already introduced Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he criticized himself when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I mean that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to need.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then to “clear” depending on how the reaction falls,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even stronger tone as his survey values have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with great predecessor in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head racing in Florida.
While Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he focuses on his presidential campaign in recent months, Trump’s laughter has brought his loyal counterparts to the uncomfortable situation, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent spokespersons, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," Giuliani said, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was a nearly unknown, small organization, he called it backbones, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he left the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, where Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by stop putting the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.
Prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued his attacks on the media and urged them to turn around and be taken against him on each of his words.
He hindered the "poor, dirty" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some Democrats were ashamed of Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was inadequate for the president’s office.
Once the price is overwhelmed by the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay a bar that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prizes of his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were cut off.
Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals disturbed it as the last loss in a vibrant city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I know New York is a change, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, except Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap business.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a new invention.
A rebuilt Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly sharp atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, the owner and manager of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outdoor space, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, held a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the food card are sandwiches with speck and cheese, and there are garments such as cabbage and sauted mushrooms.
There are natural rice bars.
The cafe no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady electricity from old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also expelled by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer recently on a Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had closed, she gave her coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the verb of coffee and culture that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a mixed Chai tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-term and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitablely ordered the same.
"I came four after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they are preparing my Everything Bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and incorporate new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything ball with speck, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he wasn't worried about the soap business had taken up the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brown coffee of the coffee as an ingredient.
“I think we’re still going to get into their offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the food card into Poland and Rodriguez said he plans to put it out soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The location also has additional advantages.
A local coffee shop wants to fill and sell the cold-breasted coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a parent and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that the entrance to the local and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressed food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taste, President Roosevelt had a weakness for refined delicacies on the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland waterschild crust soup.
His menu on this day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purple and as a dessert a potato pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was talking about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman tells in his book "97 Orchard" about living in a living house at Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper Edition on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Ironberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snowy Imbiss in Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the Borse Crash in 1929.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, eating truth with potato purple and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion on food in the era of Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was groundbread, liver cheese, and beanbread.
They were prepared from a ingredient and something cheap that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many nuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinste.
"It must have put it in the stomach like bleeding," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cook for male field workers and it was served freshly cooked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
They were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways with which the country could no longer be the Schlarffenland.
“It was a time when food became a central, exciting topic for the Americans,” Coe confessed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was also stressed: mysterious foods like bread and casserole became basic foods that recycle casserole as "a wonderful way, food residue," Zigelman noted, as cooking could hide unappropriate ingredients under a cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dryer.
Meat, which has been the center of the American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Special mixtures have been tested as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had a priority for taste or even a healthy kitchen mind.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, buckled chickens with grounds butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Soil bubbles and bubbles don't match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have used the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and the challenge of converting pampers such as cream spaghettis to delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical taste bites.
Especially tasty are the reports about the government’s response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-mich-cake-eat holding.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the million-heaviest man in the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gurken sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly golden dining room and weared a smoking.
He was wonderfully real-time.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to statue an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, a homeowner’s homeowner with no interest in taste directions by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting cooking.”
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, were rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs.
The property is based on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple told me to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother, for example, how they couldn't throw food.
"She was really afraid of the loss of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalls, "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind bag crash.
After the tables were dreamed at Ironberg’s, they and Coe set out a dessert they had prepared at home: the flour dessert that President Roosevelt ate in the afternoon.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said and added that it was a common trick to miss a nice name with modest recipes.
There was no slaughtered soap, only flour, a bit of milk, sugar, water and citrus.
Everybody waste a cup of teeth in the teeth, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste badly.
Coe got a three-time breakdown.
Like a can-do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
He was killed in a bombing attack: he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old even died in a fasc bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has rescued nearly 60,000 people so far.
2900 volunteers play their own lives to get people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the group's face: A video of the civilian defender, showing him a 11-hour baby's rescue from a house's cliffs, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a bright symbol in the grey of the war.
As a hero, he never saw himself, said, "For me this is the true Jihad."
"When I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell to the victim, he spoke in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters have thrown four fasc bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from breathing.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture cites his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenland: The oldest spine animal is nearly 400 years old
Rare views.
Greenlands usually come to the surface only in winter.
This hai went back to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel.
He was born in 1624 and swims about 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland animals only grow after 150 years of age.
Groenlandia floats at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of 1.220 meters.
Only when it arrives on it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a robbery.
But this lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a patent therapy for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the magazine "Science" from a Greenlander who could be 392 years old.
"Greatness," Alexander Scheuerlein by the Max-Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this lifespan, which means a world record for spine animals.
Although evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland has been stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland animals are hard to observe, eventually they live in the ice mostly in front of the thinly inhabited coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland.
They measured their temporary air speed when they equip six animals with a transmitter at the top of the mountains.
Nevertheless, these chickens make fruit: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robbery, another had slaughtered the chicken bone of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the base of the lake and seek dead bodies that turn from higher water layers down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now investigated 28 Greenlandians, which were captured by fishermen from 2010 to 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as a relief from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the cores of the hae using the carbon-14 method.
This center of eye lens emerges before the birth of the hae, which proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later.
The two smallest hae had a great deal of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Therefore, their birth should be lasted after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempts dropped larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the animal with a length of 220 centimeters, however, the lenses contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it may have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All larger greenhouses had in their lens cores a normal amount of carbon 14, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14-hour for a 493 centimeter long Greenlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record hair with 502 centimeters may even be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenlandhai women only get offspring if they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers could assign an age.
Since one of the animals of 392 centimeters was likely on the threshold and his age was determined at the age of 156 years, the breeding of Greenland animals is obviously possible for at least a half a century.
This is also likely to be a world record for spine animals.
The fact that such methusalems live mostly in ice waters is no accident.
Also the record holder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwald, whose speck on the neck stepped a 120-year-old harp head, was captured in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals that live there often runs on fire.
So they grow up later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, animals are also often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal enters heat.
Therefore, the heat loss of a gram mouse is much bigger than in a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
“A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many descendants as soon as possible,” explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double package
The Council of the Municipalities has addressed issues about construction at the recent session.
With relief, the Board adopted the Mayor Robert Putz’s statement that “the marketing of newly designated residential buildings can finally begin.”
After clarification of land, parseling and designation issues and the applications were able to be measured, the sale of land in the residential building areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - construction section 1) is no longer available to stakeholders.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rurally constructed and quiet residential community are equally concerned with young families and windy seniors.
As it was said, constructive volunteers can report at the Council immediately, on the award of the parzels will be expected to be consulted by the Municipal Council at its September session.
In order to complie with requests for resettlement of other businesses associated with the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to change the plan of area use in sub-areas that was re-established only in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the sub-time-learning area, the commercial area that has already been established there is extended to two parasols towards State Strasse 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main has the best chances in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to attract jobs and companies relocated from London.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether cash houses can be operated from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, it is enough for them to be admitted in the UK.
This is what big U.S. banks use.
Several banks have already announced the transfer of jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" estimates 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as European insurance supervision EIOPA and the risk council ESRB.
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The closeness to the notes bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision,” says IW professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg owns a large funding industry, it also cuts down as well as Dublin in infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Also point the city with easy-to-use commercial properties.
“In Paris it is not so easy to find free offices of quality,” Voigtländer says.
In addition, rentals for first-class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than at Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less criminality.
In a ranking of Mercer’s corporate advice, the city is on 7th place, Luxembourg on 19th place, Dublin on 33th place and Paris on 37th place.
Although quality of life is a question of preferences, "with its strong position as a financial position for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, economic researchers say.
Force conditions are also discussed: in London, according to the Landesbank Helaba figures, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal expenses from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. has a right to reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million compensation payment for the injury of two Merck patents associated with Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead’s blockbuster drugs, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misbehavior by Merck, including misleading and other ethical acts.
At the appeal on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead had the right to accept the costs arisen during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to compare Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of drugs for hepatitis C that can cure over 90% of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck accused each other and took possession of laboratory work, based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
U.S. Supported troops say they have backed full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-supported troops have returned full control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city, a group spokeswoman said Friday.
Syria’s Democratic Forces (DKS) are crossing after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city, the city is currently.
They have liberated more than 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as prisoners, Sharfan Darwish reported to Manbij Military Rattas allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just carrying out spacework," he said.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released its 2015 taxation statement on Friday, which gave to the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband a $10.75 million income and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in speech loans; the former Foreign Minister gave a $3 million income from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her office in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton’s Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton published his tax statements over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false arguments and backtrackers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not required by law for this.
Trump, a New Yorker businessman, and his lawyers have stated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," Clinton's electoral assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s Special Advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something until the tax checks were completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made clear that his rejection raises issues regarding assets, his donations for charitable organizations, his business and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already collapsed on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet calling for a high-ranking Republican Trump to publish his tax declaration.
On Thursday, she also discussed the topic during a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements," she said.
Politico reported that during the 1990s, Trump did not pay or just pay very little taxes for two years, and a New York Times economist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors that suggested that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its headquarters here to exchange Trump for a meeting on their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also undergoing an IRS tax check and Trump had "anxiety" to voters and not to tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has released a reduction tax declaration by 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton’s 2015 taxation statement showed that it was only $100 of its income as a salary, unlike most Americans.
Their main cash investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton’s dividend and income taxed $109.000.

Condoms with Chilipuder, Fireworks Body Promotes Tanzania Elephant Protection
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unethodox way to prevent elephants from going into people-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which has already had the idea for it, has intensified its promotion, along with U.S. Nature Protection, by training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use a non-violenced four-square method to protect their homes and harvest without injuring animals.
A lot of spears have used to defend themselves before.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with much more confident that they can hold the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a shaft and the blazing in a horn.
If he isn't scared, a so-called "Chili cloud" will be thrown away.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is reached to the flood thread.
When inflamed, the condom rises up with a knife and sprays fine dust on chilipuder into the air.
A hook is usually enough to chase the elephant.
One last option is a werner who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No Kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, St. Goar’s investment projects are taken into account by merchants with cusshand - but the retail in the city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the City Council now unanimously rejected the application for the rebuilding of a salesskiosk on the Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkon in construction.
"We mainly welcome new traders, but in this location exposed at the Rheinufer, this kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath told the CDU Group.
Jewish director ruins Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed for "Arabic" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots captured a media rebel after he had told that Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-elections as Arab guests would have "required" according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann Israel tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country selection list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible for Israel to be eliminated and deleted in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
In search of a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shock him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said the measure was "a deliberate decision to manage the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it was even more angry in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre-election be deleted," Lanzmann said.
Israeli ambassador in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a “great shame,” reports South German newspaper.
We were worried and worried about this event.
That's really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger shame.
That doesn't need any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "make the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident solved a fairly large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some have assumed the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "released" the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"It's a shame to you," he said in another post pointing out that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all charges of himself and called the incident a "incident" and "excuse" at Lanzmann, the Mirror reports.
"There was never direct instructions," Israel would not be included in the quick selection list," the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman from the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country's selection has now been added.
Police use tears and rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday with the police when they met to protest the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police used tears and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties started when police officers tried to fight the students, causing the police to use rubber shots and tears.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their anxiety about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffitis spraying on walls against the preliminary president Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went onto the streets in order to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been voted by the Senate for their withdrawal from the office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the cancellation of sanctions, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade sales between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70,9 percent in comparison.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were revoked, interest in Russian companies in trades in the country has increased strongly, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are connecting with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade development is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5% and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade shift was achieved by delivery of machines, land vehicles and weapons,” the Ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representation issued about 35,000 visa, mainly travel visa, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
“You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes to change.
“I personally may recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state,” he said.
Witness searches: Drinking market in Fordbröl
A robbery was carried out on Thursday night on the beverage market by Rewe XXL at the Forest Bröler Gerberstraße.
In keeping with a shooting weapon, three dark-woven people who had concealed their faces, from the employee of the beverage market, demanded the release of cash and then fled to foot, and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money has been used, the police don’t share.
The offenders should be between 1.60 and 1.70 meters, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park cover of the Rewe market and is poorly accessible.
After the attack, the offenders must run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and escape from the Schotterparkplatz in front of the parking lot with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernrength).
Those who have made observations at the time of action (vs 19.45 p.m.) related to the robbery should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: game and fun at summer holidays
Eight beautiful and happy days the children and teenagers of the Social Education Day Group/social group work of the Children’s Protection Association Nagold with their careers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly situated Holiday home Hardtwäldle, the life-friendly group was united during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
First, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichel Zoo.
Secondly, to Maulbronn, where there was a special child leadership in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Kelten Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Kelts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plans.
Culinaryly, children and caregivers with their own prepared body foods such as the acid spätzle, the seabronner Pfännle, Iselhauser-bloff, the English-breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese were confessed.
In workshops were stored, beautiful jewelry pieces made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mushroom game.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby teeth, the evenings at the fire and the final "bunded evening".
On the day of the return, the sun laughed and the children and youth returned home with satisfaction.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministers from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage journey from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were handled.
In order to overbridge the time to the next round of Rome to all the Ministers in two years, St. Anna's High Minister Round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrim migration.
Various travel destinations were examined and finally decided for the Bishop of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the opening gate of Mercy at Freiburger Münster, a special pilgrim destination was offered.
16 Minis made of wheat, grool, hail hole, and sacred rooms were on the way.
Earlier in the evening, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims to a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrims.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a monster of Our dear wife stands, and so the pilgrimage route was taken from the monster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs, and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made rash to sing together a song from a very composed pilgrim song.
For the nights, each priesthood of the local priesthood was available.
At the stage targets, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a delicious as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, it went over Furtwang to Gütenbach.
In the following days, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most sought-after route, had to climb about 500 meters of height first and then climb again.
The reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Finally facilitated and happy, the minis entered the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was grateful here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the ministers arrived at the pilgrimage target by co-operator Markus Obert were welcomed.
After serving God, the pilgrims could visit the Sakristei and the highest altar.
The next day it was time for the Breisgau Metropole.
In the afternoon he went back to Horb by train.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were characterized.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite Gold is pushing for bike sports
The Scottish Callum Skinner hit last night in the male team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to the reputation when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his landlord Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boyspund made the legend proud when he struck home to hire a victory from New Zealand’s favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy earned the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships in March despite Hoys’ resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hindrance.
Hoy's retirement state created a block that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the Scottish that has now evolved.
In addition, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds, the new Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was almost back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, where Hindes ran in a higher stream to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert, and Skinner, Kenny and Hindes appeared when they climbed on the podest.
The 23-year-old skier from Glasgow said, "It's a sweet comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set an Olympic record in the end and won the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the train after a weak start.
He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.
In such a surprise victory, this time there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the tribin like London."
We have been together in the last three months as a team.
We have gone so bad at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, it expects us to be successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form of Kenny, it is possible to repeat Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny, who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day were born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - an expense of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the same with Hoy.
Kenny will participate in the Sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old of Bolton said, “I just enjoy this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
He said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to rider.”
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-kilometer race.
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the target.
The world record won in 2012 in London Gold was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be confidently focused.
Yesterday he had argued with officers before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record at 4:13,260.
The GB team relys on its strong railroad team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were reduced.
Dramas took place in the background, so the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing proposals as well as the retirement status of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment has reached its peak, can be repeated.
The future of Portland's meltdown due to cancellation of the energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum mixture in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator will cancel the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company notified.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to grant no further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year grant will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be threatened with shutdown.
In addition, there could be domino effects as the melt is consuming about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Smelting series, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s melting series in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years of speculation on the future of the facility, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the facility.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting series with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, reported that it is assumed that three other owners will cancel their contracts.
The plant is mostly owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
"AGL is expected to continue to operate the plant in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting series," the company said.
AGL continued to say that the treaties are so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of cancellation, so that they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impacts on revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale current prices.
AGL stated that it already recorded the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "Waiting for an interruption".
Alcoa said that the decision to expose the contracts, which “the ability of Alcoas to operate the melting chain... or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melting chain” would not affect.
The U.S. company said it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a statement why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn about the possible shutdown of the Portland melting series in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
With regard to the statements by the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumed about 600 megawatts per year and Tomago consumed about 900 megawatts per year.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And for us as an electricity producer, it wouldn’t be good,” he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the cover followed a strange (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian family (except Rob and Caitlyn problem cases, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of all over the world, they have forgotten a classic showspad with Wearing Up with Ryan Seacrest).
This represents the climbing action of almost every birthday episode of a child broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Did you think we would forget you?" with the honesty of a drawing box on a broadcast place at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this advertising somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s great sister Kim liked her to beat her in regards to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a scale that is more similar to an image band than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (which according to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the woodener 615 pages advertising).
The discovery of his cover stars is expected so generously that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine have been swallowed through before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Over the past few years, more "famous" models have been clearly on the cover than "models that are famous" models.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even in the low chance that Ms. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "Durchbruch Model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or Reality Stars or today’s teenagers who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who characterize themselves in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenners’ success doesn’t like everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenners’ position in the fashion world has always been slightly stressed.
In June, Victoria's unique Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the missing pieces of the moment."
These feelings broke up again when the message came out with Jenners appearing on the Vogue Cover.
But on the misfortune, it seems to pass through the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
In the very sense of the word, it is a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she is watching on Reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centres displace 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is dealing with the impact of further intermediate cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five persons - mostly elderly persons, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair delocalisation and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the community, which are already overloaded, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
James Farrell, director of the Common Law Centres of Queesland, said that the last collection of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres found that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would be even worse without a revocation of the federal government’s decision.
"Queenslands municipal law centres are chronicly under-financed, which means that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave the violent relationships, people with invisible and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this examination shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The federal government will shorten the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of more helpful people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Justice Minister as well as the Queensland Senators George Brandis to revoke these shortages immediately so that people can get the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their customer communities, as well as that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump’s election campaign accused after employees allegedly dropped guns
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina had targeted a firearm on an employee while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a prosecutor’s paper, filed in Charlotte’s national court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in the state.
Bordini said he waited for months that the matter would be resolved internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, “draw a gun, put his right finger on the pull, and hit the race in Vincent’s kneekele,” Bordini said in his accusation.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign guide, Bordini noted that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he reported in the prosecutor’s paper.
"Weapons don't need to be fired to get damaged," Bordini said.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a disturbance when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "second Amendment People" - gun owners and arms friends - should take measures if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and should appoint judges.
Trump’s campaign clearly stated that the media would have removed his words from the context and that he would not appeal to violence.
Bordini’s complaint requires damages from the campaign for infringement of care obligation and by Philip for body injury and persistent mental damage.
Trump’s press spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news broadcaster in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
The calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, have not been responded.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Oberstes Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Country election survey: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
These were given representative surveys of the INSA’s opinion research institute for the “Image” Time (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could not go beyond, this is not possible according to surveys in Berlin.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg Prepommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to a survey, the party is located just before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (ahead of 18.4%), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time on the day of the country.
The Greens, despite light losses, were resumed by 6 percent (ahead of 8.7 percent) in the severe country day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3% on the day of the country.
According to the survey, the SPD was only 23 percent (2011 elections: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
They are still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Deputies.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope to return, the pirates would, on the contrary, miss the intake as compared to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighs almost half a kilogram and was more than four times heavy than an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty cool.
The built-in memory initially was eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, to the stores - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they come from the stone era of the Internet.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hannover as a "Office in Western pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could have a lot for those standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the Communicator to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, although desperately slowly.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be clamped like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was greatly proud: 2700 D-mark, so about 1400 Euro.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
In August 1996, no one realized that the communicationator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything is different.
Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile part experienced an unexpected disaster, finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today the market is dominated by suppliers, who all came much later as Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, that is today for many people everyday life.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold, on Samsung and Apple alone 555 million.
The global sale of equipment is around €400 billion.
To this end, the well-established businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only early 2007, when Apple’s chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communication, everything easy to use via touch screen.
Apple’s winner has begun, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the supervision.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry had to fight.
The case now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-comprehension 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German is watching his phone 88 times a day.
“We all need to learn how to remove the smartphone,” said Janina Ballgel, responsible for staff at Siemens.
Permanent accessibility is now considered to be cursed and blessed at the same time.
England has to lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as we did in 2012 in London when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will create 10,000 new schools, 40,000 new jobs and end the youth unemployment in the airport.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think the challenge of Heathrow’s expansion is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame on the world scene.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow as well.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question he asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Extension is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion on awareness growth, and to leave a possession of skills and employment around the airport and throughout GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 – which was elected five years in consecutive to the world’s best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident Heathrow’s expansion will also be one.
It is time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, while ensuring our future trade and creating a possession of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Boards and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" about advertising blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, one of the software manufacturers says attempts to overcome advertising blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it reported that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on social networks again.
On Tuesday, Facebook reported that his desktop page would change the encoding regarding his ads to make it difficult to identify display blockings about which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams’ spokesman wrote that “this kind of Hin-and-Her-Battle between the displaying Open Source Community and the surroundings has already been in gang since the invention of display blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the struggle is a strong indicator of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.
According to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers worldwide; almost four times as many as 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile terminals, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company looked at advertisement blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile advertisement blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems to invest such a step as a reward.
Facebook announced on Tuesday that it would update its "advertising preference tool" to have more control over people's targeted advertising.
Facebook claimed on Thursday that Adblocks would be new filters worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
“This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in a message.
Ad blockers are a stunning means, so instead we have focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
Woman Suicide on Swiss Highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call witnesses after a woman was passed on a highway in the early morning of a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was overpowered by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died still on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police, who calls them and any witnesses of the incident, said.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to wait for one of the drivers to be shown.
Was a collision preventable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not being held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which one person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to leave that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper called.
Last year, a police officer was released from the tragic murder after she had passed a man who was on the A1 in August 2014 one night near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became conscious on the street, the court heard.
The court noted that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
The Venus was probably once inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA have developed a model to discover the past of the Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere could have shown ever similar conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turning of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, earthy atmosphere and yet slowly turned.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet appeared more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protect it from rapid deforestation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30% matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of Venus exhibits its daily side of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a rainscreen to uncover the surface from a large portion of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model highlighted a story of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planet researchers.
Although it was probably once inhabitable, the Venus -- over billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans diluted and their water steam was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen was removed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and led to too low co-determination right in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorados’ Alternative President/General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association would immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as headquarters and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched by the organization.
He must also have a right to co-determine decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who attended Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the League during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14.
He led the association to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota playoffs and missed the season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
Northern oil workers resumed talks, set up strike
Workfights on the wage for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all the dispute parties will stand at the table for a new round of negotiations, negotiating leaders said.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," a joint statement said.
We will hold a few full-day sessions in the coming weeks, which will begin the beginning of next year to address the problems.
The trade unions said their last strike, which was the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible salary cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group has reduced rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts gave the company the space needed to get through the decline in the market.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries as it rationalized its business as a result of its mega-conjunction with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was increased by the British’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish parliamentary Dave Anderson met workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measured the rotation rate of stars in the Plejaden Star Headquarters
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Plejaden's Star Headquarters.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the planet’s headquarters rotate to different rates and in which context the rotation periods are with the planet’s emergence.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age, and even the history of his solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Plejaden’s astronomical headquarters is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this asteroid, which were created about 125 million years ago, now reach adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
To top rotation rates, these mature stars explode large amounts of star wings.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a detectable star spot -- such as sun spots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower than smaller.
"In the ballet of the Plejaden, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star headquarters of Plejaden are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Plejaden star headquarters offer an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot before us that we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and thus hang on their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of Plejaden, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star goes off
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will last wear his New York Yankees trick against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
“I say goodbye to both,” explained the 14-time All-Star game participants of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player of the League, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has been granted to him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he acts as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and from 2005, he created some milestone.
With the Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the celebrity baseball hall.
Because Rodriguez was so successful on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
Already in 2009, the Superstar at "ESPN" allowed to have taken forbidden steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was shut down for 211 parties in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect to have received power-promoting agents for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the blockade was still reduced to 162 meetings.
“The league could have made me even a favor for 2014 because I have spent 20 years without pause,” Rodriguez said at the time.
His goodbye days also don’t go without noise.
While many baseball legends in their last games have again received the big stage, Rodriguez had to sit on the bank often.
"My job doesn't include a goodbye tour."
"My job involves the attempt to win each game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz, and was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans by Yankee erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at the 4:9 nide position against the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Obtained: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifters Adrian Zielinski should not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overrated by the first official doping cases.
A bad athlete would have won nearly a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, a 3000-meter obstacle swimmer Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifters Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - right before the start of any critically critical sports competitions, these news come to the moment.
At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already shown last Sunday, which was used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 meters of shatterling, while only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen had to participate in the precursors of more than 50 meters of freestyle.
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua cited in a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, IOC is no longer responsible, but CAS is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
In the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went to the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She is innocent, "the only statement could be dietary supplements," the body athlete said.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-Sample is already positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke to the athlete with criticism.
“I don’t understand why the athletes don’t make the right conclusions,” he said, “we are watching Bulgarians, so many have already been excluded.”
For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class of up to 85 kg was tested positively three days before his brother Tomasz tested on anabolic steroid nandrolone.
Both of them are opposed to the intake, but both should not start in the class of up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the body athletes, particularly the Danekowa case is another heavy strike for the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association of IAAF had banned the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic dopings, as well as the Kenya run produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the previous crimes in China also led to severe disputes between athletes.
This is how the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.
"The one who pinched the lila."
"When I see the podium more than 200 meters of free style, I want to give up," Lacourt said in French radio.
Sun was also the center of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping frauds,” he said.
Sun was tested positively on the stimulus of trimetazidine in 2014 in the Chinese championships, but had only one three-month block.
Data key: How perfide hackers press their redemption
Impression Malware programmers are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of Malware Anti-Professional Malware Bytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were at least once in the past 12 months, partly several times victims of an attack with erpresser software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were once targeted by a ransomware expression.
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the rescue funds required by the criminals to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The criminals specialize in their erpressing software according to the observations of Malwarebytes watching attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential relief is much higher than in private users.
"We are currently watching a terrifying rapid development of malware," Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski explains in conversation with the "World".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the offenders discovered the oppressive software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place terrifyingly quickly in the past few months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once active on a victim’s computer, it is targeted to search for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the original permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the erpressors.
To get the end encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where private users have the personal photo database in the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is silent.
Therefore, the damage falls higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of German companies reported sales losses by ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals have been victims of attacks several times, whose patients may be affected by the loss of medical records.
“We always tell the victims: don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying will receive their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to deny the demand of the offenders in the face of stopping in operation.
The hackers know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the pressors and found the result: The criminals actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, enroll or uncoding freely accessible support sites for example files.
And private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to refund their data unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware expression, hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
Programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software box to the actual printers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1,000 and 10,000.
"A customization tool is included, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.
The erpressors then seek further hackers to spread the recently purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in in one of the forums below, buy the set of a criminal and charge another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made by an infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then charge spammers with spreading," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company’s IT officials in the Malwarebytes survey rely on how to deviate Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Consequently, the criminals are already following new strategies.
“If encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful achievement, the offenders are threatening instead by publishing sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski said.
This makes the potential of damage even more likely than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, criminals could also take completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be quite a ransom for some victims.
If the offenders then block a whole manufacturing path in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little Coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds quite overloading, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be quite flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, passengers have much space in both the first row and in the fund, it does not work closely anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the top of the cockpit falls somewhat down there.
Very versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in storage space.
Not only is there a 453 l luggage room available for uplifted and 1026 l on clamped backs, but the "Magic Seats" are available.
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be lifted up like a cinema seat, thus providing storage from the ground to the ceiling of 1.24 m.
The luggage space can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the rotational momentum of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is delightful.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l petrol with 96 kW/130 PS.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The direction may be slightly more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the tested top version "Executive".
The safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant (working up to tempo 32), the collision warning system and the trackholding assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because it considers many obstacles when ranging as "continuing objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliable.
And the smart tempo controller responds to traffic sign recognition and threatens the speed when needed.
The full connectivity, however, is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sheets are under the arms sheet and are therefore somewhat compliant to reach.
The €29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel is all right.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from €20,000 and the diesel from €20,000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not responsible for: Sturz on passenger bridge
An airline is not responsible for the collapse of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because a liability can only be considered in the case of hazards typical for air traffic, the Oberlandes Court of Düsseldorf argued (e.g. 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knee plate at the collapse.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man damages.
Disease Case: When the organizer Pays
Diseased holidaymakers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
This is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family had severe diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of her Turkish vacation.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
Their disease led the holidaymakers back to a defective cleaning plant that allegedly had polluted the sea water.
The family was of the opinion that the journey had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
In the court, the complainants did not succeed.
Although the cleaning plant was actually defected.
However, the organizer learned about it shortly before the complaints left.
He had to assume that the sea water was okay until then.
He did not infringe his information obligations, according to the judgment.
In the water samples, no contaminants were found.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contaminating each other - is a general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must be conspiracy and willingly respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
Surely: Our country will not respond to the violence of the transgressors with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country faster, however, this increases security and also strengthens the approval of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag elections in 2017.
He also announced a further personal reinforcement of security forces, namely "in a medium-sized four-sized range over several years".
Mercy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is designed to improve the weapon rights to be novelized so that it is mostly difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The most discussed silence obligation for doctors is to be kept, according to the words of the Maizières.
However, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens in the dialogue with the physician, he said, with a view to psychological insights.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers it necessary to improve social care.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatic people.
In order to pursue crimes in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security.”
It is important that the Interior Minister clearly speaks against stockism.
"It was an earfight for the sharp makers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the radio media group newspapers (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of the completion was considered to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear Burka.
You can talk about rules, for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter proposed to the minister to simulate the power and ability of action with new anti-terror packages.
Left-Participant Bernd Riexinger said, "Flote proverbs and worsening of the right to stay will no longer bring security to the people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the highway transporter
It is regularly standing on the confusion street - here a picture of November.
However, this is to change: the lawsuit should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in the bus every evening when they drive through the highway (A 43).
Landsbetrieb Straßenbauning extends the legal abbreviation track by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure of Weseler Street on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Car drivers can then climb directly from the Hammer road to the right.
The big advantage: the traffic is split up early, improving the total flow on the multifunctional section of the federal road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the county represented Münster West.
The road relief on the transporter nerves the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 pm.
Workdays, the backstain is enough to reach the bridge through the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the nadelhorn on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler street.
From here, traffic is only purified through the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well three-quarters years ago.
The reason: static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary freight power to initiate, especially, heavy loads.
How long this engpass and the associated working day-to-day dust will last, the competent national operator cannot say.
However, it is expected with years: because the bridge has an official remaining consumer period by 2034.
For the prolongation of the legal reduction track, the country’s business has consciously chosen the weaker traffic time in school holidays because it has to be expected with disabilities.
Traffic will be carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday on a single basis at the construction site.
Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theater "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima’s Association allows youths with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Forest School Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the young theatre Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by Nima’s association, 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age visited the stage in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the Association, which has focused on the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes within the framework of this project, cultural institutions in Münster.
Most youths of the class came to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016, among other things from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreography, the scenic pictures and video animations, however, they could follow the history of action, according to the press release of the young theatre Münster.
The Nima’s association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming game period as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years of age will be able to visit professionally engaged courses in the fields of singing, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatre language mediation are in planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
Given the rising numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the stars in the southwest of Germany a strike through the bill on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suitable for watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rains, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the Starwart Welzheim, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather should be good, then we will certainly see a lot of stars in the sky.
The starshots are persecutors that are one of the fastest starshots with 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their names because they seem to come from the star image of Perseus, which emerges in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
Tonight, when you wake up for hours, you don’t think about sleeping in the morning.
That's all other than relaxing.
After all, with such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than unrelaxable.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they may be based on various causes, Hans-Günter Weeß, a board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand on the grounds is insomnia, i.e. an intrusion and sleep disorder.
Just sleeping many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Housekeeping Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Back there may be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also drugs.
Uncommon sleep disorder is an expression of a different disease.
"Very early awakening is mostly common in depression," Weeß says.
And it may be that several factors have been involved with each other.
For example, those who have a bandwidth accident may lie badly, awake every two to three hours and may begin to sweat about everyday problems and cares, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Whoever does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by day should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The disturbance may look quite different: you are tired, tired, unleashed, have difficulties with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical disorders such as stomach or headache.
To relieve sleep disorders, it is important to find out the causes of which.
Treatment options include behaviour changes, cognitive behaviour therapy or even medication - classic sleep pills only in exceptional cases and not more than two weeks.
In Germany there are little sleep medicines, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité University Medical Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact your home doctor in case of sleep problems, Weeß advises.
It can explain with research whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens there?
For example, medics are advised to investigate in the sleeping laboratory in snakes with breathing outbreaks, sick day fatigue, sleep converters, or if you do not find the cause of sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.
In fact, you don’t have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Please don’t just sleep in the afternoon,” says Bietze.
After selling the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, wear a nose glasses, a chest curve and a sensor on the finger.
Also, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can affected people deal with the problems?
There are a lot of screws on which you can use for a better sleep.
Weed counts: Regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not television to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you begin to expect immediately, and this is absolutely not favourable.
What does the jungle camp have to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first received gold at the short rail world championships in Doha, while presenting his first world record.
The former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now set himself to protect from his ex-team colleagues in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives a €20,000 prize and a jungle king should no one be surprised over missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
So we can’t compete with countries that promote a lot and don’t look so accurately at the topic of doping or even do it.
“I don’t say that checks should be stopped here,” he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly what we should do with countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by independent controllers of the WADA/FINA for a certain time before the WM/OS, must not participate," the hamburger, who currently operates an ice parts, claims.
Airport: Bands of luggage traffic arrested
Professional Thief at Düsseldorf Airport
The Dusseldorf police arrested two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
As a band, the suspects had committed several pockets and luggage holes.
At 21.30 p.m., civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to police from past thieves.
The two women and two men have committed several offences since mid-July of this year and have been community-friendly and especially professional.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves who were separately entering Germany to meet crimes.
In total, they had acquired over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few Linden trees, between the rest of the headstones: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work so at first glance, but the police are among the "Dangerous Places" of the city.
Walking along the road from the east to the west, you get to playgrounds, a freshly stretched child garden and a bioshop.
On the facade of a grey house, someone shouted "heavy!"
Against a Lidl, which will also be demolished soon, is already built: By 2017, there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments.
However, articles about this "three-country part", as the relevant real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: It was once occupied, for now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied and are used for events.
In particular, Berlin’s Inner Senator Henkel had repeatedly pronounced himself for a harsh action by the police against the project, called the area “No-Go Zone” for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been scattered with 300 police officers, the police patroled for three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, shut down parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the smoke had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers were dismissed under the joy of sympathizing and residents.
This summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the peak in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain form late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and children's gardens.
Left is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, is primarily generated by the presence of police.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concerns about increasing rentals and gentification.
It doesn’t sound like a kiez who mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave that the Berlin Innen Senator and the police open between homeowners and their neighbours do not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and its home projects have long been included in Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses in the former DDR were occupied, including nearly the entire Mainzer street near Riga.
While the Mainzers were under great police orders in a regular street strike, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are partly inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the city has become a magnet for tourists and electoral runners from all over the world: with them, DDR residents and former homeowners share their kiez.
This is also noticeable in rentals that have increased by nearly 60 percent in releasing since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on thrown discs or freshly deleted facades that have been thrown with color shirts.
No other street was mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence".
A reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively addressed to police officers.
Most of the crimes are caused by factual damages that tend to affect new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there is no question of uncertainty.
With regard to violence, she is confusing: the people of 94 are their neighbors, who certainly hadn't been that.
Even the famous burner cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the studyed architect, her street is not a criminal point of burning, but on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."
New builder consciously moved to Riga’s street - and remained.
That’s why it was so important for her that the residents got back their streets: from police, politics and the media, all of which in July suddenly claimed the descriptiveness of the city.
But in the eyes of residents like new-builders, the street will continue to be removed from them: through faceless new buildings in former buildings that deprive old-builders.
"These are finally property apartments that aren't interesting for many here - here are rather people who aren't so well-recognized," she says.
"Violence and destruction I can't approve."
But what should you do if you never listen to someone?
It involves frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents.
For those who are worried about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
Anyone who walks should be aware of it - just like someone who walks into a neighbourhood can complain badly about noise there.
All persons only presented with a surname have asked not to be named with their right name.
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the field of integration and organization.
She is also a social worker on-site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the management team for Achim Grockenberger.
She looks as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, workplace refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else are mixed.
Regine Customer from the working circle indicates that the honourable officials are more than grateful for Godchle is now there, the ovulating wolf milk sauce, which has, above all, a problem.
Thus, some - less embarrassing rather than targeting the variety of desired task areas - meant as the administration wanted to describe the office.
An administrative power was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in social work, just an eager wolf milk sauce.
But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.
It is primarily about organization, work with people on site and also behind the cults and network activity.
The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.
She has temporarily held a 50 percent rate for three years.
"It was the highest time," Regine Client says that Annika Deuschle supports honorable and main national actors.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be on the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
You need to house refugees in their own or rented residential rooms.
The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be charged by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility varies from the rural council to municipalities and job centers.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every tenant wants to offer its apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find any private apartments.
So far, it does not work by relying on private apartments, Allahchle.
Consequently, public apartments must be authorized as it is called beautiful.
So soon new containers will be placed on the washing street.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are practitioners, training sites, schools, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regine Client.
Many work at the building building or help homemasters, perform nonprofit work - and that is motivated and very well, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
This is "no employment therapy".
Activity does not mean only work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
Therefore, the administration and honour officers also come in here.
It is central that refugees feel that they are wished and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the procedure is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it takes just a while and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he can help no one in Urbach, must not work and is useless, he will never be integrated.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says Customer honestly, "People with whom nothing goes". Therefore, the work of Allahchle and Customer is always motivating others.
It's all a "mummy task."
A difficult question: Are they both afraid of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine says client clearly, "what some people call naive." A limit risk may be, but she doesn't want to exclude.
But the helpers are sensitive.
These incidents are also subject to refugees.
They were afraid that the assaults would bring them completely out.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with that,” says Regine Client.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, heads and honorary officials must keep an overview of activities in the region and in the area.
They are always in the background that a new attack on refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is scared.
In fact, it is unfair to put them in place.
“In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we can,” says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes clear that Urbachers are already loaded by integrating the people of the past reasonably.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in trouble, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
