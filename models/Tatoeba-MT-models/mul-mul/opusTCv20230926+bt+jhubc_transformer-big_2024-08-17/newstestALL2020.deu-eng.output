Fire was deleted in French Chemicals
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern France city of Rouen has been deleted. It shared the Normandy prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighter was in use with about 200 deleted vehicles.
The fire could be kept.
Anrainers were called for not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical factory on the shore of the Seines are manufactured additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is particularly subject to the so-called EU security.
In the factory, about 400 people worked. The chemical factory had already taken care of strike headlines - for example, when in 2013, through a leak, the gas methanthiol entwiched and the surroundings largely after faulty eggs smoked. In 2015, after an operational accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to search for her missing kid for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced extra for her job. Seven-year-old Border Collie had been withdrawn from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days was missing from the chicken any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrifying. I was bad," Carole King said to the "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband left a kid Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was missing. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had a dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says "She's gone approximately four hours and a half"," Carole King remembers against "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately out.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings were looking for their dear dog. But from days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a post employee to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"

Losses in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear unforgettable
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 are still missing.
In recent years, the federal army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots, including three machine guns. The remaining is in most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "threateful" scale.
At the Federal Army, weapons and ammunition have been lost again and again, many of them have lost 39 guns, 39 parts and nearly 20,000 guns. This is a list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which the German Redaction Network reports.
According to the paper from the office of the Defence Secretary of State Peter Tauber from the CDU, two guns, one part and 3474 shooting ammunition have been re-appeared. The remaining guns and guns are MG3, among other things, six machine guns of type MG3, 11 guns of type P3, 11 guns of type P3, 4 guns of type G3.
The extent of arms losses and munitions in the federal army was "threeding," said the left-wing deputy Martina Renner. This was more true because in the course of investigations it was hardly found again. The left-wing policymaker spoke of a "future balance". Renner also criticized the upper.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As refinitive ship observation data showed, the tanker was in motion and left the Iranian port. As a target port, Port Rashid was announced in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was already released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he first remained in the Iranian waters, which was called to wait for an official announcement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was imposed on 19 July by the Iranian revolutionary guards on the Hormuz Seaway under the allegation of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran reacted to the conflicting temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker before Gibraltar belonging to the UK.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have been enormously aggravated in the past months. The trade shipship has been made in the conflict between the United States and Iran. Dr.
Merkel respects the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the DDR who went to the street 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989, brave citizens had put the then DDR regime into disturbance, Merkel said at a firm act of Thüringer security CDU Group Stale Schensnerm the next day of the German unity in Erfurt.
Musk strives to deliver a record
The Teslas Quartal may keep records ready. Despite the delivery tree, there were last losses in the electric car company.
New York.Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong increase in record numbers at the stock exchange. "We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk’s roundwriting. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla must provide as many resources as possible to end the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strongly, the course has no longer applied for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered good 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. To do this, you have to produce six figures in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the low winnings. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't knit ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from grinding themselves. This is what scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday night, while progress has also been made in the question of why children are so severely grinding against the grinding to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the adjacentness of a knitted hand triggers laughter before touching, which lies on a deep knitted layer in the large brain, which already triggers the laughter while waiting for the knitted hand.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are tendered by humans. This "laughter" is transmitted by the part of the large brain, which serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-impression
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-tapping and touching by others - so people can't climb themselves. But now the researchers found that in experiments at the rats laughing as well as the activity of the relevant area of the great brain brain is suppressed during a self-tapping, while the brains are being climb themselves.
But passing self-contact and touching others at the same time, be also suppressed by the laughter. This suggests that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-contact and touching others. The new findings suggested that people can’t touch themselves actively because the self-contact is a big-contact.
The rats have also been trained to kidnapper themselves. Sometimes they break down this initiative in the experiment, showing escape behaviour or fear stars. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of the kidnapper is a behaviour reaction that is equal to rats and humans.
Disaster Released: Great Fire Deleted in French Chemicals
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern France city of Rouen has been deleted, which reported the Normandy prefecture of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, there should be no health-threatening substances. The samples taken do not give any reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. Nobody was injured in the incident. The firearms were in use with about 200 deleted vehicles.
Schools and children's gardens were closed
Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett
In the chemical factory on the shore of the Seine, the factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which requires particularly strict security requirements. About 400 people work in the factory.
In the past, the chemical factory already provided strike headlines - for example, when in 2013, through a leak, the gas methanthiol was deleted and the surroundings largely smoked after faulty eggs. In 2015, after an operational accident, about 2000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticizes his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in Parliament after the cancellation of forced pause on Wednesday night, but the Prime Minister threatened to lead the country out of the EU on October 31 without agreements, Brussels should not agree on its demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement, but it is unclear as he wants to achieve this.
Cox, who had committed himself to Britain’s remaining in the European Union, said: “The best way to honor Jo Cox’s memory and resuming this country would be to carry out the EU out of the country.” Cox was killed in 2016 during the referendum campaign by a right-wing extremist.
Attacks from Oslo and Utöya are uncovered
Over eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths will be revealed to honor the victims on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Iron Roses" (German: the iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron pink images. They remind the roses that had been laid down in Oslo in the days and weeks before the attacks.
At the same place, the project will now be disclosed by artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud - the roses have been smashed by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims, and are expected to be opened, among others, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
Right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first fired a car bomb in the government district of Oslo on July 22, 2011 and then at Utöya Island dozens of participants were shot at a holiday camp of the Youth Labour Organization of the Social Democratic Workers Party. Overall 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict, but now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could be stuck again in the lake. It could be a puzzle in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in the streets of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, according to Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now driving for medical examinations to Dubai, among other things, Erik Hånell, Reedereichef said. At noon the ship has left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he said to Swedish television broadcaster SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tankers on 19 July under the claim to have ignored the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were able to go well to work again in accordance with their circumstances, said Hånell.
The British government suspected behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero" a response to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: there was a super tanker of oil from Iran in early July that had been intended for Syria to be placed on the chain. The supply disrupted the authorities according to EU sanctions against the country of war Syria. The US was noted to the ship from the British
Iran spoke of "piratery" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. The courage, it had negotiated a exchange business to free the "Stena Impero", said London vehemently.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have been enormously worsened in the past months. Trade ship trips were brought into the conflict between the United States and Iran. Dr.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington there is a nuclear conflict between the two countries. The Americans are going to throw Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran shows it back. The United States went out in 2018 in a single way from the international nuclear agreement, which prevents Iran from building a nuclear bomb in the field, while at the same time striking pressures against Iran in the construction of a nuclear bomb, while ending the political and economic isolation in the US.
Due to the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of trade vessels in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the streets of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Caliation of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, along with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective forces, would ensure the safety of shipwreck in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestinated to "war winning". In view of the penal duties imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to rediscover. Biesu, financial leaders of Asian companies, who are considering the role of one, just considering a youth, making their production from China to another country.
But now India itself has been focused on Trump. From Haudegen in the White House, devaluing the "Kingdom of Customs", America has withdrawn the trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The United States of America has prohibited high tariffs and requires better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirit beds, and more motorcycles.
On the World War II map of the trade war, the raids with India are just a side-point. America also considers the world's largest democracy through security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's power claims in the southern Indian Ocean. In this context, a five-year security minister has a five-year security in India. In this background, a Salve of America's Penal Duties and two-year Prime Ministers are against India.
The problem, however, is another place: the empirically hardened theories that open markets accelerate economic development, have a severe state in the socialist republic of India. Also under Modi. His reform owner aims mainly at entering into the bureaucratic craftsmanship of the construction of energy, getting a lot of energy from the construction of the multi-populative state, getting a lot of profit and undertaking spirits.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics, much has improved in India in the first five years of modes. But in trade policy, this is not true. This means protecting internationally low competitive companies from foreign providers, even the new national conservative government built.
In the west, the Nimbus of the energy reformer is dependent on Partie, which economically radically renews its country. This impression is not ultimately due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows too well, which vocabulary of the western managers is the branch. In the core of the "India First" trade,the Jana's advocate becomes the leader of the country.
Posted by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to submit a report next week in Paris. The former head of state will be held at the Friedhof Montparnasse on Monday in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported, calling to the family Chiracs. The punishment will be held in the close family circle in Paris, publicly reported on a Sunday Sunday.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the body athletics championship
The world's top had been a long time in the target when it played heartwarming scenes in the down cool Khalifa International Stadion. In the first course of the men over 5000 metres, Jonathan Busby was dangerous to move from Aruba. However, he could close enough 300 metres from the target, but he could hardly stop the stamps at the end of his goal, stepped down to his legs.
"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the racing in Mixed Zone, when he had completely unexpectedly moved the attention of the assembled journalists to himself. Horrifying he had just been out, he couldn't even talk about his hero. Finally he couldn't start up his personal best time, but when he wasn't going to start up.
He did this in the evening with remarkable attention - and much more intense than he thought. Because this herotat will remain in memory. Especially Dabo left his competitor busby even the performance in the goal and volunteered to take the last place - by the way, about five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this precursor. Used by busby was just a lot of help in the end,
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, joined the Doha World Cup to set up a personal best time. However, according to official data, 18:10.87 minutes, he was disappointed: "I wanted to walk 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was once." However, only in training, there were no best time.
Million Masks: Egyptians Prepare For Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures were reinforced in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the Cairo centre, a police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had reinforced their street controls, and the phones of pedestrians were partially searching for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds of non-governmental organizations were arrested.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, however, it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura men came to protests with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and misconduct. A so open protest against the political leadership had been on Facebook. There was so open protest against the role of the political leadership it was in Egypt.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase by two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) accounted for more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, the government did not confirm these arrests.
Random arrests
Many people have been "detained" "just because they were "in the wrong time at the wrong place"," HRW reported, referring to lawyers arrested. The charges against the arrested range according to their lawyers, from "dispatching of fake information" to "univi forces" to the membership of a city in a "terrorist and other forms" in Alex, Kairoan.
HRW also criticized censorship in the northern African country, thus blocking Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online traders: Dealers will be able to donate tours easier
For online traders, many back-to-back packages are lost goods. About 20 million returns are landed on the waste. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando how they can donate back-end products instead of destroying them.
Although companies cannot be exempted from the sales tax on Sachs donations, the ministry said on a question of the Green-Bundes-Day Group, which the radio media group newspapers reported on Friday, but retailers could employ the market value of non-sales retreats so low that they should not pay any or less sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that federal citizens would return when ordering on the Internet each sixth package. About four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - landed then in waste. They would also cost companies in addition to the legal status, because the financial authorities assessed fact donations such as a revenue, then falls on the turnover.
Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt urged Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies cannot evaluate sales products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on the market but not to be punished for other spending. This was not only valid for online trading.
Banksy Art to Auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will be expanded soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the rebuilding of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the foundations characterized by animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be issued at Sotheby's in the British capital until it will be increased on October 3, it will be estimated to be EUR 1.5 to two million.
The work was first released in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - simultaneously with the original Brexit date on March 29. At this opportunity, the work, which formerly called the "Questions Hours" Parliament, was renamed in "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on Wednesday at the first session of the sub-chamber after the suspension of a suspended by Johnson, delivered by the Supreme Court a harsh sharp exchange with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit that has already been relocated twice on October 31, even without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover, Southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a mice. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit Debate Is Like a "Passion Walk in the Park"
The harsh verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament does not contribute to a hate climate. In comparison with the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "painting in the park," Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this.
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in parliament over the past few days and argued against them, among other things, "betrayal" to the people, accusing him of putting the deputies in danger because they could be targeted by murder threats, he said.
Cummings said that the only way to rest is if the Members would finally respect the decision of the British to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that people have been involved in the fact that the UK has not yet left the EU for three years after the referendum.
In view of the uploaded mood, even bishops of the Anglican Church called for resignation on Friday. "We should talk with each other with respect," he said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at its first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General debate in New York. "If the bad thing is going on, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst," the United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate a part of Kashmir, another part belonged to China. In early August, India of the Indian Kashmir region had removed the autonomy status and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo demand the collapse of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with harsh hands. It allows the population to shoot with sharp ammunition, more than 2,000 detained relocated into prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who have already settled there. Protests have never been dangerous in Egypt. But from the early overtake of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Arabs are doing everything for it in 2013
But one of the launchers of the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, prospectiveness, and the feeling of being driven by the government by millions were driven to the streets. And that is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi is also not able to deal with, no matter how hard it is going to face opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today every third person lives in Egypt under the poverty limit. Since 2016, if the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent then. Those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket have to decide who they already funded: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the soldier property. Latter is not only a leather houses for the oppression, but also a leather market.
Twelve tests at the terminal: BER Head: No showstops for the main airport
Two months ago, it has been checked whether the complex facility is working in collaboration with BER brand protection. The operators are satisfied with the course, but the TB is not yet finished at BER.
Following extensive Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is sure, said the supervisory board chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the supervisory board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said there are still defects in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real show stoper." He assured that the schedule included still buffers until the start.
However, there are evidence that the time reserve will no longer be too large. The construction project will now be submitted at the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was intended for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in electrical cables are still to be solved; the TUV wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the inclusion of the airline here, we need to continue to work intensively to address the deficiencies," a written statement said.
Lutke Daldrup said, in many cases, it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dubles on which the cable routes hang. The airport chief expects that this will be present by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection during the transition to the station under the terminal has not yet been satisfied. The problems have already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking screws that fall down with a fire like a leather wall so that smoke does not spread. They try to run too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced with the start of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further construction deficiencies, as well as planning errors, have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should go into operation in 2011. Costs are expected to rise from two billion since the beginning of 2006 to around 6.5 billion euros for opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly, the operators are planning the expansion of the airport, which is why it should be held at a special meeting of the supervisory board on October 18, as the chairman of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Finance chief Heike Fölster is moving to German train at the end of the year, staff chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen is going to retire next year, as Bretschneider said. Thanks to Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automates for drugs scratched - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and hunted some machines in Chemnitzer City Area for that! Now the criminal is finally in jail!
In the last two years, the number of smoked cigarettes and parking lots in Chemnitz and the region has increased strongly, and a million injuries have occurred!
After two detonations in late May, the police captured a 33-year-old German in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations due to the conduct of explosive explosions in fact with a particularly severe case of the thief conducted by the Chemniers Criminal Police, not only confirmed this suspicion against the 33-year-old."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now held a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the Beute, he has apparently funded his dependence on the conquest." Only four times the bomber had shot parking machines on the road between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage resulted from at least 60,000 euros!
The automation bomber is now in custody, and the police investigations against him continue.
It is believed that he was also responsible for further automation strikes in Chemnitz and adjacent land circles.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the pricing fight with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary of AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines confirmed on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa Billing Flight Eurowings will be de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. The AUA takes over in the "Wetlease" from January 2020, including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, Germany will be stationed over three Eurowings destinations in the future.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA cruise and network planning, the spokesman said. The flight times are to be adjusted to connecting flights, aiming on the one hand to strengthen the Vienna cruise and expand the decentralized traffic from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna will only be a "Production Company" for the company's sisters AUA. In particular, Barcelona and Rome will be used with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device.
At the airport of Vienna, Niki-Pleite, a prize race broke out. Ryanair’s daughter Laudamotion announced on Thursday that the fleet would rise to 16 planes in Vienna the next summer. The Irish cheap plane sends four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease" contract.
Ryanair’s chief Michael O’Leary’s fighting statement that Lauda will be overcome by the AUA in five years, responded on Friday to the AUA board Andreas Otto: “We will stay number one in the location, in five, six or ten years.”
Princess Beatrice is Married
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: When children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of four is married. Beatrice is married!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the early months of the Italian holidays, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) has stopped his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), which the palace announced on Thursday.
"We are very pleased to announce our weddings. We both look forward to starting this adventure together and we can hardly expect to be really married," the couple, according to British media reports, said in the official statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years of love and happiness.”

However, it is certain that the breakdown of the number nine of the British throne row and the real estate mogul will become a similar big festival as Eugenie's marriage on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really solves a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburger researchers now want to look at the legacy of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people, hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular disease in detail.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-language area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with € 12.5 million. From Switzerland, the high-speaking Davos clinic belongs to the Foundation and the University Hospital Zurich participates.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are one of the key influential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. The interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it was the center of comparison. Now scientists want the full inheritance of the universe of 8000 healthy people with the previous 1000.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are known from the clinic.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as the care, detection and treatment of heart failure, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other folk diseases, such as Stefan Blankenberg, leader of the university’s heart and vessels, as well as Neuerbrank to play on heart and vessels.
Klaus-Michael Kühne (82) also stressed that it gives the strong will to use the data also for the exploration of other diseases. The Davos Foundation Clinic has been treated mostly for years. Now Switzerland should be open to a heart on its medical campus, then open up a center for cardiovascular precision, and three of its members will be born in Engabars for a very good life.
The bio samples of healthy participants come from hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study".

The first results are expected in the year afterwards.
Nigerian police release hundreds of misconducted boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Coran school. According to reports by residents, security forces searched the school in the North Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims of minors, as police spokesman Jacobu Sabo reported. "The victims were being treated abusively. Some of them said Sabo, adding to their teaching.
The boys were arrested under the pretext of being taught in the Qur’an and “improved”; in fact, the defenders were arrested by their teachers under “the most decent and inhuman conditions,” Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were labeled in a small space.
The Qur’an school was founded for about ten years. The residents had been aware of repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents had been shocked when they were informed of the state of the Qur’an school, Sabo said. They hadn’t heard of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested.
In mostly Muslim northern Nigeria, there are many private coran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the UN refugee asylum service, more than 40,000 people fled across the border in the neighboring state of Nigeria in the past ten months.
Nigerian police releases 400 children from school
Police have released nearly 400 students in a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were alarmed and some had visible injuries that indicated torture," police spokesman Jacobu Sabo said in Kaduna.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a statement in an Islamic school. The conditions were "inhuman" there. The officials took the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school as slaves and placed on chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed demagnized and injured students in a perceived poor health condition.
World Football Championship: More charges after Messis and Klopps Kur
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association scores the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honour and thereby record.
After Nicaragua's captain said he had never voted at the World Football Elections, charges from other countries came to the FIFA. Egypt was not assessed at all - with a curious reasoning.
In recent years, the FIFA has proved to be a remarkable: the World Cup, the ambitious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials, but the FIFA world footballer's election has not yet been objectively held in suspicion, then unclearly runs nationally, and members of the country voted unclearly.
But after he had already complained to Nicaragua's captain, he had not voted at all, there are still further unjustities: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account; in fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible vote overview.
The FIFA apologises so far as "the signatures were issued to the election forms in large letters and therefore not valid" and have contacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan coach is also surprised
There is also a call from Sudan on the choice. While the case can be realized in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi on place one, with Virgil van Dijk on two and with Sadio Mané on three. However, according to Fifa and Steenso, the vote was precisely voted.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also said: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 awards. All the information on my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguaan football association just voted on his behalf.
From the association now came the message on Friday: voted, but it was of course not intentional. The full of election documents were "irrationally" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, but it would have been provided, in a statement of the association, it was also called Rosagan in a statement, but in fact it was called the second man of the association.
The other cases now allow the Fifa to examine in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers advisory firm, while Lionel Messi remains the uncontroversed winner of the World Football Election – and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the year.
Ukrainian affairs: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation of
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly pronounced for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this can lead to operation from here, is determined by the facts that the president is determined.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic Presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump observed Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affair, only few have shown that it is uncomfortable. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly turned against Trump’s policy, e.g. contravention of locking and environmental regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation. "It's a deeply disrupting situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, as governor of U.S. states, have formally not discussed in the process against Trump, on which it is decided in Congress. Therefore, their statements are mostly symbolic. However, the first senators of Republicans have also critically expressed themselves over the situation. For example, with Romney, who is disrupting the state of Utah, interrespectively acting on the second Chamber, said
The affair could be initiated in the opening of an official withdrawal procedure against Trump, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, and they will offer him power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the cancellation procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. The decision on an actual cancellation fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are low. So far, an impeachment of the U.S.
Was it a torturer on the board of Rackets "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they have been raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unlawfully driven the port of Lampedusa on board with the rescue vessel "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees. Following harsh protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - she was arrested again after a few days of Italian arrest.
Now new heavy charges against rackets are being made. Thus, three men who are being tortured in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been caught in a recording camp in Messina (Sicilia) but press have not closed their peninsulas themselves, after the immigrants were not able to renounce information in Italy.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, beaten and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematicly scattered, and the victims were repeated in mid-african.
NGOs and aid organizations now suggest that they can't know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," said new builder. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. Therefore it is quite likely that there are also criminals on the ships. "It is therefore very important to go after that.
Italy's former foreign minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology for rackets against which is still identified for aid to illegal immigration in Italy.
Musk seeks to deliver records at Tesla
Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book up 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk’s roundwriting. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla must provide as many resources as possible to end the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strongly, the course has no longer applied for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95,000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars. To do this, you have to produce six figures in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the low winnings. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Just a bridge funding resumed
The new financial year will be started in the United States on October 1, without a regular budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided a transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase in expenditure limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021 in August, the United States is still there before the new fiscal year of expenditure starting on October 1 again without expenditure plans. The Senate has to follow a strong decision on Thursday to the President's decision would be on Monday.CR has concluded a decision on Monday to the President's decision.
Shutdown Reversed
Provisionally, the federal administration is now financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the end of Monday fiscal year 2019. This is because Congress has not been able to reach the 12 expenditure laws in time, some which are able to allocate the resources to the various departments and authorities of the bio-department. The federal administration can not benefit from the first year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats who have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans, and the Senate also has ten of the twelve expenditure plans more or less prepared, which are barely majority.
The spirits divide themselves mainly on the issue of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the great priorities of President Trump. The Democrats were disturbed by the wall building plans and their financing in 2018 was a 35-down conflict, which was actually for other military buildings and projects.
In the wall building, the spirits separate
Currently it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all 12 expenditure laws over the coming seven weeks is an extension of the transitional funding over November 21, and therefore a shutdown is not excluded.
In the context of the ongoing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time, and the risk associated with the shutdown gains ideas to automate the process in popularity. Subject S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically lead the funding of the federal administration to the level of the previous year.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertility will also be open to single women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority for a bill of government, which allows all women to use an in-vitro fertility, so that the demand for anonymous seed donations could significantly increase.
The present requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without father" could grow in the future. Also the French bishops' conference is opposed to innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethic legislation defenced by Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It constitutes the modern family in which it gives children with only one parent or homosexual parents. According to their idea, the costs of artificial fertility for all women are to be charged by social insurance.
Fertility with sperm by dead husband is further prohibited
With a short majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that should give widow access to the sperm of her dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, then the artificial fertility "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany, a severe death in the past, a strike was given in the case of Paris, in which the women were dismissed in the release of the sperm.
On the contrary, numerous Members of the La République en Marche (Republic in Movement) by President Emmanuel Macron and opposition Members of the Opposition had expressed themselves for artificial fertility with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a widow will be raised a "double sadness" if the death of her husband is still injured.
The initiators of the now missed amendment believe that it is unfair that a widow may be fertile in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with the of her own partner.
So far, the artificial fertility in France is only allowed by heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that hire maternity remains prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertility is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Compensation for climate: calls for flight tax for Unis will become more loud
There will be a lot of flying to colleges. That's why the country will also make a climate tax there in the future. Rectors say they don't have any money for it, but now they are also under pressure.
High schools should also be limited to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
The debate on climate payments on flights from universities and colleges is still in Schwung. After the country’s director’s conference had responded skeptically to a corresponding prejudice from the green-black coalition, the plans are now needed support from high-level flights from high-level colleges. In a common statement, the doctors are incurred in high-levels and high-levels.
Russia re-releases North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the arrested were illegally captured in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a shooting exchange between the border guards and the ship's crew. Three Russians were injured, but a North Korean was not injured, the fishermen later reported severe injuries.
The Communist North Korea suffers from a chronic lack of food, and the North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters, where the coastal guards of Russia, according to their own information, conduct their sea-biological patrols.
30,000 ink fish captured
In addition, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and captured on the boats, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were captured and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
Russia's fisheries authorities had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year, according to complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested this year, according to media.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained also of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-masking synthetic networks prohibited in Russia. These would also have been brought out of the sea for years. In addition, small living creatures would be deployed in the sea.
In the future, only 18,000 more: U.S. reduces asylum surgeries
The “greatest nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The world's richest country is shooting off against defendants: as confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the upper limit for the legal addition of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, mostly threatened believers and Iraqi asylum will be obtained.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for recruitment of new refugees again. In the financial year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be left to the country, as the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said. In the nearly ended financial year, the limit is 30,000 people still.
President Donald Trump’s government has drastically reduced the recruitment of refugees from all over the world in recent years, and under Barack Obama’s pre-government, it had made much higher recruitment limits.
The upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. However, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs described the U.S. as "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a formula that strongly reminds the U.S. official president's language use.
A "responsibly conscious deal" with refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them there, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of reluctance from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A big point of dispute is the border to Mexico that Trump wants to close. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed national emergency. Whether there is a timely link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the U.S. capital, it is unclear. Trump is currently standing under pressure due to the Selenskyi process.
The U.S. government will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are threatened by this, as it is stated in the Foreign Ministry’s declaration.
The U.S. wants to achieve that particularly people from this "northern triangle" Central America apply for asylum in other countries; in this context, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to stop immigration at the U.S. Southern border to Mexico.
The court orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
A Orang-Utan woman was moved from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires to a trap station for human assaults in the United States. The "Sandra" born in the Rostocker Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a "non-human person" but was therefore imposed as a "non-human" flight, which is why Gilt is forced to release Anagi.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human beef are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, it will be expected to live in the Florida Center for Great Apes in the future. There are already 21 more orange utans and 31 chimpanzees, including "Bubbles", formerly Popstar Michael Jackson's pets.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zo in Gelsenkirchen before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of the main rights of animal protections has contributed to the conversion of the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, there will be an area of research.
Record for Swiss Extremberg Steiger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountainist Dani Arnold is happy with a new house ride in the Italian Alps on the nearly 3,000 meters high large Zinne.
Without networks, double floors or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Arnold, dressed with jeans, T-shirt and supported only by absolute swivel freedom, took 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise.
Arnold is now record holder of the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important northern walls in Europe.
Nike benefits from a new online marketing strategy
Regardless of the trade conflict with China, U.S. sporting item manufacturer Nike has booked a significant profit-plus. Net profit has increased to $1.4 billion in the last quarter (about $1.3 billion). This is 25% more than in the previous year, as the company reported on Tuesday.
The sales increased to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. The strongest numbers of Nike sales increased with a plus of 22 percent in China, so that the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to accessing the Internet or smartphone apps directly to consumers.
Financial chief Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sporting item manufacturer with strategic investments, thus expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were happy to respond to the quarterly numbers - the stocks of the sporting item manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Due to racist comments on soccer professional Juan Jesus of AS Rom, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The defence officer Jesus from Brazil has been accused of the fan on Instagram. Then Jesus has published the private news of Rome and has called on his fan binism to take such action with the club.
The association responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police, and Roma fans should never visit the association again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly, Italian fans scan racist races against black players competing teams. "We can not have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the managers and throw them away from the stages of the Sun. Fifa-President Infanini said the first day of the season.
However, the supporters of Juventus Turin had been discussed lately. The Italian authorities have now demonstrated 38 random fans of record master Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are likely to no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, police reported. The rest of these bans apply for up to four years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups around Juventus, including heavy pressure, money laundering and private violence. The club had put the investigations into role with an announcement last year.
The ultra-leaders are supposed to stick behind the black trade with tickets. They have "military-controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and have pushed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - all the years are considered with striking names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. How well do these labels describe the respective feeling of life of young people?
"The Krabs Come!" This reputation began on September 21, the Krabs capture at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also launched the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, according to the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee Department of Public Work.
Gaochun, which forms the southern excavator of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China, and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has natural conditions in environmental terms. The city is natural with its ideal conditions, with a mixture of waters around 30% and the surroundings.
The people in Gaochun have already begun to grow crops in the early 1990s. Over time, the crop industry has developed to become a prominent industry that has provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively grown to promote the city's growth for a large, ecological and scientific development of the crop.
In recent years, Gaochun has introduced a reform for "distribution of power, optimization of administration and of government services" and has carefully built the service network for "permissions under a roof, a team for legal enforcement, a network for services, a platform for credit delivery". This means that the city wants to optimize the environment for authorisations, services and development.
Gaochun gains the advantages given on site by connecting culture to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui land land land landlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandlandland
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer of abolition of sanctions from the U.S. after returning from the UN General Assembly. The United States had put an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Twitter: “I wanted Iran to cancel the sanctions imposed against him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani pictures this: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had urged a meeting to take place. "And America says I have lifted the sanctions," added Ruhani.
However, if this offense does not take place in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticized. Given the current criminal measures and the "toxic atmosphere of maximum pressure" no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York City. In the background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to stop the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron had like Merkel at the edge of the UN Assembly DonaldPree hoped that Ruhani is expressed with US
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200
After the west of Turkey was shot by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people have been injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Almost 200 have been injured since the beetle on Friday, Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The earthquake of the strength 5.8 had shocked the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the Million Metropole. Now the government wants to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquake in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared to beat, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential houses fall - including worms made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shatter Istanbul.
City planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici have been warned for years that large open areas, which have been registered as refugees in the center, have long been built. Until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Bebens in August, the building engineering chamber of Istanbul had warned that one million buildings in Istanbul were estimated to be not ground-safe.
The epicenter of the Bebe from Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection agency Afad reported. A smaller devastation took place a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu reported on Twitter that injured or damage was not reported at first. The state transmitter TRT showed people who ran out of panic from homes. Students were brought from the buildings for safety reasons in Silivri district. Some students were crying as they were seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered a particularly dangerous earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasical and Anatolic Earthquake. Turkey is repeatedly shot by earthquake. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people came.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of the strength of 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when the earthquake comes, it is unclear. At the earthquake on Thursday, the west of the country and Istanbul were again encountered.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed Go-Bags with all the needs ready to stand next to home doors, and schools help children behave how they have to be when the earth crashes. When the next big beam comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered mild damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul catastrophe coordination center (Akom). According to the report, two Sariyelar minarets of Avrkenci in Bezi.
Warning for rainfall in Istanbul
In social networks, many users report panic. Buildings crashed. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was harder than that of Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, had warned via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings.
According to official data, the date of the beating is indicated at 13.59 (local time) and only a few minutes after the first beating, a beating was indicated at a strength of 4.0 on the judge's scale, according to CNN Turkey.
Only on Tuesday had a earthquake of strength 4.6 shocked the Turkish marmara region - it was felt to Istanbul, and its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the Million Metropole, the Afad disaster protection agency reported on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that took place on Tuesday: Pakistan was also affected by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a disastrous earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will sometime get rid of it - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. This has become more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy said to the transmitter. "Early or later, the big earthquake will also come".
A few weeks ago there had been an accident - the beef solved great concerns in Istanbul, and in Albania there had been a massive earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Even in the lake of the ground this year the earth had been earthquake.
Parliament: New Fuel in Ukraine affairs
Two brilliant documents provide for new fuel in the Ukraine affair for possible power abuse by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible cancellation procedure, the US Democrats are confirmed: The Trump’s self-deserved complaint of an anonymous notebook once made his self-love.
USA: United Airlines passenger closed in toilet - Flights redirected
Because a passenger had been locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines was redirected. The toilet door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the 1554 flight, the airline reported.
At an exceptional intersection on Wednesday night in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the close cabin. Around an hour after she had been locked in it, the US media wrote, calling other passengers. To move towards San Francisco, passengers had to switch the plane.
In an online video that is intended to come from U.S. media from flight 1554, it is to see how many people try to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door. We're getting you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline has apologised to all passengers. Opening was initially a woman issuing.
The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan Writing Brexit Romans
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unrecognized.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas’ famous story “The Transformation” British successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear on 27 November in German, the Diogenes Publisher (Zürich) reported. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who has not been ignored or hated in his previous life, but now is the most powerful man of the UK to take care of his mission.
McEwan was quoted by the words: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government can't be challenged in a critical moment, if the ministers unshamedly lie as once the Soviet leaders, if Brexiteers in high positions have the disaster of a no-deal just just to ask - then a writer has to ask about it early in the year.
The first story published in Kafkas in 1915 is by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees "to an unexpected inconvenience" and is sometimes excluded from family and society and eventually defeated. "Ian McEwan denies Kafka to describe a world that stands on the head."
EU invests €9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive flea brakes to reduce noise loss by freight trains, and sections of the train connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernized and electrified.
This will make travels more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to the EU officials, and the funds come from the EU infrastructure top "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips are cancelled until October 31.
German travel agent Thomas Cook canceled all trips until 31 October 2019, including 31 October 2019. Travels could not be accessed for insolvency reasons,” the company said on Thursday night.
These include bookings of Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, booker travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As for travels starting on November 1, 2019, the company left open. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, it will continue
Thomas Cook, in Germany, was a member of the UK's mother-in-country board and had filed an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, employs approximately 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to return money to hotels immediately
However, from this Friday, hotels abroad, currently hosting Thomas Cookers, are expected to receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer invited to extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the presentation of separate bills, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50% of the outstanding payments, as a spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels are not promptly asked for individual payments of hotel charges," or to be reimbursed.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodation on site themselves according to their own data, some of which had to put more than €1000 on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had strongly criticized this.
How many hotels are affected, the insolvent travel provider will be voted on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, there were still 70,000 Thomas Cook pauschal leaves from Germany. Zurich Germany has a vacation and return from Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the payments announced to hotels by Zurich Insurance are only helping travellers who are currently on their way. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. Late Thursday night the company reported that all travels would be cancelled, including October 31st. This also applies to such bookings that are already paid.
As for travels starting on November 1, 2019, the company left open. In conjunction with the insolvency insurance, the further method will be reviewed, it said. Basicly, the insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insured Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could be informed on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosions in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues Lady Diana's commitment, now he walks directly on his mother's traces in Africa.
With a blue splitter protective vest, British Prince Harry has fired and destroyed an explosion in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts in the Dirico site, he set the flame circle on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosive bodies exploded in the Savannah landscape without harm. Although alone the Halo Trust population has more than 100 000 relics of the country's decades ago, there's still more bloody conflict in Africa
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly on the traces of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to regain the way she then went. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious mining field in 1997 were demonstrated to the world. Also she had gone for support.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which has started in the South African tourist metropolitan capital.
Brexit negotiations: The danger of a non-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly established himself: With him there will be no third suspension of Brexit negotiations guaranteed. But what statements are in polarization of the British already for eternal duration. Anyway, the latest judgment of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom had been resumed on this issue again as an annullation of the case in the UK, as an annullation of the case in the European Parliament.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass significantly to Johnson. In the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he made statements that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of an end of October:
You know, we're going to keep the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal, I am cautious that this can be done.
And the time runs the Brexit dealers in Brussels gradually. Yet about six weeks, the EU and the British dealers could have time to prevent Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union without agreements. But even the recent talks have never again been afraid of any breakdown of a Brexit No state of power. An agreement of the Brexit deal until the end of October appears to be an outbreak of the law.
U.S. officials: More deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to 12. In addition, 805 confirmed and likely injured in this regard, the U.S. Health Authority reported CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 users reported in the U.S.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times Mohammed Ali's videos were divided into online networks. The builder and actor living in Spain calls for a "volks revolution". For today's Friday, he called on further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian country's military, whose critics have been committed to corruption and misconduct. Alion
At least the security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Kairos there was already an increased police presence to be observed. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their street controls and the cell phones of pedestrians were partially linked with news and photos.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. According to the security forces have responded hard. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), claims have been arrested almost 2,000 people since last week. Laws have been arrested under laws. Many of them have been detained by HRW only because they have been detained in the place.
The organization also criticized censorship in the northern African country. The government then blocks Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general ruled the country since 2013 after falling down the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents and activists have been condemned in past years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition Back
Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, among other things by Skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of the earth warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, the Polar Researcher said. He has waited for years for the young generation to be reported as word. For decades, it is known that the Earth is warming up. However, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What is happening on the sea is often happening outside the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of the earth heating and sea melting. The expedition was measured, among other things, with a drone of Greenland glacier ice and fished with networks of microplastics.
For his "Fight for Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Sea" the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us, the survival of the oceans is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann in the last year's awarding.
Dear Spaghetti in Rome: Tourist women pay for 430 Euros
430 euros for two tablespoons spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: it seemed too much for two Japanese tourists, although the invoice of 80 euros was paid by the two women, but they posted the quittion on Facebook, which caused hot reactions.
"These cases harm the view of Rome. We call on the police to examine the question of whether this is a fraud," a spokesman of Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, said in the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant soon came. Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also a drink money of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the host said.
U.S. President Donald Trump, after the turbulent revelations of the last days, could actually face an official withdrawal procedure, which Democrats want to check this as soon as possible with their investigation into the House of Representatives - the speech is from weeks to a decision.
At the beginning of the scandal, it is likely that the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The claim of the Whistleblower, who has made the conversation actively concerned about national security and US democracy with his complaints, has finally turned to the public, is monstrous: the President is in 2020 giving the power of his office to abstainably abstain from the power of the country to abstain from the government of another country.
The core of this project is also included in the now published statement of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not give back the full text. The telephone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much bigger story, in which the center is next to Trump, especially his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes out of public view in May 2019 its beginning when the New York Times could report plans by Rudy Giulianis to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the just elected President Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very accurately that his information is illegally weak to become a government. "We're not going to be very weak for the government. We're going to be a very weak for the election.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have been infected with the right conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump's opponent candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to build an occasion for Russia's investigations in the United States.
It is about the exact investigations that Trump will talk about on the phone with Selenskyj in July so prominent. The version of Giulianis and the president is: the former Vice-President Biden and the present-day candidate for the presidential nomination of the Democrats was arrested by Hunrup, his son was arrested by Ukraine, Joe Biden was arrested by the Opposition of the Opposition of the Democrats.
In fact, the course was a bit different. When Joe Biden demanded, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General to go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected by it. Chokin was also even even deeply corrupted gears claim against the company. The U.S. government was defeating Obama, defeating the only west partner.
Disorders on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, mainly Germany, Britain and Spain have affected. On the website all disturbances.de users report that Facebook hasn't loaded again for about 15.30 pm. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also appears to be affected by disturbance, even though it hasn't been around.
Instagram and Co. more frequently affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive disturbance in this year. It was already in March and July that the services had fallen for several hours. And, as in previous cases, users, especially this time, come back to Twitter to make their trouble.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on the way with a sliding boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in disaster - less than an hour the Chilean rescue crawler took for the mining.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
“At 9:30 we received the message that just 10 years ago we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the sliding boat.”
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 at Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were certainly brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone NIE Wireless Charging
Practical, but harmful
Induction technique via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have just arrived on the market, supporting wireless charging and selling themselves very well - the new iPhone-11 models are all the best, we would like to bring back a study from early July. Although the wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds the battery
Researchers warn from the wireless charging of smartphones. This is extremely harmful to the devices according to the findings of the university of Warwick. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you charge a phone normal by cable, the battery warms up at a height of power in three hours to 27 degrees. When the wireless charging, the researchers also lifted up at a height of 30 degrees.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor for the durability of the battery. Each degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery is not only charged to capacity, but also keeps it as long as it is. Therefore, the lifespan for the iPhone is less expensive. The researcher rates therefore is too high for the smartphone by cable.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply putting the device on a suitable charging pad - these are currently already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a challenging cable salad and soft plug-in smoke. Since technology is used with Qi (inductive energy transfer) the technology is used in the case of Apple, it is even a standard of the world.
Everest Stau Photographer: 13 Eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese hill rider has held 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer reported.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14,000 people in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international titles: From him comes a photo of a viral spring-going mountain climbings standing on Mount Everest.
The picture of the mass rank resolved a debate on stronger security measures at the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest top of the earth, and 11 climbings died in the climbing within a few days in May.
A problem for Purja could be the resignation of the 14th thousand: Currently, Chinese authorities block the Xixabangma Bay in Tibet. A reason for this is called, among other things, bad weather. Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants found in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a bearable elephant cake, a police spokesman told Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four corpses were found in a protective area near the famous and visited by many tourists earlier rocky fortress Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The farmers are often farmers in their country who had previously kept the animals intact. At the same time, about 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This usually happens when animals drag through villages constructed near their living room.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka, which is theoretically the death penalty.
British oil tankers leave Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city Bandar Abbas for more than two months after Iran's settlement. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas seafarer agency according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian revolutionary guards had set the tanker running under British flag on July 19 under the claim that the regulations of sea law had failed in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook’s Management in Criticism
The competent economic committee of the sub-house wants to examine the area of travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive manner. In this case, it should go about the salary packages of the board as well as the question why the British government did not like to contribute financially to the survival company. "Our interest in management is a London example. "Our interest in the company is valid as well as control in the company.
According to experts, genes are overestimated at intestinal cancer risk
The role of genes in the family increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion of researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are likely to weigh more severe than previously assumed. This has highlighted the consequences of individual calculations.
Elon Musk Leads to Increase Tesla Stocks
This was written by Musk in an e-mail published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees. The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, according to Musk's newspaper.
The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer, and Tesla needs to provide as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strongly, the course has no longer applied for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had shipped about 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. To do this, you have to produce six figures in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the low winnings. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will the British government avoid Brexit law? Johnson refrained
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned whether he is looking for the possibilities of a breakdown of the last parliamentary law against an irregular Brexit. On a question he just said before journalists on Friday, his government will keep its current law.
The law stipulates that the government should apply for a relocation of the deadline by mid-October should not be reached by any agreement with the EU. Johnson criticizes this as a "capital law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political scams" to overcome the law. Johnson could use a procedure trick that would move the law into force to the time after the EU’s withdrawal.
Johnson said he seeks a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way with an agreement is that."
Iran is going to enrich uranium
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contracting partners in the fight about the rescue of the historical nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European States show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference in 2015, he denounced the step of the UN General Assembly in New York.
The conflict is the background of the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which in turn contained the commitment to normalize economic relations in Tehran. The United States rose out of the agreement in 2018 in a single entry to force Iran with "maximum pressure" on the basis of a trade in Teheran's Teheran's return to an exchange of courses in Iran's deemed aggressively treated by the President Donald Trump's
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared centrifuges installed in early September with uranium. According to IAEA, Iran is preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of pressureful U.S. sanctions, but there will still be further talks that hopefully need a solution.
Rohani continues to challenge Iran’s attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the Communist Party changed: Germany, France and Britain followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported in Yemen had nothing to say about the attack.
"Those who claim such accusations have to make evidence of it," said Rohani. However, the European leaders would not have been able to talk with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have appealed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out such an attack. President Borronu France, Rohani had made it in the past days.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the U.S. administration must be repealed first, Rohani urged the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialog and reasoning".
Comet from another star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of the universe, which has only been achieved once before. The comet allows conclusions to other solar systems.
What was initially only one assumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crossed by our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized on 2I/Borisov after his discovery and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The vastest comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with an auto-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Surveillance of various observations not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen in a passage of our solar system after 1I/Oumuamua of 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights from close to a foreign solar system before it decomposes on nimmer view. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system typical, as the astrophysics of the objects reported, as the astrosphere agency reported about 15 of the astrosphere of the Canary Institute, "the current speed of this comet is .
The comet has been analyzed on a so-called hyperbelline that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the name and categorization of the heavenly bodies, which was the first name of the object from which our first name of the heavenly bodies was of the year 2019.
Astronomers have luck: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the attack. So the researchers will remain for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then see it by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will be still more professional until October 2020.
Several observatories have already taken sight of the visitor. In a first study, a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, showed the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Records of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear softness of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysics Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already gained the first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sweaters offering a kind of fingerprints of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles such as the processes of comets of our solar system, and that suggests that the comets of our solar system, as well as the comets of our solar system, could be similar to the same.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to an estimate of the IAU, suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such interstellar visitors are still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could be a planned space mission of European satellites.
By 2028, the agency wants to station the three-piece space sonde "Comet Interceptor" (e.g. comet catcher) in a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth. According to Esa Scientific Director Günther Hasinger, it wants to station either on an un touched, fresh comet or on an interseason, as well as on our own solar system.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
At the time before the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic, it is so far: on the new Mega-Airport in the south of China’s capital, a first China United Airlines passenger machine landed, a special honor for captains and crews.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be completed annually at the new airport, and then 72 million will be completed in 2025. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestigious project is also called “seastern” due to its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four start-up and landing trails, which will be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new underground train transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the center of Beijing.
During the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly let Berlin learn from Beijing. The opening of the city’s main airport in Germany, which has been in construction since 2006, has been remotely moved, but a first passenger machine was landing in Beijing after four years.
New supersonic plane plans to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the UK Space Agency dreams. It is intended to make this, for the 2030-year oversonic speed flight, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company has already developed, the company Reaction Engines is running from Oxfordshire for years, the U.S. broadcaster CNN quoted the agency "This is definitely."
To advance the project, the British space agency wants to work together with the Australian closer. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolitan currently takes about 20 hours. As a single oversonic aircraft for passenger transport, NASA was the only way to develop. The Concorded had been covered by 10 to the end of its operations, Charles's operations was decovered by 10 to 2003. The route New York Paris was decovered by three hours.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for more efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, these aircraft can be more realised than ever beyond the generation.
Trump wants to find anonymous tip donors in Ukraine affairs
In the Ukrainian affair for possible power abuse by U.S. President, Donald Trump wants to find possible and decent positions in the White House.
"I want to know who has given the information to the Whistleblower," Trump told employees of the United Nations Embassy in New York on Thursday. The affected person has almost been a "spion" and with such people has been "a little different" in the past than today.
This was assessed as an attempt to threaten Tippers. The event was actually not public. However, several US media spread audio media on Friday. Democrats responded excitedly to the President's statement.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for a Trump Release Procedure on Tuesday. Their charges were mainly based on the written complaints of an anonymous secretary officer, the serious charges against Trump and his government centre. At large public pressure, the presses of the donor were made publicly.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees according to which the US President "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country in favour of his U.S. 2020 elections.
At the center of the charges is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about protecting the previous elections of Biden son Just in Ukraine for the elections of Presidents in 2020.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with regard to the Ukrainian telephone: Leaders of the government would have attempted to keep the exact text text of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic record of the speech protocol was set up for this, but a large record of the system was specifically provided. This was published on the request of a spokesman from the White House.
The recorder's identity is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it should be an employee of the CIA Foreign Secret Service.
Trump again questioned the source's credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among others, that the "so-called Whistleblower" had spread information from second hand that would have proven inappropriate. Therefore, maybe there are no tippers or spies.
As Trump expressed himself in New York about those who have played information on the Whistleblower, but resolved empowerment. President of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded anxiously and complained that Trump’s statement once again undergoes the government’s integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and its surroundings have been conducted for months in various committees. With regard to Ukraine's allegations, Democrats are now underway investigations with a new urge to launch a possible dismissal procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a schedule for our investigation," said Adam Ship, Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the House of Representatives. Trump attacked the ship sharply, filed a misrepresentation of the things to him and again asked the Chairman's resignation. Trump accused the ship regularly and had already requested its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government workers in the security and foreign policy area, who were mostly under democratic but also under Republican presidents, made a statement posted on Friday behind the possible investigation of the Democracy’s cancellation procedure. If the allegations were kept by Trump, it would be “a short-term abuse of power”
There is no precise timetable for the next process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. But the decision on an actual resignation fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are small.
VW Operating Council: Workplaces are decomposed "sleeved"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could lead to the burden of production in Germany and Europe. This concern will turn over the automotive manufacturer’s operating board. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. This will save 500 million euros already this year.
A key to this is the staff costs. The "future pact" negotiated between companies and the Board of Directors in 2016 already anticipates the decreasing of 14,000 jobs alone in Germany by 2020. In principle, a job can only be decomposed by car builder if almost proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance will apply by 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learned from operating council circles, jobs in production that are actually not available will be decomposed "sleeping" through another way - that is, through the official course, so that free-going regular jobs would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Board of Directors does not have the possibility to force the re-occupation. At the same time, there is no staff in many places to increase the labor depletion, the concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicles would be greater. In this way, the fear also increases that the vehicle production could be carried out on a time by time, from Germany and Europe, because it is just as good as it is in other parts of the world.
The brand VW wants to standardize the production worldwide and centralize new projects. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decision-making - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and therefore competitiveness. Production leader Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: “In the unsafe times, China is advised between us Brexit to threaten us to trade.”
Tostmann told reporters that the production time for Golf 8, which will be presented in Wolfsburg on October 24, will be shortened by 1.1 hours, for example, for the first time since 2013, the production costs for each vehicle would decrease.
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are manufactured. The works are brownschweig and salt gitter manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the faucet rule that there are 800,000 cars to be built annually, so that the new use process is satisfyingly profitable. 2018, however, the discharge in Wolfsburg and the recycling of the problem was at about 700,000.
As production leader Tostmann announced last year, however, a million cars will be "perspectively" rolling out of the band in Wolfsburg. This will enable the fusion of golf production in the original work - because Zwickau's factory, through the reconstruction to the location of the e-car production, gives the golf production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have last developed declining. Therefore, expectations on the Golf 8. He is now expected to rest despite all efforts to build the e-mobility.
Voodoo forced to prostitute: human traders condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been wounded, wounded in the ruth area and forced to prostitute, six suspected traders have to go to jail for this.
Six suspected traders from Nigeria were sentenced to convictions and imprisonment on Friday in Bochum for up to eight years and three months. The accused had hurled young Nigerian women into the refugee territory and forced them to prostitution. To force their obedience, they had to be able to go for a while.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were brought by the help of Libyan screws over the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. They were distributed to different boards to work on the alleged screw costs of an average of €25,000. The salary was therefore totally reduced.

The judgments say commercial and binary inclusions of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, sustainability and heavy forced prostitution.

FIm’s ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened Ufo’s airline companionship with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiations table, the union will "inform on 14 October of the working fighting measures in the LH Group", said the Ufo Tariff Chairman Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings refused to conduct tariff negotiations with the Ufo for months.
At this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision by the Labour Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the tariff contracts were not cancelled. The court did not cancel the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examines the appeal against it. "A second court considers the matter completely different, I think it is unlikely," said Ufo-Vorstand Flo.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application to the National Labour Court of Frankfurt to make the status of the UFO as a trade unions in court. The company argued that the trade unions had not set up a representative board for months and therefore was unable to perform its role as a tariff partner.
There was a heavi leadership dispute in the Sparten Union, during which many members of the board and the council have resigned, including long-standing trade union chief Nicoley Baublies, who had been exposed to a urb vote on the strikes of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts of their leadership.

So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but it is now to change. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.

With the new rules, the conservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own use, Riad wants to reduce its oil dependence.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had encountered two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik as well as the oil field Churais. In the following, the national oil production dramatically broke up, the oil prices would take several weeks until the oil production of the kingdom again reach its old nive.

Half of European trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to harmful diseases, region-producing species, non-sustaining wood strike and the growth of cities are causes of threats, the World Nature Protection Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 trees known in Europe. 265 of them are not seen on any other continent.
The IUCN divides threatened species into six categories: from "potentially threatened" to "threely threatened", "threely threatened" and "extermined in nature" to "extermined". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animals and plant species worldwide as "threely threatened".
Eberean and wild Rosskastanie threatened
In Germany, Eberesche (Sorbus) is mostly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German press agency. "Most people are threatened because the populations are small or because of the transformation or weakening of their living spaces."
It is also bad for the wild-free Rosscasthanians. It has been considered as a "threatening" since 2017, the second stage of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is the Balkan mining mote. It has spread from the 1980s to all of the cities of Southeast Europe and has less viewed by this continent and has fewer natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of the Rosscasthanians
Straucharts and Moose are also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists have created new European red lists for soft animals, snakes and mouse. More than one-fifth of the soft animals and mouse and almost half of all snakes are threatened, so the IUCN says. This is mainly important to the destruction of the wilds of the soil, to the destruction of other species, to the destruction of the soil, to the agriculture practice.
“This report shows that the situation is prejudice to many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.

At the time of a recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured, and there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged since the beetle in the last day, and almost 200 post-beetle. The earthquake of the strength 5.8 had shocked the marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the Million Metropole.
Now, if the government wants to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced that Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Sea, Istanbul is considered to be particularly dangerous. A section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder is located, which marks the border between the Eurasical and Anatolic Earth Plate.
One of the heaviest beefs was one of the strongest 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölguk southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.

Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira attend the Half-Time Show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the semi-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "The greater won't get it," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She's crazy to be on the super-bowl book. It's going to be on February 2.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of taking place at Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross flying in the semi-life show. "It's even more special now because the NFL has been 100 years and I'll be performing with another Latina." She could hardly expect to "how what girls can do on the world's largest stage."
Shakira stated in a statement that she feels proud to stand next to another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and around the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "kings" stood on a stage together.
Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining views
The Super Bowl is the highest point of the American football season. The game and the semi-life show are one of the most viewed TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have last seen the numbers of viewers: in this February, the speculation has attracted the least viewers in the United States for more than ten years. However, there are still nearly hundreds of millions in views.
For the last Super Bowl semi-life show, there had been a disruption in advance: in the dispute about the deal with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick in February, according to media reports, Topstars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the semi-life show - the critics were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, was in the 2016/17 game before NFL games at the National Hymne from protest against police rape and racism on the knees. With his protest Kaepernick solved a movement, many players themselves took the geste. This took care of great excitement, and US President Donald Trump no longer attacked.
Cook Plate: hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to be expensive, according to a press report, and high deductions on outstanding bonds and loans are threatened, regardless of whether Credit Suisse is affected, the Financial Times writes in its Friday edition.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would have to take up to £1.8 billion in their books, according to the report.
The borrowers of debts should take deductions from £900 million to £1 billion and the borrowers should take in between £550 and £825 million. The amounts that actually debts are likely to be at the top end of the bandwidths, one expert said to the paper.
How big the losses of creditors will be at the end will be shown after the insolvency procedure is completed. One person close to this procedure has not promised too much hope. For example, if about 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in the UK are "old" and many of the property are in bad stocks. Most of the property, as well as Thomas can go out with the sale of the airportSlot
Rackets have brought alleged murderers to Italy
The Sea-Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have secure information about it," said the spokesman of the Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency.
Other migrants would have re-recognized the three men in Italy. They are alleged to have raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The suspected criminals were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders emphasized that refugee organizations could not check who they had left on their ships.
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29 and had a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects were to arrive there, investigating the captain for aid to illegal immigration.
The US warns the federal government against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet Agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government to trust Chinese networking equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high,” Pai said to the "trade sheet" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which requires every company to follow the instructions of the security agencies under Chinese law.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests,” says the FCC Chief, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to request a "reliability declaration" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" calling on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology consists not only of hardware:
The software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time,” Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority "whenever it is possible to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
Huawei introduces close contacts to the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership conditions are untransparent. The employee company, which is allegedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. suggests findings that government employees have been placed within the company. Pai recently visited Berlin for talks to promote the U.S. position.
Chemical factory in Northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, people hear explosions. A giant fire wall lights the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is deleted after hours, but spacework can now take days.

From the chemical factory, a giant black pillar had risen. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces oil additives. The production facility is a few kilometers away from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations that are particularly supervised. In the Italian Seveso in Milan it was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the news broadcaster BFMTV that there was initially no "high toxicity" in samples. A pollution of the nearby people could not be excluded. In the river, urban areas were built against pollution, the prefecture said.

French Finance Minister: "Germany has to invest now"
French Minister for Economics and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest larger in promoting economic growth in the euro zone.
Germany has to invest now, as soon as it gets better," Le Maire said Thursday in the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the euro area is weakening, the Minister warned.
We should not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.”
Those countries that had budget gambling spaces for more investments should act, Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France has not had these playrooms, added the minister, referring to the high state debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. France's debt must be "stabilized" and "donated", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments to live the European economy; in return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to deal with its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, anticipates tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government reacts, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-eyed movement; the new debt is expected to fall to 2.2%, according to expected 3.1% this year.
Is Johnson still trying to trick?: Johnson raises a question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticizes the "Capitulation Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law calls for the British Prime Minister to avoid chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a flower, but the Tory politician is weakening.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned if he wants to implement an irregular Brexit - despite the last law decided by Parliament, which is exactly what to prevent it. Johnson said to reporters only, his government will comply with the applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a shift of the date of departure should not be agreed with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capital law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the assumption on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political scams" to overcome the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure trick that moves into force the law to the time after the EU's withdrawal. Johnson said he seeks to leave a treaty with the European Union on October 31.
Johnson’s Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings said he felt the political disputes about Brexit as a “Passion in the Park” and convinced himself that the EU’s planned outlet would still be able to: “We enjoy, we will win, we will be following a book, i.e., we will not be worried about a book before “expecting from the EU”
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" before the 2016 EU referendum, now acts as a headquarters in the British government headquarters Downing Street.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Pockets) enters deep into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who had been married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid September at Victoria and Albert Museum in London, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders' wife Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an exceptional family from time before Instagram, a celebration for the possession of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the quick magic of the Polaroid film.”
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made her, several hundred of them are now published for the first time in The Polaroid Diaries.
There are portraits, quiet life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s until the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes artistic critic Ekow Eshun in his speech. And of course, once again stands in the center: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
Since he danced on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, phoned in the bathrobe with a tits on his head or wearing unformed Moonboats. Of course, the McCartneys were an exceptional family, but beyond the light light on her farm in Southern England or Scotland, it wasn't a very normal life with a baby.
As hardly as a different medium, the poloraid camera takes the moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure shooting.
It's about the decision click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it at the right moment," Paul McCartney said. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds later, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift, always took it the right moment," she just said.
There is light, composition, image cut, and colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a fun picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes are already like abstract paintings in the road. The perfect addition to Be-to-Be-to-Be-to-Be-to-Be-to-Be-to-Be-to-Be-To-Be
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkey wants to continue import oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite U.S. sanctions imposed against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems with Iranian oil imports as some companies had withdrawn “for US threats”.
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran in particular in this matter and in many other matters," the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past, said.
Since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran has secretly pursued a nuclear program and does not comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and the tensions in the Gulf region have been significantly worsening in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict refugees’ inclusion
The U.S. government wants to drastically limit the inclusion of refugees. The U.S. foreign ministry said on Thursday that the annual limits of a new settlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to a cut of 40 per cent.
The foreign ministry said that the U.S. would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger, as stated by the Foreign Ministry's statement.
At the 1980 program, refugees are selected from UN camps all over the world and resettled in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current upper limit of 30,000 is almost a deepest value. As the predecessor of the U.S. President was Obama, the President Donald Trump.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, who would further damage their leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the United States - legally and illegally -. The US government expects its own information for the next financial year 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a Spitzel"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused reporters in the spy’s Whistleblower affair. Anyone who has allowed him to abuse power to give him the corresponding indications "comes close to a spice," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York.
After that, Trump spoke to U.N. mission employees. When asked the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial processes in the White House, he replied: "It's coming close to a spice." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times differently than we were?" Right to do it. We're going to spy now.
The observers appreciated the last comment on a possible allegation to the death penalty. The Democrats criticized Trump's statements and gave him anxiety from witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a possible congressional investigation into an office office, the chairmans of the Board of Directors, and the chairmans of the Board of Directors wrote.
The Whistleblower pleads to the President in a complaint now published to have abused his office in order to ask for an intervention of another country in the US 2020 election. Among other things, it is about meeting his controversial telephone call with his son of Ukraine's Joyce President Volodymyr Selenskyj's any Democratic meeting in the summer: In the conversation, Biel put him in close contact
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower is and who it is, but, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.

The Who Brechen Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who found a hard end due to the infiniteness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the midst of his performance on Wednesday night in Houston, his voice failed. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it goes".

Hire suddenly suspended: WeWork lets real estate markets sit
WeWork has risen to be the largest office officer in New York City.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from the small startup to the driving force to the most expensive real estate markets in the world, but now the company is in crisis. Renters need to be afraid of billions of revenues.
The crisis of the WeWork's office renter threatened to disrupt the balance of the world's largest real estate markets. The company had suspended Adam Neumann as the founder a few days ago, moved the planned exchange rate and began with the sale of New London daughters and values like the investment for the privatejet. We immediately reported the new investments for the managers, "Welcome financial space for the next weeks and months."
WeWork rents large office areas in the long term and now rents them in part small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or whole departments of large companies. Until now WeWork burns money with this business, it is not going to take up $2 billion in total $1, billion in total $1, billion in total $1, billion in total $1, billion in total $1, billion in total $1.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with a duration of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than $40 billion arose. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but also for the entire real estate markets.
Computing of the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York,WeWork rented in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months nearly 300,000 square meters of office. Only WeWorks contracts made sure that the demand for offices in New York was larger. Weperter was in time in time. Weperter was in time in time.
Also in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeable without further expansion of the aggressive startup. WeWork is the main lease, in the last year a Deka office purchased for nearly €100 million in the center of the financial metropoly.
Many renters have reconstructed their property for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make his business model profitable soon, the real estate owners have to deduct part of the expected billion revenue. Access to the - nevertheless bare - reserves of WeWork company they have normally made for the long-term rental contracts.

"Last Friday have spread over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. To date, under the 6383 campaigns in 170 countries, she added.
In particular, last Friday in Germany, a good third of all worldwide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimated Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of movements, customers are planned in at least 65 cities, but the smaller cities in the city will go in at least 65 cities, including in metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich.
At the age of 15 at that time, Thunberg stood before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call for its country’s politicians to make a stronger effort to protect climate. Within a short time, Fridays for future movement emerged. At the climate protests, mostly students and students participate, but increasingly scientists and other adults.
Together, they require more ambition from politics in the fight against earth warming and threatening climate disasters, and in particular, under the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming should be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg arrived in New York nearly a month ago after a two-week transatlantic session with a high-sea rainbow. She had recently participated in climate protests and UN summits. On Monday, she held an emotional speech at the UN involving the Nobel Prize, where she became an interference to the state and government leaders of the earth involving her alternative climate.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia should no longer smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow on Thursday, according to the Tass Agency. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, however, must expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette had to cut a fire, then the punishment is higher. The ban falls under the same burning candles, according to the ministry, and candlesticks on the balcony are no longer allowed to grill.
Attack against cybercriminals - Detectives raise servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a major server provider for illegal businesses in Darknet.
A total of 13 criminals are suspected to have hosted numerous websites by operators of a data center in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel, where internationally acting criminals operate their machinity.
This was reported by the Prosecutor General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday night. The Darknet is a screened part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are to be, among other things, operators of the world's second-largest Darknet Drug Market, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had broken in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a host was first raised in Germany, a webhoster said, providing the infrastructure for an internet presence.
The access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 has been conducted in Germany and the neighbouring abroad. It has been a result of nearly five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators want to inform more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests have been held, thousands of people are going to the streets again for more climate protection.
In order to complete an international climate strike campaign, the Fridays for Future Movement plans again for action and customer relationships in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolitans such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests ̈ Who are actually Thunbergs Hintermeners?
Righteousness and courage are high dignity, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that heat the climate. As surprisingly as a 16-year-old girl counts the people of this time on the nose. But what is behind it? Is it a helpful manipulator or a smart tactic marketing about a climate activist?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in movement and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young man is able to win a collection of children and adolescents for himself. Already in 1212, greeting has been able to take over a trip, a child named Nikolaus has been able to take over to the world.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. In addition, her mother has published a book which has been selling a lot of money, which has been selling a lot of money, which has been selling a lot of money over the course of the world, because of the missing.
Now the spirits differ: Is it morally right to enrich financially when rescuing the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of persons work together during the World Stock Exchange Action? No matter what position is ultimately related to trend, a critical and reflective perspective is more and more important from a democratically characterized point of view, because it can also be criticized by society.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed by our solar system
A foreign comet currently crosses our solar system.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed: a foreign comet currently crosses our solar system – it is only the second of its species.
Garching/Washington - Longe have only suspected, but now they are certain: a comet from another star has now crossed our solar system. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employed by astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers on Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. Actually, it is an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second one that was seen by his type of flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to draw close insights into a foreign solar system. Obviously, the comet is similar to the comet of our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reports. The comet is clearly interstellar, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and moves out of our system, which currently runs on a so-called hyperway.
Comet has already been seen before the arrival – and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can watch him closely. Because, unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his attack, which means that he can still be examined from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest professional light in mid-December 2020 and then will be larger in the course of telescopes in the middle of December 2020 and then in the middle of April 2020.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First Insights About Comet 2I/Borisov Were Hope in Science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the heavenly body appears to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the sweat star is similar to ours. This observation is close to the fact that comets in other solar systems can be formed in similar processes.
However, observation goes beyond individual recognition: that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems may be allowed.
Asteroids are always busy, and only recently, a giant asteroid came across the Earth and came to her dangerously.
"Absolutely Refusing": Rachel Johnson Is Anxious about Brother
Boris Johnson becomes lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister clearly crawls the war language of the Premier as "tasteless." It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Falm", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands under pressure and continues to equip - at least verbal. At the time of questioning at the sub-home this Wednesday, this occurred on massive empowerment of the opposition, and in the meantime, other critics have reported: Dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the broadcaster Sky News, her brother used words like capitulation, as if opponents of an EU exit should be "heated, stretched, quarted, stabbed and fed". She deemed that it was too rejective. She did not recognize her brother's version again, said RachelB, who joined the UK parliament.
In particular, she knew that her brother Jo Cox was mentioning, a EU-friendly sub-deputy who was murdered a few days before the 2016 retreat by a Neo-Nazi. Their remembrance can be most honored by passing through the Brexit first, someone had said, "It's a very cruel lager. It's a very cruel lager now, it's a very cruel layer.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick if Jos name is used so," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to be when you are passionate and determined to enter what you believe - no matter what you are. But never "the other side of the attack" should be demonized.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, the younger brother Jo, had established his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory Deputy. "I had broken in the past months between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an insolvable tension," Jo Johnson said.
Johnson's language was also critical in the church. As the "Times" report, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy." In a common statement they said: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside parliament, is not acceptable to speak with each other."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez attend the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100-year-old existence, the NFL has a strong sign: in the upcoming Super Bowl half-time show, two women with Latino forms appear, promising "a explosion of fun and energy".
The Latina Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the semi-time show in the upcoming final of the US Football League NFL.
“I feel incredibly honoured and humble to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredibly strong strength in the United States,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on 2 February. In the metropole of South Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is portorican.
"I love the Super Bowl to put two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents moved from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed large hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Artists" in the German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known as a star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia. She created her global breakthrough in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the semiconductors is expected to be stressed every time in the United States. This year many appreciate the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sport event and at the same time a gigantic advertising show. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones took care of Furore there. Usually watch more than 100 million television spectators at the NFL Final. It is also popular in the middle of Germany.
Last year there was political controversy. The reason for the Quarterback was Colin Kaepernick, who for protest against police violence against blacks had refused to rise to the national hymn, and for many of them had been hard to deal with, among other things, by U.S. President Donald Trump's group.
An actor and Youtuber adds to Egypt's rulers: First, Mohamed Ali is still alive abroad.
The two men who influenced whether the Egyptian streets were flowing blood again, both spent last week abroad. One of the two moved back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi told the President of the United Nations returned security from the United Nations General General of the United States. President of the United States of America, Trump's President of the United States of America, Trump's President of the United States of America, Trump's President of the United States of America.
It leads to the error - it is the point of view of the president of the other man who is currently determined to happen on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad where he escaped the access of security forces who would immediately attempted to arrest him when he had entered his Egyptian soil: Teerle's secret to enter his country's police room. The 45-year-old was known to the country's voice, "disp on the only minority.
He goes directly to the head of the state and in quite rustic language. While the people are hanging, swinging the president in luxury, and allowing themselves to build magnificent new palaces, it says. The army leadership, on which Sisi relys his dominion, throws Ali to the point of corruption and regioning. Because in his second entrepreneurship, he knows exactly what he does, just like 15 years ago, he speaks exactly with these men.
After last week's first time since Sisis grew up after power, thousands of protesters had demonstrated against his rule and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights attorneys and opposition politicians had been arrested independently, Ali called for this Friday to a "Millioner security protesters showing their example, as well as that really so many protesters would ride on the streets, but it was unlikely.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators wanted to break banner in pieces with the portrait of the president, Sizsis was reported mass police presence on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the highways. In Cairo, here were several firebank stations were blocked in 2013, President was blocked in 2011 due to the city's " maintenance work" and Armed forces were blocked to Ta's around the streets.
Mohamed Ali encouraged these measures to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not meet with police officers." As a retreat, but it is not to be understood: "Great Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection is always much slower than the provider promoted, there are various testing options.
Anyone who concludes an internet contract does not need blindly to trust the provider’s speed data. Customers can, if noticeable, check how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore also be achieved, the consumer central Bavaria explains.
If the connection is always much slower than the provider, there are various testing options, so the measurements of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the Treaty.
“But the suppliers’ tests are carried out in accordance with supplier specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated,” the consumer centers of Bavaria said on their side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can typically set the provider a reasonable time limit of 14 days to make the promised performance. This is the best possible for the person concerned by writing in writing.
If this does not do anything after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also require damages, but in the case of remaining success, only the complaint will help.
First-range Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the governor of Vermont pronounced himself for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it leads out of here, is determined by the facts that will be determined by action that will be determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a telephone call to investigate interventions of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far been criticized by Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort. Scott’s statements are the first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly turned against Trump’s policy, for example, against the locking of environmental regulations and the aggravation of disruption.
Spider-Man remains in MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how it should continue with the films about Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This reports in accordance with several US media. According to this, it is also intended to establish the cinema launch: In the United States, the film will start from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel Boss Kevin Feige cited: "I am pleased that Spidey's way will continue in MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony will never continue to work on his future Spidey Verse."
But what about the sudden good news? It is alleged that Sony Marvel has submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent of the revenue of the upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
This is how Duke Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" Final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now played in the U.S. in the big final. In the final, there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who have been involved in the series for many years, was charmingly included in Tributfin.
One preceding: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final goodbye as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some views showed again the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the missing and happy wedding with Mike or how they defeated him after his death.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was contemptly mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) turns straight to the altar to get married to his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), you just want to know about the loss of the England, you just want to get to see a princess of the England, makes Harvey (Gabriel power, 47) a lot of remarking note.
Egeis: Baby and four more children drinking in boat luck
A baby and four other children were drunk in the Egean camps, and seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday, and the nationalities were still unclear.
The boat landed near the Greek island of Inousses, which is between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were saved.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of Egeis. Last year, according to the UNHCR, 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that they want to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU Commissioner, he wants to "inform himself in Turkey about the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday, and he wants to learn more about the "Greek administrative problems" in Athens to help deal with.
A spokeswoman of the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned journey of Seehofers with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey; only 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands on Tuesday, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal still work?
The rising numbers have ultimately caused doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey Agreement. This provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who are illegally crossing Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take a Syrian refugee for every deported Syrian refugee.
However, the processing of asylum requests comes from Greek deficiency only. In Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are nearly 29,400 people. The worst is in Lesbos: in a camp with capacity for 650 people, there are currently 5,200 migrants.
There have never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, state broadcaster said.
Climate Change: Heat causes more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system on the sample in the future. Climate change will be "somewhat secure" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart-circuit system made high temperatures and large temperature breakthroughs.
Green politician must be responsible for a shameful photo panel
The chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign, was manipulated for this reason by the cups?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite unnoticed for a long time - and finally noticed. The reuseable coffee cup with metal strawberries, Elizabeth May, the chief of the Canadian Greens, never held in hand. On the party's website she was able to see a photo with this cup, was widely reported with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the Poster was also published - and the photo was also too hot.
Green Chief must be responsible for photopane
The National Post then proposed manipulation and that the party produces Fake News to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection," and that in the midst of an election campaign to the sub-house election, where Trudeau is increasingly difficult because of a scam scandal.
The photo went viral in social media and began the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counter-report of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their single-way cups."
May was shocked and reassured on her blog, not knowing anything about this action. To underline it, she posted the original: she, talking with citizens, a cup in the hand. However, she put her right, she was from bamboo. She has always been there. A party spokesman told her that it was just about taking a photo and going to the party logo.
May writes, "I don't want to describe him as stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian at the same time, she asked something of her overwhelmed team: "If they like to edit a picture again, wouldn't they do what to do with my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens were also advised for their use of one-way plastic or for their flight trips to Shitstorms - however, their pictures were not photographed. As the chief of Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, in the holidays of ice with plastic teaspoons, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants Free Upgrade: Lifetime flight ban at Cathay
It is alleged that Jaqueline Ng has been ensuring an upgrade by Cathay Pacific by email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she couldn't be on board - and she shouldn't be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontanically get an upgrade to the Business Class - many of which dreams of passengers. Sometimes they have luck, and employees at check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively requested the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users on Instagram. On May 30, she returned from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the flight, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she had provided an email in which her Cathay Pacific claimed to have upgraded. The letter would like to have received the influencer from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accused Jaqueline of fake mails.
At the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-term flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked at the center. And in fact, the employees from which the email is allegedly coming from, the message was not confirmed in Jaqueline.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled the Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about $1,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also required the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains closed for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that this does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy it - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices report on gun stops in Yemen after
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea Sort Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4% less than yesterday. The price for a barrel of the American Sort West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3% to $55.77.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a weapon stop in Yemen, Saudi Arabia is expected to have voted for a weapon stop in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought about five percent of global oil production in mid-September. The allied Huthi rebels in the country of civil war in Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia like the U.S. government makes Iran responsible. A weapon stop in a political tension
If an agreement could actually be achieved, you can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw materials strategy department at the Saxo Bank of the news agency Bloomberg.
The oil prices continued its downward movement in the past days, a week ago a barrel WTI oil had still cost up to nearly $59, Brent had almost $65.
Recently, Bloomberg reported that repairing oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September came faster than expected, so the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press releases calling on Insiders reporting on rapid progress from the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work, but raw materials experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco currently wants to plan a stock exchange and avoid negative strikes.
At the same time, some relaxation occurred in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the establishment by Iran and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port.
However, the U.S. announced the defence missiles and soldiers to move to Saudi Arabia to the Iranian enemy. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the UK had temporarily increased the oil prices over the past few weeks.
Prosecutions against Trump worsened
In the affair of possible power abuse by US President Donald Trump, prosecutions against the White House have become voiced. Several leading government employees have intensified their efforts, after a controversial call between Trump and the Ukrainian President's commentary was spoken by the President of the House of Representatives Walodimir Selenskyi, spokesman of the House of Representatives Trump said an anonymous access to the speech.
North Korea considers Trump and Kim’s third summit as questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit by power holder Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and the prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said Chim'Aur Kye-gwan.
The U.S. had not done anything for implementing the decisions of the summit last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser said, as well as criticizing harder U.S. sanctions and the joint military operations of the U.S. and South Korea, but hoped for a "smart" and "written" decision by Trump to bring it back to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday he would only want to know what to bring a third summit with Kim before he is ready to make a statement. The negotiations on a disruption of the North Korean atomic and missile program have been negotiations since the missing second summit of Trump and Kim, but the great success of the Trump and Kim in February, back to the Dating Miles in Hanoi.

Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
Given a low interest rate, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a long-term interest rate rate of the Bank of England (BoE) allocate the pound Sterling. The British currency grew up up to 0.4 percent on Friday to $1,269.
The launchers of the sales were the statements of the noted banker Michael Saunders. This brought a reduction in interest rate even if a chaotic Brexit could be rejected as uncertainty will affect the British economy at predictable time. This statement is surprising, since Saunders as a defender of a restrictive money policy, said Activy.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the burden on the economy by the Brexit-Hickhack, without direct signaling a rate reduction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, if necessary, wants to lead his country out of the EU even without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could be paid for him, said trade magazine editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian manipulations have been demonstrated
This confirms David Howman, head of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today’s head of integrity of the Body Athletics World Alliance.
At the start of the Leach Athletics Championships new details come to the doping scandal in Russia - and they destroy the little of credibility that the Russian sport had won at the beginning of the year and also only usefully back. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples. NowAnti was released from the 2012-2015.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russia’s sports. Wada had closed the Russian antidoping agency for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee was also attending 16th February after individual testing at the Sports Championships, at 270th Summer Games in Rio.
Lack of positive findings
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada bands again, but requested access to the laboratory and the claimed samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the torture of doping cases in state-doping. They should help punish athletes and athletes later. Three months later they were finalized.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data were manipulated from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory. "Yes. We received the data positive nine months ago. We should check many data between the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview.
The World Cup does not affect
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The Association of Sports Athletics holds the only organization on the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they were trained and tested outside the Russian system.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already set out manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
