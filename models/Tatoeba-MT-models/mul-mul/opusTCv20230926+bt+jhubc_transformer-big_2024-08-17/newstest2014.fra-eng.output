Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it passed 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located over 3,000 meters of height, where many badauds had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While the U.S. road network planners are hard to find the money needed to repair the highway infrastructure in decree, many of them intervene a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above your car board.
Device, which records every miles away by a driver and transmits the information to officials, is at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the government planning offices to change the obsolete U.S. main road financing system.
The sector generally uninterested for the planning of the large axes has suddenly caused a strong animated debate and movement alliances.
Liberals joined environmental groups to make pressure so that the government uses small boxes to keep track of the miles you’re traveling, and possibly the road you’re traveling, and then use the information to draw up a draft tax law.
The Tea Party is landing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while Congress members are not able to agree on whether to continue, several States have not been waiting.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay depending on the number of miles run.
Thousands of car drivers have already launched these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is really essential for our nation.
“It’s not as if we had the choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state begins to record the miles driven by each California driver by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes that Americans pay to the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans are buying as much fuel as before.
Cars can travel over miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are opposed to increase taxes, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at Minnesota University.
The state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
“This proves to be the long-term logic alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls it the use costs in the kilometers.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, as taxes could be used to modify driving habits in order to allow for reducing gas emissions, for example.
California’s planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the state’s ambitious climate warming laws.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
The free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for miles.
“It’s not just a tax in a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they have earned.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretarys who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go into the way of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a pilot project of $90 billion last year that would have weared about 10,000 cars.
But the Chairmanship of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel several miles every day to their work or town.
Nevertheless, several states and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregone, which has mobilised 5,000 drivers to lead the country’s most important experience.
These car drivers will soon pay the state kilometre expenses instead of fuel taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York considers one.
Illinois tests a limited number of trucks.
And the coalition I-95, which includes 17 road transport agencies in East American coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer car drivers recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were worried that the government could follow their fewer facts and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and such things are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into entirely localization devices.”
It is not necessary to build a huge and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will be inevitablely expanded to keep records of people's everyday walks and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that now depart to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do this, the citizens will be more comfortable, said Khan.
The research on this technology led some state agencies to call for a small startup in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not intended to help drivers paying taxes to the States.
She sought to perch into the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers would pay based on their kilometers.
But the devices it tests like the large axis planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
“People will be more likely to do so if you don’t record their speed and don’t locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been serious mistakes in pilot programmes in some States.
There are far less expensive ways and far less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different choices to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to unbelievable citizens by allowing devices to do more than enough.
In New York City, transportation officers are seeking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide a "driven payment" insurance and create a set of data on real-time speed from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid drilling.
“Car drivers would be encouraged to participate due to the benefits the system offers,” a document on urban planning said.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the entire debate on the payment of the mile is simply a huge divergence.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay area, officials say that Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund’s bankruptcy by increasing fuel taxes.
A single or annual additional tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicles drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of fuel, so that each pay its right share.
"It is not necessary to use radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," Randy Rentschler, director of law and public affairs at the committee said.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of car drivers will be worried about the protection of their privacy and lots of other things.
David Bowie: Four inedits in listening
The English musician wasn’t surprised this year.
From The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury reedition scheduled for November 4, with several inedits.
Four have already appeared on the Toile.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantyhose.
On his 66th anniversary, January 8, 2013, he had announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Reality, 2003) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that we could still rely on him to make the pop scene shine.
A celebration for his fans
David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke plans to re-edite this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real party for his fans.
This reedition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, single studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already disclosed clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially disclosed for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the discs, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive photos and pockets, a booklet to share its own impressions, a booklet with words...
And, above all, he gives a pre-taste of his new Atomica title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very advanced guitars and a softly controlled rock electricity.
Inedits already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on board.
The Informer is double-faced: an alarming intro in front of a bright horseback that gradually slows down to leave room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, or even to Gravity?
With this enjoyed title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, alongside, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: Will it come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enthusiasts, give a desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie enjoys playing the camellon with these titles: in turn informator, man on a rocket, potential...
He simulates and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different characters, as he did throughout his career, including his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing is surprising that he has a handmaske in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation to Travel, from the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he incarns.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10th.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not totally released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civil life.
Attack by the Liberals and Neo-Democrates to the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, the army members followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All injured soldiers receive appropriate care in order to return to civil life and none of them is released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not comply with the army's "universal service" rule demanding that staff are able to carry out a series of various tasks - to reach the 10-year eligible period required for retirement benefits.
They mentioned two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including one of a soldier released on Friday.
Caporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, who suffered post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to remain for another year to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after the case of Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been forced to leave before he was ready because he did not meet the universal rule of the service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was completely different from the fact that he wanted to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with the Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of the major battles in Afghanistan, the army has hardly determined the latitude it can award to the wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are not fit for the battle.
According to current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service duration required to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal Speaker on former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday for reintegration of the Hawkins capital, while Neo-Democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney puts on tablets to launch a animated series
The U.S. media and entertainment group Disney decided to prefer tablets to its own TV channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet application.
Its global launch on the Disney Group channels is only planned in 2014, the Disney Junior Division’s statement.
The animated drawing, designed for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of cat Callie, sheriff of a city in the western American where she makes the order ruling with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two stories of 11 minutes.
“Interaction with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, Vice-President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, in a statement.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published in the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the under 2 years had already served on a tablet or phone, and 72% of the under 8 years, respectively, against 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “co-operate” with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, U.S. Information Service Representative, said he was willing to visit Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented by the MEP in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to deal with the difference in opinion as a escape and seeks to penalize the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
To say the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he thought the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges held against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of spying and stealing state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said at Zeit Online: “If Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been hard tested after complaints that the NSA had put on the hearing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, deputy leader of the parliamentary group overseer of foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness “without threatening him and completely ruining his relations with the United States,” it should be enjoyed.
Mr. Ströbele, Deputy Green German, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to former NSA advisor’s lawyer, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden witnessed in Germany, he would have to make sure that he would be "safe" there, said the Deputy.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subject to a "grave and supportive" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens from all over the world, as well as senior officials, including the United States, considered that the disclosure of an unexplainable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility.
The letter forwards an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the problems of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Cogeco Cable can soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video service on demand via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so far away.
Cogeco’s subsidiary reported on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
“This will enable us to emphasize more friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco’s president and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus embodies the step to its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco’s subsidiary has not yet had a precise date regarding this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools to which our customers don’t currently have access.
The telecommunications giant Rogers has already stated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be adjusted.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussion with some major cable distributors in order to make its service available via their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Government of Harper in his speech of the Throne, last October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay the card services.
“It’s been about two and a half years ago that we say that the idea of forced consumers to buy important chain packages does not work,” Audet said.
However, it hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will result in interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy as regards television," Cogeco said.
CRTC has conducted consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry next spring.
In addition to the results, Cogeco reported that it had recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 per action.
This is a decline compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 per action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by amortisation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal.
In December last, the Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an internet provider established in Vancouver, for a total of 526 million.
As for Cogeco’s income, they experienced a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 <0xEF><0x82><0xB7> per share, as compared to 45.7 million, or 93 <0xEF><0x82><0xB7> per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenue increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is rising 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not the indication of a trend change, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to another with a very strong competition.
Horse in products to cow
Horse meat was deleted in containers of cattle-based products, sold by two small British low-price distribution firms, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine tests have shown that products developed in January and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
“As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it shouldn’t have been present in the product,” the British agency said.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission’s surveys, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only cattle.
A collision between two vehicles caused four injured on Friday on the road 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 p.m., a car driver traveling north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that came in the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid of their lives.
The circulation was returned to normal at 6 p.m. Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement, it indicated that passengers could take the unopen basket with them to the plane’s downstairs.
New hand luggage fees relate to bags ranked in the upper room, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said she would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers were paying only once at the landing gate.
Frontier’s spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said $100 were planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she explained.
The airlines started paying the first and second luggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these fees put as much things as they could in hand luggage ranked in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in these compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees would not really serve to collect money.
It is to make Frontier’s most loyal customers understand that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger carrying a knife at a Frontier landing door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the knife might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these fees before arriving at the door.
Frontier’s hand luggage costs will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been fixed.
Passengers often ask about luggage fees and other fees, but airlines like them.
They believe that the costs of handling luggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street consider the addition of luggage costs as a sign that proves that airlines are paying expensive enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them have not affected the luggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage fees three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline that charges such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the consultant from the airlines Jay Sorensen, which closely follows the fees for an additional fee.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage costs were $50 billion per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines manager, recently travelled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the landing gate when passengers would discover the unusual hand luggage costs imposed by the company.
“I have never seen such a fluid landing procedure throughout my professional career,” he said.
I was waiting to see teeth grinding and a brick climbing at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passagers are mounted on board at the speed of light.”
Border also does as Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can bring the non-open pen with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways has briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to pay luggage charges when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced miles premiums by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000 miles Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal customer in its hometown, Denver, but her activity declines and she loses money.
The revenue fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% during the first quarter, according to the financial results published Wednesday by its mother company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to redirect the finances of Frontier by selling the airline.
The NSA is questioning a “intern error” rather than a computer pirate for the failure of its website
The National Security Agency, working in the shadow, said Friday it was a bug that caused its public site failure for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed it online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that took place during a planned update,” the spy agency said in a statement by email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA site had been intact for at least 6 hours, and some users can still not access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hacktiffs claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks target a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapse.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, a time called "No Such Agency", has been found under the fire of the projectors and has been strongly criticized over the past few months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communication surveillance programs – which are part of the NSA secret files, NSA’s consultants, stolen by the NSA, said.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused many speculations that the incident tonight was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-City now closed
The hotel Delta Centre-Ville closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people were working at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let her employees fall.
Employees came to meet employees directly on-site, and we met employees individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” explains the Regional Director of Labour Relations at Hotel Delta, Félix Bisson.
The close of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was owner of this building had choices to do.
Whether it was reinvesting in the building to continue operating, so there were dozens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Whether he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, chairman of the Transat Tourism at the School of Sciences of UQAM Management.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the next few months, such as the Crown Plaza which will become a residence for elderly people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For the CEO of Titan, "the Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the eponge with weaknesses in January for the partial resuming of the Goodyear site of Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of American tire Titan, says today, is ready to save 333 jobs from the 137 factory counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, minister of productive recovery, had already announced it on Monday, October 21st.
After resigning from the plant purchase project in January, you are returning today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers", who "work three hours" per day, "four" trade unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is it to enjoy Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when France is working eight hours with disabilities in other countries.
In India, China, and in many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudice on France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan so much need this factory?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a proper price and competent workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement that the factory was closed, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine Titan buys the closed factory at Goodyear.
As a result, Titan could move machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows this.
But he wants to keep the factory of Amiens with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among the approximately 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to bring the CGT to the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on starting compensation for all employees.
There will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister was 333.
I know he wants a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting compensation.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide duration guarantees when no employees are left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg achieves that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
The benefit of Bombardier decreases, while the delivery and orders of aircraft decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian airline and rail manufacturer, reported a decline of 15% of its net profit on Thursday, under pressure of a decrease in orders and delivery of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also provided flight test data for all of its new CSeries aircraft or information to see if the aircraft will comply with its ambitious schedule of commercial service before September.
After the opening flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the latter only flew three times, and then the question was whether the test phase was on the right path.
The results were not at the height of the forecasts and the share rate decreased by 8% at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, has reduced its rating on Thursday, switching from “superperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential of the stock exchange increase over the next quarter or two next quarters.
“Although the decline in aircraft delivery has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the beneficiary margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as long as the flight test program will advance.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far moderate as to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims on energy efficiency and potential savings of the new line aircraft.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is commercially serviced.
The leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday by indicating that the program was moving forward in accordance with the calendar.
"The test plane has not remained on the ground longer than expected," Mr. Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to do a first flight and to anticipate an update period, and that's what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight schedule.
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first client can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said she was about to assess the entry schedule and will provide new information over the next few months.
“This slowness of flight tests – although it appears to be in line with Bombardier’s internal calendar – strengthens our opinion that the entry to service will be revoked in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter closed on September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The result per adjusted action remained unchanged to 9 cents.
The revenue decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a score of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth airline manufacturer in the world said it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 years earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautical Division was $32.9 billion by September 30, unchanged figure compared to December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
Aeronautical revenue fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railroad manufacturer, said the revenue of this division had increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The Transport Division order card totaled $32.6 billion by September 30, or a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered execution problems with some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc.’s financial management, would be headed to the board, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars on Thursday afternoon.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third airline manufacturer in the world and competing closest to Bombardier, reported a decline of its quarterly profit by 10% on Thursday.
Two spellologists 23 and 27 years old had been carried out in a sweat under the Crolles Dent since Thursday evening, we learned Friday from the Spell of the Isère.
They were localized this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one aguerri to practice and the other no, were left underground on Thursday at 21:30 to carry out a crossroads from the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
There was no news about them since, the same source said.
"The spéléologists had to go out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at Spéléo Emergency Organization.
Dozens of people on site
Twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French rescue Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were in place.
At the end of the afternoon Friday, the two spellologists were localized.
“It is another group of speculists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cave, transmitted the information to one of the networking emergency teams,” says Le Dauphiné.
The two military at the 13th battalion of Chambéry's Alpine Hunters were found "eputed, but not wounded".
They lost in the network, turned on their steps while waiting for the rescue, the prefecture said.
Re-fed, they should come out of the cave with the help of rescue workers at night.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalist Union on Thursday invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo’s online services after new revelations on U.S. and UK information services activities.
"The German Journalist Federation recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and emails until new orders," she said in a statement.
It judges “scanning” the information from the Washington Post, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," Michael Konken, chairman of the trade unions claiming 38,000 members.
Fire repens: Deputy requests Brigitte Grouwels’ resignation
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "relifting" signal fires in Brussels does not like everyone.
The Brussels Minister for Public Labour and Transport launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday to repain 16 signaling lights from the region in yellow and blue Brussels.
The aim is both to "increase security" and "Brussels' identity".
The idea is, in the end, to repain all Brussels signaling fires, for an estimated cost of about a million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is “too dark,” according to Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of “flamandization” of the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels’ “demission”.
"Not happy to spend the money of the Brussels in relifting operations of the Brussels region's color signaling channels, Brigitte Grouwels continues its capital flaming operations," De Bock said in a statement.
After its yellow-black-mange taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-black-black-black potatoes in Brussels.
According to the parliament, there is no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The Brussels people deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who performs the NVA program itself.
It is time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"To recall, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of Brussels people!", concluded De Bock.
the port of Pont-de-Buis demonted
The ecotac port of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent protest of opponents took place on Saturday, was demolished on Thursday morning.
Straws arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the national was turned into the crowd.
The decision of dismantling, announced by the prefecture of the Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, port manager.
It is the last of the three ecotax portions capable of operating in the Department of Finistère, the other two having been demoted or saboted.
Launch of a Google Glass Accessories Store
A online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger, or even a storage stove.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective helmet made of microfibers or an intra-ear headphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has been confirmed yet.
Five years ago, my father was removed from the world of the living.
At the beginning I denied his death, I spoke of him to the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequent it".
There is no recipe, manual to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
For the first time, it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a soft wake up at night to look at his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
This is the image of my smiling father who accompany me in my everyday gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that was what I thought on the day I found his body empty, screaming on this hospital bed with frozen draps.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacier goodbye focused around the slight light of the candlesticks that would frame his circle.
I thought she was gone.
Slowly, by small day-to-night appearances, slightly timid, slightly deleted, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving in a hurry and as she took her place back in the landscape of my thought that was believed in sadness.
And then, she revealed to me while revealing my own facets that I had not yet noticed, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost the person of my mother, but just a woman I really didn’t know, a woman that incarnated this person during her stay in life.
When she died, she had perfect life and released the person I loved, and behold, I found her back, full and full.
This way of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It’s a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as outside."
It's always been told.
I never believed it at that time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he became old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him anymore and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He was speaking to me, he was constantly encouraging me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I borrowed my body to him.
But it was never indiscrete.
I could have had a personal life.
He left my privacy.
It took a long time and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and calm to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life, makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they say? What would they think? What would they do?
I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it’s too late, only there’s always something that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams bring me on the contrary and enrol in my story and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The night of my ultrasound, when I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I woke up, I sat out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the stairs and he smiled and was glad I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was happy to share what was coming to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my stomach.
I liked to share this moment with him and I’m glad to tell this common memory living after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
It is the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
Despite everything, I realized my sadness quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learn Arabic and interest me in the Middle East, to make a master in a large school, have not been, with the reduction, anodin choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before regain France at the time of independence.
The values she inculcated me are always present, so that I can think of how she would like to act at a certain point.
It is the same for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the generosity and the equity of the mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it like a daily presence, a kind soul, a savior spirit.
I see his eyes laying on me.
My mother died nine years ago now.
He died after he talked to me on the phone.
I have passed through all stages: incomprehension, anger, pain, weeping that trigger itself alone, anywhere, at any time, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
The time then calmed down the punishment.
Only the lack, this vacuum without reply, this need of her, to trust me, to refresh me to the crew of her mildness.
However, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes laying on me, I see the dark ones shaking her eyes, the rides around the lips that crushed cigarettes, the plumes that mark the front of the days of anxiety.
My mother took hold of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually recaptured a smile, and pronouncing his name is no longer a taboo, but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to him in the night crow when the absence hurts too much, she invites in my dreams when morality is slightly achieved.
We feel wearing and protected in difficult times, the shortage of time makes us realize how much she was an orchestra leader and we try to stay in the way she had traced us.
If a person loved you very strongly, the absence can't pull it out of your heart and memories.
In some way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 due to a breast cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted depending on what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from theirs, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
In addition, I had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it’s impossible to go in a opposite sense, I don’t miss it and I always ask what he’ll think about it.
I don’t know if I have adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he’s here on the daily basis.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
Soon my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and my son was six.
The immense punishment that invaded me then, of course, relieved, but it is still near me.
Very often he is "departing" in my dreams in a way so precise, so alive that in awakening I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
Last night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm down" but with a voice so real that I woke up upstairs, anxious, and I lighted the headlamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I’m returning to see if it’s not there, I know it’s him and I’m talking to him.
In all parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsibility job, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have full friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him, and I never speak about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been the most murderous month in Iraq since April 2008.
Bagdad published official figures on Friday: 964 people died last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants aid from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to be next to us and to support ourselves, we have the right to ask the world for it because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki told Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will also expand.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki expressed himself at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They broke pancarts accusing him, among others, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to give him aid.
Cocaine lawyer who informed a drug dealer of a police investigation was arrested
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the master of crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the great day.
He was sentenced to three-year prison sentence by the Liverpool seats court
A great defense lawyer, who had informed a friend of a major police investigation of drugs because he was afraid his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sensitive information to Neil Scarbrough’s master of crime regarding investigations into his drug trafficking activities after compromising due to his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was named “Bash” and considered criminals to be a “primary case,” was arrested at him in 2011 following police hearing operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers found Sarborough, 32, putting three cocaine bags at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a Barreau dinner with friends.
The surveys revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police captured heroin and cocaine for an amount of £1.5 Mb, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug trafficking would not be revealed on the big day.
Today, at the seat court of Liverpool, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors lawyers office located in Blackburn, has fallen in disgrace after being recognized guilty of two heads of prosecution injury after a three-week trial.
He admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s fall occurred after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta's home and putting the drug, just 60%, under the lawyer's poultry in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in phone contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant at the Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular cocaine consumer after tests showed traces of this class A drug in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He said he had spoken to the suspected drug dealer because it was his client and he claimed that their discussions were subject to a "lawful privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all taken and a hair sample was taken.
In an interview, he said he had a office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he was coming to call him for legal issues.
But the court heard witnesses that he called for major actors in drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, “If someone has to know that it is not to violate the law, he is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular customers.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing the drug to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this goes beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He blocked the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but despised her.
He was too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed him to compromise his independence.
Ditta denied all illegal acts and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta passed from criminal lawyer to criminal himself since he began purchasing drugs to criminal organizations.”
Its addiction to cocaine has forever compromised it and made it vulnerable to the rear thoughts of the leaders of the organized criminal groups who have been responsible for obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should comply with the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to retreat behind the vein of his profession.
Lancashire's serious and organized crime unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who has been found guilty of the three heads of allegations of cocaine possession and now obstacle to justice, witnessing his commitment to prosecuting criminals in justice.
Let this case serve a warning to criminals so that they may know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after being charged with complicity of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the American Death Corridor, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali, and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.

The classic song for teens
Every time, it is the school client that will be targeted, an initiative that had experienced a lot of success during the previous season.
Through five imaginated and interpreted by artists in the region, vignettes containing a high dose of humor, youths can learn classical song.
In addition to this show, the Royal Lyric Art Society will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes room full of the Chicoutimi Pulperie.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region luck to show what they are capable of.
These activities were added to the lyric Apero, the beneficial concert held in August, with the competition of the soprano coloring Marie-Eve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit body to produce a financial balance that is as soft in the ears as an air of La Chauve-Souris.
Without providing precise figures, the Chairman of the Board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to show itself calm.
Despite the precarity that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long term.
We have stronger and consistent support.
“The finances are in flow and we hope to last up to the 50th anniversary of the operate, a step that we will cross in seven years,” the administrator said.
"I'd say even beyond," said the director-general, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.

"The quick reactions of the police involved and their ability to immediately disturb the situation were essential to the security conclusion of the incident," said the headquarters Bert Paquet in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear on Friday court.
New request for collective appeal against Sainte-Croix brothers
A new request for collective appeal was filed against Saint-Croix brothers, regarding sexual assaults that would take place this time at the Saint-Joseph Oratorium, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, to the Saint-Joseph Oratoire, where he was serving as a mess and where his father worked as painter.
The first appeal was intended only to three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us, "I was in such a place, can I register myself?", says Lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective remedy which has been filed has in particular the possibility of the addition of complaints from any establishment where the members of the Saint-Croix Council could have committed seizures.
Currently, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Saint-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as many of the targeted establishments closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stressed that Saint-Croix and the Saint-Joseph Orthodox congregation, which is a separate entity, have "perpetuated sexual harassment against children" that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological harassment with which they have yet chosen the victims' harassment" and have "being aware of sexual harassment."
These last charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the Saint-Croix Brother’s lawyer, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research made in the archives on this issue by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an ex-brother of Saint-Croix who publicly denounced the severities.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the admissibility approved by the Court, the second step is carried out on the basis of hearings.
In the case of the first remedy, the Saint-Croix Assembly had agreed to arrange the friendly before hearings were conducted on the ground.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the LaSalle district, Montreal, on Thursday to Friday night.
The aids were called around 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself at the bottom of a Indian cuisine restaurant on the Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with the Réjane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were fastened on the spots laid nearly an hour to control the brasier.
The fire "caused significant damage to the building's structure," said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty houses, located on the first and second floor of this trade row, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested as residents of one of the apartments may have to be lodged temporarily, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical assistance to die at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian palliative care Congress, which takes place this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
This is the opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to calm their sufferings, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their days, according to a spokesman of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If we focused on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The President of the Québec Palliative Care Network also rejects the draft law on medical assistance to die.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry is worried about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she regrets.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of palliative care homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie House in Gatineau, believes that the service would be in any way unnecessary.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disorients the population on the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't believe that Ontario's going to get into it.
On the other hand, the liberal deputy of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, claims that the notion of end of life must be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Kenya Press Refugees Controversy of Media Law
“Is it a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask yourself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from scanning the independence of the judicial system tomorrow,” the newspaper said, contesting the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconic and very punitive, and we refuse it,” explained Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news stations and internet sites in Kenya.
He said the new media court would “always be partial because it is a prolongation of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya instead in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians,” he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have “the mainstreaming on the media.” The Standard has, as regards him, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “have suffered a harsh strike” and harassed the bill as “draconian”.
The adoption of the bill takes place at the same time as a train of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the sealing of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping mall last September.
The Kenya media raised anger by the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack devastated the so-called luxury shopping mall.
The police chief, David Kimaiyo, responded by calling two journalists and a media official to interrogate them, although the call was withdrawn after a crash in the media.
According to the new bill, the media will be able to pay fines of up to 20 million Kenya shillings and journalists up to 1 million with an additional risk of being “radiated” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to capture the assets of an offender if the offender did not pay his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere”.
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want without impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenya media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, the politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and bring us back to hunt and harvest."
The Kenyan legislators have been the target of the people's anger in the past.
In May, they took position against salary cuts ordered by the National Commission and restored their miraculous salary of approximately 532,000 shillings tax-free monthly – one of the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Center for Health and Social Services (CSSS) in Laval has caused an entire issue in the direction of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital, in the period 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement departures, maternity leaves or short departures, the pharmacy department found itself very short of staff.
It was missing nearly 30% of the necessary staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the department chief Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to engage independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time pharmacist.
We haven't used the deal, explained Mrs. Beaudet.
We have rationalized or reduced some of our activities within the facility to stop the time that things are substituting.
It's sure we've worked hard to interest our young people [in pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There is a contest of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this hard period, the year 2013-2014 becomes much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity leave, and three other pharmacists have been hired over the past few months.
In addition, the efforts made by the Department to retain were fruit, as the four students currently reside in Laval also decided to remain in use of the CSSS.
Now, it's much better, the pharmacist emphasized.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will then come to complete our departures last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as hospital pharmacists’ deficiency or prevalence of young women in the industry, make situations such as those experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always careful, because we have a medium that is young and we employ many young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always roll to three maternity leaves when it goes well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and there were no pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model does not start his career in cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to incarn Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornography drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two volumes (January 1 and 8 2014), is the erotic memories of a four-year-old accent sex since his adolescence.
Stacy Martin’s similarity with his elderly is striking: a brick silhouette, a diaphane tint and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of the risk: the one who did not hesitate to put naked on the ice paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the Toile: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full extase with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their bowls in the wardrobe, he used X professionals for the most obsessed sex scenes, before fusioning all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the doubling.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has used to pushing his actresses into their latest retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A CGR room in Narbonne is evacuated on Thursday evening
Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of neck crashings felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility conducted the evacuation of the room and warned the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people have gone out of the session.
People were examined and the full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on the bottom of the lacrymogen jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Is it always that the cinema’s management has played the principle of caution and security of its customers?
The room was aerated and everything came back in order.
The film has been able to take back its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images.
Only on the screen.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine in citrus
Halloween’s day, a woman tried to get into the country two pounds of cocaine distilled in citrus on Thursday morning, at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
During the examination of the passenger luggage, the drug was detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three citrics having been previously dipped.
The drug was then transported to the Canadian Royal Gendarmerie (GRC) office that took the relais in this investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was interceptated.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokesman of the ASFC.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have conducted 173 drug inputs, 10 of which have been inputs of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 drug admissions.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese Army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A short-range SA-8 ground-air missile charge would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new Tsahal air strike on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) has not been confirmed by neither Israel nor Syria.
The raid took place under almost identical circumstances to those that took place on July 5, at that time, he was also an anonymous US official who had confirmed a Israeli attack on CNN, this time aimed at the Yakhont ground-sea missiles delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington revealing the attack, at risk of compelling President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has reduced Ukraine's solvency rating on Friday, questioning the capacity of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt securities marks to "B-", which is included in the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one of three chances that it will be reduced again within a year.
“It is increasingly less likely that the government’s strategy allows to guarantee sufficient foreign currencies to meet its high external financing needs,” the U.S. agency said.
The agency stated that Ukraine’s exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities massively use to support the local currency, the hryvnia, falling, the agency is increasingly likely to judge a devaluation, which would inflict its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to regulate its gas imports to Russia, which is accused of not paying a $882 million bill.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with the will of Kiev to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was published after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered from July to September its fifth quarter after contraction.
Its end, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has for months required the aid from the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it in 2010 a loan of $15.3 billion and has currently only unlocked $3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new sums until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, particularly by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new successful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "important external financing needs" constituted "a vulnerability", while covering "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Center for Political Studies, “you cannot expect a short-term improvement.”
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections are scheduled in 2015, the expert said.
The only hope is to improve the international context.
S&P also refers to the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels requires the release of opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Winning the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short-term and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, who fears "commercial restrictions" by Moscow.
Russia, which represents a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of the establishment of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
United States Green Fire to Fusion Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had not received any objections from the U.S. authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world’s first advertising agency.
The merger approaches the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe announced today the expiry of the review deadline for the previously announced merger by Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a statement.
They also have received the necessary authorisations for Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review deadline provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions necessary for the operation.
"The merger is also conditioned for obtaining other regulatory authorisations and for the approval of shareholders of both groups," they added.
The Congolese Army hunts the rebels of the M23
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hunt the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and northern Kivu mountains near Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears at the point of being fought after being kidnapped from the northern eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) that he had controlled from the beginning, 20 months ago, of the uprising.
"We will pursue the M23 and hide it wherever it hides because it's criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesman to Reuters.
We should not let them reorganize because they have tortured the Congolese people for too long.
It’s time to bring peace back.
M23 officials have explained that they have evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military reverses would not change their claims to peace talks.
The latter, according to the Uganda mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
In the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last place in the hands of the rebels to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion saw the day in 2012.
In November, the rebels occupied Goma, headquarters of the North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape from the government garnison and the passivity of the blue cakes of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission to the RDC, the world's most important staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC-major state was revised and the army went to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of war.
The pace of progression of government troops is today unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be touching at the end," said Congo business expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historical - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government succeeded in fighting a major insurgent.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group of allies in Rwanda would be present in the eastern part of the CDC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, who denied it, of militaryly supporting the M23, which was made up of former Mutunian Congolese military.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Ruandai President Paul Kagame to demonstrate retention, a spokeswoman of the Foreign Office announced.
Last week, Kigali had discussed the possibility of military reprisals as a result of the crumbs falling on the Rwanda territory.
Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the city to welcome the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed impossible for us to be a day released by the army," a resident of this nearby Uganda town witnessed.
“We’ve lived in terror (from M23), we’ve been traumatised,” he added.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have proved negative, the Ministry of Health said.
“The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only cases confirmed in France so far.”
Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected to have been reached after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed 50 people.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its production of oil and gas has increased while remaining in withdrawal compared to the group's goals.
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, i.e. $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion per share, i.e. $2.69 a year ago.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters tabled on average a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, rising to 2.52 million bpj produced one year ago.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% growth of expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquid natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditure increased by $7 billion in two years and should reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The profits obtained from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the profits of the production activities (including refinement and chemical production) fell from $45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net decline, despite the rise in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint is deemed acceptable
The School Commission of the Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year a cost of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from two-residence school transport, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Before changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
“There is a mediation service offered by the committee and I was interested,” explains Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediate and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
“It’s always better to talk about it, talk about it, and find solutions,” says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization has only stated that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the emergency shutdown of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the flood conducted for several months by a part of staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "delay the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of the closing of emergencys that will not be able to intervene on November 4.
An official request made "for not to run any risks on emergency care in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also intended not to disturb the PS campaign for a few months of municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closing should still be effective at that date.
Even if, in the APHP, it is preferred to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
From November 4, firefighters who provide about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency passages at the Hotel-Dieu will have all received for the purpose of bringing thirty serious cases daily to the emergencys of other Paris hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of internates.
At Hotel-Dieu, the internals specialized in emergency will leave place on Monday to five internals of general medicine.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the current of the month.
"The Hotel-Dieu Emergency Reception Service must be closed as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4th," says Loïc Capron, chairman of the APHP's establishment medical committee (CME), who supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will no longer be patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," said Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome urgent patients," he said, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior urgent doctors will remain in place, he also says.
But it is to the ARS that it is to decide the close of the Emergency Hospital.
“Things are happening gradually,” said Nicolas Péju, spokesman of the ARS, who on November 4, “there will be no change in terms of service made.”
"The minister lied to us or they lied to him," the urgent doctor Gérald Kierzek regretted.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the front against the reorganization project, it defines itself as a "alert launcher" against a "cynic" decision taken by "medical-administrative technostructure".
"They are beating and asphyxiating emergencys that have been renovated less than five years ago," he said.
For him, “if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
But they are regularly engrossed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboisière’s emergency.
At ARS, it is claimed that thirty "despatched" patients on several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have been further reinforced.
At ARS as well as at APHP, the “new hospital model” already launched since October 7th, which should continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist doctors should also participate in the establishment of a "permanence of ambulancy care".
"Where to go if people are asked for self-diagnosis," Gérald Kierzek asks for who the "not serious emergency concept" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as for the maternity of Level 3.
People aren’t crazy, they’re going to where there’s the best care offer.
If the minister does not take measures by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, urgent doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP adviser and elected from the 4th district, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of emergency at the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reope them if we are responsible."
Anne Hidalgo, PS candidate, recalled on Monday morning at France Inter that she had pronounced a moratorium for no closing on November 4.
If so, she would mark her net disagreement, Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-Diu has its legitimacy at the bottom, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of delay to other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to take back hand in the case of the NSA hearings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
This is the first time IMF and the World Bank have been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked about this, a U.S. administration official said: “The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance towards the headquarters of the World Bank and IMF in Washington.”
Explained under the seal of the anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been implemented in the past.
Another official, he said, had ordered Barack Obama to stop these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given nearly at the same time as the ending of the hearings of the United Nations headquarters in New York City.
In this context, the Senate Commission of Intelligence approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes but authorized them to continue.
The Commission introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are authorised to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the conservation of this information.
UN welcomes new targets for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new series of Millennium Development Goals (WHO), which had been set up 12 years ago to fight poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in the development of “sustainable development goals” to replace the OMDs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, which began the evening in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final project of the document, which will be adopted by global leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the evening of the summit that it was now time to “surpass national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and adapt the process to set universal sustainable development goals (ODD),” he added.
These ODDs will rely on progress made within the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my best to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the OMD.
Security concern in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts falling between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, who is shaking them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public manifestation.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Worrying about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a tee shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the site of the capital Independence on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst strikes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by the White Rhodesia and then the South African apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have broken off foreign investors and the local population.
The problem is significant for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal waste in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion of investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil Valley, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the power party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo rejects mutually the responsibility of tensions.
Renamo stated that the government was the source of recent confrontations and launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamo bastion, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and the accusation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize instability concerns.
Guebuza told the French press agency AFP Wednesday that Dhlakama was regarded as “a loser” who wanted to use “all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo resigned from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that the deal was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to start negotiations again, but with the greatest seriousness,” Mazanga said.
The previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm down the tensions powered by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, an open university conference and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well, and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of election reforms, had already said it would boycott municipal elections in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of the suffrages collected by Renamo has been constantly declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) created by a former member of Renamo, should obtain a greater number of suffrages in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should retire at the end of his second mandate next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He does not want multi-partisan democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unknown exactly what the Renamo capacity is, but it has conducted disruptive lightning attacks on police officers and vehicles on a major north-south road axis.
Most of the crashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port of which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely timid when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations caused by the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, while many are also concerned about corruption, development slowness and the recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the country’s future leaders are the government and the president, and that it’s the latter to find solutions to problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said that people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to roads,” he added.
It should be taught myths and legends to children as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
Thor’s Legend might show that “the brutal force does not make weight to the subtle Russian,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “two too violent, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school,” Crossley-Holland recommended a “attentional selection” of age-adequate works.
“I find it amazing that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have pleaded for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly educational” causes children to “destroy completely” and the messages are “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Saxon Angle and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or done well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known base of what is shown and not said.
One fighter from the Hamas army branch was killed tonight and another was injured by a Israeli car shooting in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources said in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they shot an Israeli army.
NSA spying: The United States is “leaving too far,” Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, state secretary John Kerry admitted, in this first Washington issue with Europe on mass data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and dementia between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time a U.S. government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception of communications and data by the NSA in Europe.
"In some cases, I agree, as the president did, that some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this will no longer happen in the future," John Kerry said at a conference in London that he attended since Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his retransmitted intervention, in the presence of his British homologus William Hague, the head of U.S. diplomacy long justified the practices of information and collection of information through the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and the attacks in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had already defeated many attack projects, thanks to the interruption of communications and the collection of information.
“We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings exploding and people are killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects,” the U.S. diplomatic boss said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we strive to collect information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate manner," said the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured on Thursday evening that President Obama was "decided to try to clarify and that he was doing a review of these practices so that no one would feel misleading."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to blow this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepts data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The journal, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the baptism program called "MUSCULAR", and led with the British NSA homology, the GCHQ, allows both agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.
To believe one of the documents, about 181 million items were collected during the last month of January – from metadata on emails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied anything to do with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while escapes in the U.S. press claimed that U.S. President was unconscious of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself in this regard, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency captured tens of millions of European citizens’ communications.
He even sent the ball back to the European intelligence services that would be involved in such communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern “military operations” in countries where NATO allies cooperate with the United States and that would absolutely not target Europe, said General Alexander.
And the poem extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia called the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a wide international spying network that has also raised China's Irish.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces League 1 club in a statement.
The PSG, the leader of the championship in front of Monaco, in contrast to goals, released the list of players held for this 12th day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply indicates that it is "blessed", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of the left knee when he returned to the selection, at the beginning of a month.
A ceremony in memory of crematized deceased
The Father Lachaise Crematorium organizes, at 11:00 p.m., a laic ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris Mayor, must attend, and will then explain at a press conference her proposals on funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obsessions, more and more French choose cream, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obscenes of a neighbor, it is the opposite: French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they are unfortunate to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose cream.
In his book The Death in Cedars, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice president of the National Ethics Committee of the Funeral, insists on the “violence” that constitutes the cremation for survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence done to the loved one" which will be "reduced to a lot of ashes" in very short time, not after a decomposition process, which "will accompany the stages of sadness".
There is also a "symbolical violence", which holds the "deletion of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonimity" of the cedars.
Why is what is acceptable in some North and Protestant countries, is it still poorly living in France?
“Because cream is a new fact,” Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, chairman of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoize Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited its attempts to subscribe to it.
To approve the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director-General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to predict for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as the one to whom he would be entitled with inhumation.
The Ipsos annual investigation shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether they are religious (53%), or civilians (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of Athenians or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums adapted to this evolution of society.
“For ten years, they are striving to avoid the violence of families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the resignation of cedars,” says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer ceremonial masters, which proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: welcome the assembly, name the deceased, link it to others, call it, give meaning to his death, organize goodbye.
This is the case in the crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
The masters of the ceremony are often people who have converted themselves.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, the Father Lachaise Crematorium has since 2010, on the Day of La Toussaint, organized several memory ceremonies, laic and non-religious, to which he invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relax it.
In La Seyne, the relogging due to rats turns to the controversy
In the beginning of the week, a family left its apartment on the ground floor of the building Fructidor D2, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the situation’s emergency, the director of the Southern Habitat Terres Office proposed exceptionally and provisionally to relocate the couple and its three children into a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reason" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken excessive proportions, according to Joël Canapa, director of the office.
Rats have always been in towns.
The detrating company performs two passages per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the residents.
Since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been made.
The neighborhood is not left to leave, and rats do not pull into the city.
For environmental and public health reasons, derating products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we will not kill a boy.
"We didn't invite the rats at home," the family father defended who left his home to stay in the hotel.
We are soon without the juice and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The quote has been a decline in the dollar against the yen, harmful to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) at 14 201.57 and the Topix scored 11.23 points (0,94%) at 1,183.03.
Sony has dropped from over 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house with flames in the Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firefighters were sent to the 9th of the Hébert Street.
The flames declared themselves in a house of three houses divided on four floors located behind the courtyard of the Québec Seminar.
All renters were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who had many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"The alarms occurred then, because it took strength to attack the building, because it was buildings attached here," said France Loiselle, spokeswoman for firefighters in Quebec.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City was the place where the stand-up was born in America: nearly 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, on the ton of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation has persisted over the years, until it has been resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of the show heads emerged in Carolina, and have experienced great success until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year’s event will be seen by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of Stand Up for Heroes, a comedy and music evening for the benefit of former fighters, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took the range as well as the world of the comedy.
Many of the comedians attending this year’s festival have passed through non-traditional circuits, showing for example shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable-channel ("The League" on the theme of fantasy football joyfully lascif of the FXX chain) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the Saturday Night Live show and was part of the casting series Parks and Recreation, but she is still more famous for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, as well as other single-voice young comedians (Surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedy, but he became a performing film and television director, as well as an official comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he animated a TV Land broadcast called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the Hotel de Ville, in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitively in the comic DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, he sometimes went down a street between two buildings and said, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'd come to live here.
Oil price continues to fall and approaches $96 per baril
Oil prices continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks compensate for a report showing that the Chinese gourmet electricity manufacturing sector is growing.
The U.S. brute reference delivery price in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in the late morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a decrease of 5.8% for October.
The abundance of crude oil supply has weighted over the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, showing activity growth, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to rise after growth rose to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that was not known for two decades in the previous quarter.
The brute Brent, a reference for the international brute already used by the U.S. refinery, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) barrel in London.
Submission of the right to abortion in Texas
The Federal Court of Appeal in Texas restored some restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy which had been blocked by a first-instance judge this week.
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July in this State, which widely questiones the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
The judgment of the appeal court means that doctors who will practice IVGs will have to have a "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, pursuant to his status as a hospital career member, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical center to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
IvG defenders argue that the contents of the law may result in immediate closing of one-third of the State clinics as these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, there would be nearly 22,000 women who would have been disabled from access to these establishments.
On Monday, a first-instance judge considered at the evening of the entry into force of the law that the provisions concerning the admission privilege were anti-constitutional.
But Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who defeats the position of governor, asked the appeal court to cancel the first-instance judgment that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a powerful return, side-by-side audience, with 1.3 million viewers behind their television station, 5.6% of audiences.
But was the show at the meeting?
Approximately 10,000 candidates presented themselves at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, the viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
Why is it so disappointed?
No candidate seems to have actually been marked at this first prize.
Like every year, the first hearing is a wide selection of herb singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some of them found their account.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even have gone to the end.
Behind TV screens, successful singer vocations are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make laugh.
The court blocks a decision on NYPD's control and search policy
A federal court blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's monitoring and checking program and denied the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city's appeal was postponed.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city has appealed to its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to appoint a supervisor to help the police department amend its policy and the associated training program.
The appeal court heard the arguments on the request for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case as it violated the Code of Conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, partly due to a series of interviews to the media and public statements in which it publicly reacted to the court's criticism.
The judge had stated that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, wrongfully targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search programme.
It appointed an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras carried on the body in areas where the most controls are carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of maintaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the call by the city should take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and scan system has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of recorded controls has increased spectacularly under the administration of Independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls mainly related to black and Hispanic men.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
The supporters who advocate changes in the NYPD control and survey program say they will end unfair practices, allow more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine police morality without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police under pressure after police personnel have been significantly reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that it did not end the practices of control and investigation, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Renters must go to vote, as each of them pay on average $100 per month for the accommodation price that goes to the City taxes.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each housing.
We are obliged to increase rentals to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the city.
All candidates told us they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means of paying fireworks for $100,000, fields from $4 to $5 million for the case...
Let's vote, it's the best way to express and say that it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysee
Entering the 500 m2 of élyseen cuisines as made after working in embassies, the kitchener grabbed all levels until he became head, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing by Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holiday sites, and feeding an uncalculable number of majors in the world in a near-anonimity that he only brews today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, degarni cranes and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is the owner of a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was a kitchener in a castle in Sologne.
“I have passed from one castle to the other,” ironized Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manies of the six presidents he has served for, but also of their wives and some of their guest illustrations.
“It’s always the head of the state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus,” he said.
“Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she was coming directly to the kitchen,” as she had banned women in the kitchens of Elysée!
It is unpleasant to state leaders who showed relative indifference to earthly foods, "they are all gourmands," denounced gently Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had “a slightly more developed appetite.”
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the asses returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who rebuild the cheese, “it is someone who likes to eat” and “there is no big thing he doesn’t like.”
The current head of state, who regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, particularly during state dinner at Elysee: "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour."
The last night is almost white.
These people wouldn’t understand that there were mistakes.
The former chef of the Elysee kitchen now, who took a glass Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart.
He said praises.
“Our human side is out,” he says.
The boss will be replaced by his deputy Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been on his side for seventeen years at Elijah.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the flames blowing in the Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The four-home building, located at the 15th of rue Hébert, was subject to three alarms at the fire service.
The fire was declared ahead, but rose up on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokeswoman of the Fire Protection Service in Quebec, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has enabled to avoid the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a large challenge for the city sector where the buildings are built closely.
The fired house had four houses, but no renter was on the spots at the time of the fire.
The damages were totally limited, even if the water caused damage.
A investigation will be conducted to determine the origin of it, but the safers have denied the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Wolf: Out of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese leaves a few pictures of his next film, the role of an ambitious New York broker, incarnated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will distort you in his role as a tradeer.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Stock Exchange courtyard, who refuses to cooperate with the authorities as part of a vast case of corruption in Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort raised an arnake that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible rise, but also the vertigineous fall that follows it.
Without limits, man chains festivities, women, drugs.
Decadence and exaggeration in all kinds are the masters of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had joined them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese took late due to its assembly too long.
It looks like the film lasts at 2 a.m.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in justice in the oscar race.
Coulson used phone piracy to verify a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used “the phone piracy, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a bidon pipe on a connection that involves the then-exercised Interior Minister, Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC said before the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a fake rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “beautiful special adviser.”
He was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pirate Pawlby's vocal box and "plant constantly in front of his door", but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
“The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the house of people hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three ways to investigate topics: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The chief editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Do you know the phone piracy?
He claims the opposite, but we say, “Of course that.”
The rumors about a connection that involves Clarke were first taken by the NotW's editor's office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which were recorded voice messages pirated on its phone at least three times, was recorded at Mulcaire’s home in August 2006.
The investigators also found inputs on the computer of the private detective concerning Ms. Pawlby and her sister ranked in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective surveyed her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about her, Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's fewer facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story we’re going to publish tomorrow, which I really would like to talk to Charles.”
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to conspire with others to pirate phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted that they had committed telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister in flame of violence
U.S. President was expected to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking US assistance to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced in October its most murderous month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, November 1.
In October, 964 people were killed in violence, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations has even a higher balance with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence are increasingly murderous despite reinforced security measures and military operations that have been launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence scares a new kissing while Syria’s neighbouring Syria is in danger of a civil war.
Bombs strike markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the streets or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The increasing disagreement of the Sunni minority under the power of Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unfair arrests, has promoted this flame of violence.
Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, after the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars caught in northern Baghdad.
A large part of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Suni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "World War" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the center of the US Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki interviews, which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, December 12, 2011.
At that time, the U.S. President, elected on the promise of ending the military commitment in this country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and Congress voters.
He pleaded for the international community to lead a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security aid to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic Senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, awarding him partial responsibility for the recovery of violence by his “sectarian and authoritarian policy”.
They also called for Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “the harmful influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses an audience of the attack of Tiananmen
China’s domestic security leader on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang earliest separatists of being behind the arrested car attack that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, was dark on the crowd that was on the famous Chinese capital site, symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and fired his three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Office for Internal Security, accused the Islamic Turkestan movement of being the instigator of the attack.
Many ears, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for frequent eruptions of violence that are animated by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kong TV channel Phoenix.
"The group that was in collisions was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, resuming his speech by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was originally earliest and stated that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained tanks full of gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican surveys on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a large survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and pairs formed by people of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests take care of gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women living together without being united by marriage links.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishop's conference, with the aim of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve for an important meeting on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent U.S. Catholic journal.
A spokeswoman of the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to examine the parodies.
In the UK, bishops published the Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: Army attacks the last fief of rebels
The M23 irreductibles, or a few hundred fighters, were rerunched nearly 2,000 meters of height on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," a Jomba resident told the AFP, joined by phone at 12:30 p.m., and said a girl was injured by a ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the confrontations has decreased slightly," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC rejected slightly the rebels."
According to the witness who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "very spent the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "restling operation".
We heard very clearly behind him crashes fed with lightweight weapons.
From Bunagana, a political fief and last strong place of the rebellion fell on Wednesday, a journalist from the AFP could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source from the United Nations Mission for Stabilization of the DRC, the fights have entered "in a final phase", the FARDC having "circulated the remaining positions of the M23 to delogue them".
Since the resuming, Friday, of confrontations between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the Army, Monusco has not directly participated in the fighting, but provides government troops with decisive support in intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were riding towards the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rockets.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, border station with Uganda, civilian-held troops loaded a multi-rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC flaming truck, to ensure the lift of another engine pillaring the positions of the M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called the rebels again Wednesday evening to "demobilize themselves voluntarily" under the penalty of being disarmad "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without results for the moment.
The M23 political leaders are hoping to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, there is only an Uganda mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without confirming that information immediately from the government.
The M23 was born from a mutinery, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which rejects Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its underground is filled with consoled mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Uganda side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had refugeed between Monday and Wednesday, the return to the DRC, which had been closed in the morning, turned back to midday.
"Tomorrow we went back to our fields, but the military told us to reply," Imelda Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by nine children, including a baby on the back.
It feels like fire strikes are approaching populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of inhabitants crossed the border, some with a mattress on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
Musical comedy, this scene beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, singing and dance productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
It is a revolution: the music in French is a success genre.
Long time, from Notre-Dame from Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts would stop in ridiculous.
And successes such as Cabaret or the Misérables were carrying the aureol of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at Mogador has changed.
Today, these two scenes manage the titles as successful tubes.
The first recaptures this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady, and announces for the next world creation of "A American in Paris".
At Mogador, "The Beast and the Beast" could be one of the successes of the season.
On other scenes, music shows like "1789", "Bastille lovers" and small musical comedies like "Disco" or "Life and Times" are on the scale of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Music Comedy Historys" and conference at the Theatre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for success so hardly conquered.
How are French music comedies evolving?
The offer has depleted.
First, there are “music shows” that evolve in the way of producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year back bond with pretext that you can use almost anything when you have Matt Pokora in front of the show.
Afterwards, we have the musical comedy with the stunning productions of the Châtelet that make us revive the Golden Age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comédies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers try a trace.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "Le Kiss de la femme araignée" or "Wake up of spring" are difficult to finance.
Do we have enough artists capable like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight music shows in a season, it’s a big year.
We have 200 talented artists turning projects into projects.
In the United States, the music comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these careers in many schools.
The jobs are many among regional theatres, tournaments, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The living of talents is as consequent as the number of posts to be performed.
Why are the tours in the province so successful?
Except for the opera, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
Few theatre pieces start touring and it is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Musical shows fulfil this lack.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (freely talented) to show up a musical show is the insurance of the ending of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are deliberately held by professionals who respond to questions.
These shows are very awaited when they arrive in a province Zénith.
The Mayonnaise is risen to Paris and tasted by the provinces.
The show is designed to enter all major rooms in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused serious injury on Friday morning at 5:30 p.m. on the Brussels inner ring at the height of Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
The car of a driver was pursued by a ghost driver, who is free of charge to him.
The ring has been closed at the traffic until 9 p.m. at the place of the accident, the time the road is delayed and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation was hardly caused by swelling as the accident took place at the exit Hoeilaart.
Therefore, the circulation could have been deviated by this outlet/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured after an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prediction is no longer engaged but he is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the Caribbean Pirates.
It was closed until new order.
RDC: Army prepares a new attack
Children play on a carbonized armor that belonged to the rebels of the M23, Kibumba, October 31, 2013, in the east of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack against the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the eastern part of the DRC.
The goal is to deploy the M23 of the hills that overlap Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlaps the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on herself.
There will be only Runyonyi's hill.
"Chanzu is not very strategic," said the Northern Kivu Governor Julien Paluku to the AFP.
Mr. Paluku is planning to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Fief political and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located at the Uganda border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was recaptured on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducible M23 have been rebuilt nearly 2,000 meters high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighbouring Jomba town.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported fights close to Thursday throughout the day reported that the situation has been “calm since this morning.”
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by warnings and were buried.
A girl was injured by a ball, and three others were injured, including a grief evacuated by the FARDCs, the AFP said.
Since the resuming of FARDC and rebel fights on October 25, the two defendants have not given any balance of human life losses.
NSA's revelations increase corporate paranoia with respect to state surveillance
By a beautiful day of late August, a German police helicopter overflowed at low altitude the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German National Information Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. front-post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation led to an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. intelligence services, reiterated in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “them the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a reporter, has begun to disclose his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and corporate leaders no longer know whether to believe the director in speech.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data owned by U.S. cloud storage services providers, including Google and Yahoo, have caused more than ever the paranoia of companies with respect to state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been pirated, perhaps even for a decade, was the water drop that made the vase over.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are probably also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interests.
“Germany must wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is as high as China when it comes to industrial spying and data stealing, according to a survey published in July by the EY Advisory Office.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have been concerned that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believes that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German parliamentary deputy said we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them...
“This is not the right way to do,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn’t have to let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
All other than the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock for some companies that until then thought that China was the highest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have realized that data stored in the United States is governed by laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members have abandoned their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations on the U.S. Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-director, said: “Our customers today ask us a question that they didn’t ask us a year ago: where have my data been stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore that these data must be kept at any cost.
It is not surprising that there is economic spying.
There's always been.
“It’s a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally as part of the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Chemicals Production Company.
Americans are spying us in the commercial and industrial way, as we are spying them, because it is in the national interest of defending our businesses.
Business leaders are usually unlikely to reveal the prevention measures they have implemented, in the event that this would leave the advantage of an opponent.
Large companies have long marteled the message that it is at least unpredictable to recover a free USB key during a professional salon or to leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s car manufacturer’s Board of Directors, says the collection of mobile phones before the board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote hearing aids, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during their trips abroad due to the risk of assaulting the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are then thrown.
However, small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a report.
The United States warns their own companies about economic spying activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty of doing economic information piracy acts behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of a renowned German company considered that when it comes to economic spying, “Frenchs are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “Services know perfectly that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in unusual circumstances believe their son was murdered
Parents of a Georgian teenager whose body was found in a wheeled fighting cloth in his high school, think their son was murdered, family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a trapped cover standing behind his high school gym gradients.
Sheriff of Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy contests these conclusions.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, lawyers representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the Sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics as well as the common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a booklet and they put it in a deadly bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, stressing that several important questions remained without answers.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore expressed himself at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I think there is enough base to open an official investigation,” he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson died of “positional asphyxies”.
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he puts elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Office of the Sheriff of Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia Judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to return all video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
The teenager’s parents said they were hoping that video images contained indications of the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines indicating how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of children in school age suffering from food allergies has steadily crushed.
A child in 20 in the United States suffers from food allergies today.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools about how to raise awareness of the professoral body and the staff of food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the self-injector of the EpiPen brand being the most commonly used – to respond quickly in case of potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
The State Legislative Assembly recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something hurts my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on the tongue,” or “I have a hair on the tongue.”
The NSA case highlights the total lack of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, from one point of view, opens in public by calling the US Ambassador on October 21, and from the other, prohibit the surf of the territory by the Bolivia Presidency aircraft, based on the rumors of the presence at Edward Snowden's edge?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response by the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius convokes the U.S. Ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the World columns in a few weeks of interval, on the one hand, the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand, a condemnation of the Orsay Quai hearing by the NSA?
Wouldn’t there be a wave of hypocrisy from you?
Journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that enables each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by U.S. diplomacy of political issues or others around the world, we consider that, in terms of U.S. power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any way to ignore this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information provided by the NSA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of American collaboration?
The establishment of highly powerful technology interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In addition, in this area, France and the United States have established almost everyday cooperation and exchanges of information, which are described as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French by means of the NSA.
France can be driven, for example, to transmit full blocks of data on the Sahel region to the US services, and, on the contrary, Americans can provide information to the French about other regions of the world, as soon as it was said.
Therefore, the main question behind this case is not the NSA's capacity or right of countries to provide interception tools, or the question of the absence of total prior debate, in particular within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter which must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of infringement of freedoms.
What do the U.S. really risk a degradation of their image?
It's nice to confess them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk of the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this was the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top top of their state, were monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries in which diplomatic relations with the United States have collapsed.
Another effect can be more economical: more and more European or South American companies, in the light of the revelations, reject their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and therefore to the empire of the NSA.
Last element: The vast movement of disclosures committed by media around the world, which contributes to launching a debate on intelligence surveillance practices until then almost inexistent, could drive legislators, including Americans, to re-examine the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be attributed to them in a rigid manner to the birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, authorising them to register a "undeterminated" or "unspecified" sex in their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make urgent decisions regarding a sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to fight discrimination against intersexuals.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, confused and baffled.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, intersexuality is part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term designating people with chromosomes or atypical (ovar or testiculous) gonades or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most U.S. experts say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if applicable.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York, and a specialist in sexual identification, said the new German law “all seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children have an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but that’s not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science that consists of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexuals as different from transgender or transgender, as their status is not related to gender but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and is not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sex characters, (such as muscle mass, pilosity, breast and stature), primary sex characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sex organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexuals and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conform genre now have camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to register male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal that authorizes her to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always subject to controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this land-based Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “genre theory” from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed the German law, writing that “because the world is trapped into a new kingdom where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, we reverse two other pillars of civilization.”
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also said on Baby Zone she would prefer sex to be attributed to babies at their birth.
“Parents’ role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she said on the young parents’ website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had double sex.
And just a dozen years ago, the medical community considered the genre as an ardoise, which can be deleted and on which can be redesigned.
But now, many people question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, from Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the genre to be malignant.
He dedicated the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it can be identified as a male or female being.
But in a case of 1966, known as John/John, his theories led to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a circumcision to make him caster completely, also removing his testicules, and lifting him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “are always repeating this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "that they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn’t really say if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfied life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicules and was raised as a girl.
He was made to take female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he suffered from vaginal plasticity.
But depressed and realized that something wasn't going, he asked his medical dossier.
What he discovered scared him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented her body from producing enough testosterone to allow her sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and made himself removed from the breasts.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director-General of the non-profit organization based in California Attorneys for Informed Choice, fears that the German law “invites to labelling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are worried that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an ‘indefinite’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid she will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to award male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only advance hypotheses.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization was supporting Australian law because “it allowed adults to choose to be recognized under the third-sex name.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind,” she added.
The German law relates to the assignment of sex to birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead to at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammologist specialized in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law will "responsively" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgenic insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29-year-old and is married in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or portable mothers.
“The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so they don’t have to make quick decisions,” Baratz said.
This leaves them time to make certain tests and understand them, and a period before registering “ male” or “female”.
So, everything is okay – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to press on for an irreversible surgical intervention.
“This puts children in the heart of the decision and relieves the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what they need,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels most comfortable – and it’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
President of the Italian Council, Enrico Letta, judges that his government will hold up until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the coalition in power at the Senate's vote approach to dismissal Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview with La Stampa, Left Center leader said he had “closed the intention” to continue to govern with his coalition until the next 2015 legislative elections.
The Italian parliament’s high chamber will meet within the month to decide the fate of the former chairman of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his resignation.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as he demonstrated last October his refusal to cede to the Berlusconi injunctions, who already wanted to make the cabinet fall.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent from the U.S. Transport Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the fire exchange.
Firefighters called at the locations of the drama have claimed to have responded to a call reporting "multiple injured".
“The order forces are on the spot,” the airport says on its Twitter account, while TV images show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a gun," a spokeswoman from the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed a person evacuated on a wardrobe, and a second transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also stated.
The Los Angeles Times indicates that the 2 and 3 terminals are evacuating.
The spokesman of the TSA was unable to confirm immediately if one of his employees had been injured.
All flights at arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza
Israeli chariot shootings killed a Hamas Islamic Palestinian militant on Thursday and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fights have been infringed in this region because Israeli chariots have crossed the border and have been targeted by your Palestinian slaughter shootings.
The Israeli army has been pleased to call for a targeted action in the nearby area of a "terrorist" tunnel by the Hebrew State, crushed at the border, whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama’s campaign considered to drop Biden for Hillary Clinton
The nearest advisers of President Barack Obama have, in the greatest secret, thought to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most notable event found in the highly expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and told Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had conducted "depth work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's avoidance could help Obama to reelection while his hopes declined.
According to the Times correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the campaign and the White House seniors, namely former White House Secretary-General Bill Daley, aimed at measuring the effect of replacing the Vice President by former Clinton State Secretary could have on the election.
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been far-reachingly kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only a half dozen of President’s close advisors – including Daley, Obama’s former campaign manager Jim Messina and former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under study.
“Double Down” states that Daley took charge of replacing Biden, despite their “small personal links,” before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list would “not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in shape, and so they said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the "concerned" exam, Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the reelection campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
“The campaigns don’t spend much money on surveys and discussion groups unless they consider taking measures seriously,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said on CNN he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of the possible change.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “has been aware” of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not respond definitively to the question of whether political surveys had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought he seriously that Obama didn’t know Biden’s avoidance from the presidential list was examined.
“Maybe,” said Martin.
Do you want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first fluorescent ice based on medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a brilliant collation.
He had the idea after reading a study on medusas and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we smell, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s something incredible but we’re still only at the beginning of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200.”
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats the protein, the pH level increases and the ice begins to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice I have ever created because the brightness of the medusas is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball cost me about £140.
But she has a pretty good taste!
The company on the experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrance such as beer, cheese, goat, and gold leaf.
But his next creation becomes even more ambitious.
He added, “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice.”
It is intrinsically impossible due to the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper East Hampton Star, dedicated to the residents of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died on Sunday morning, while watching the trees and performing the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands of musicians who flew the air,” Laurie Anderson wrote.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised to her husband, the week before her death, to take him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will transmit to many people the great joy of living that he had," she added.
Lou Reed had suffered a liver stroke in May last year.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat cucumbers, to go to bed late and to defeat us to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more pink.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single bonbon and I'm sure I won't do it anymore this year.
But the statistics show that I'm the galleous sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on beans, clothing and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to with impatience at each Halloween party, these are the trends.
Decoration should be $1.2 billion out of the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimated objects get angry.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet Daft Punk's space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most searched clothes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's no trouble staying traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 billion on animal clothing this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of curios dogs tasted in hot dogs.
When it comes to bonbons, don't glandure.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion in beef this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucks, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It’s a great news for the 41 million children who go to the hunting of beans in their neighbourhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, don’t tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize beans are the only thing you don’t want to eat, and yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn cereals.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to clarify yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses in the United States, which generate about $500 billion of revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these wonderful pictures of you being pushing you on what your friends put on Facebook and you can’t remove and on which a guy you love leaves a commentary of the “beautiful head.”
Finally, let's talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Citroen when we were young, and sculpting a citroen in the form of a lantern, it’s like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve done since we’ve been very small.
Fortunately for us, the “baby-spot trend” began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pots and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend around $106 billion in citrus, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Butterflys that are slowly floating on your house’s porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million butterflys have been cultivated this year.
If you are looking to make more note, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon to Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg citrus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal defeat structure, which includes £38 billion (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivacy.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the share of suspicious assets in its balance sheet over the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it over the next three years.
RBS also said it would include a provision for the devaluation of additional doubtful claims from four to 4.5 billion pounds per quarter, a writing related to the establishment of the cantonation structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would release 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its ability to borrow.
The bank and London emphasized that the "bad bank" would allow a trace of the past, which was particularly accused of being involved in RBS management.
“We can now go forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer and the UK,” said Ross McEwan, New Director, to the press.
Land Rover announces its launch of a series of rally
The interior has 6-point baquet seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options, including improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try different forms of rally in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for rigorous and realities of rally rally.
We have had a lot of pleasure to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost dog after staying locked at 15 m above the ground on an instability corniche in a career
Ruby, a cocker snake, escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was detected three days later by a person who walked her dog trapped in the career
Firefighters have come down to remind them along the rock to recover the dog and save it from a certain death.
A dog had the chance to escape to the worst after the firefighters were called to recover it safely while it was about 15 m above the floor on the instability of a rock.
Ruby, a nine-month cocker span, escaped after a Sunday afternoon road accident and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend, Becky Hall, went to the career of Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in her career after a serious accident.
At around 14:15 on Wednesday, a person on the aqueous view who walked his dog saw Ruby on a corniche in the career, locked 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton firefighter's house ran on the spots and descended in remembrance to save Ruby using an animal civilian to carry it upwards from the rock.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said, “She was in a prejudice situation.”
It was in the middle of the rock, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the floor.
She did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some biscuits later.
It was a very unusual call.
It's incredible that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said, “Ruby had a lot of luck to get out of it.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted at the veterinarian for control; his general state was satisfying, except exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was scared by watching the helps."
First I didn't think she was there.
It was surprising to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and she had failed, she would probably fall.
The firearms were eager.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We were afraid she would fall, but she didn’t move.”
The firearms were great.
I can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he never dropped Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview at an Australian radio broadcast this week, the pop star said she was christian on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He dropped me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a Thursday statement, a 70-year-old Jagger representative said he “denied categorically to have made advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make a show during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, launched on charts this week.
Beijing Issues a Turkish Islamic Movement
"Support in the collapse of the attack came from the Islamic Turkestan movement based in Central and Western Asia," the Chief of Chinese security agencies said on a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video online on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), expressed himself in Tachkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official designates a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Ouighours of the same family of the Muslim-dominated Xinjiang region, a border of several Central Asian countries, hurried their car charged with gasoline beads against the entry of the prohibited City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and 40 wounded.
The driver, his wife and mother died in the car’s fire.
The Etim, which claims to fight for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, former Chinese Xinjiang name, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the affiliated organizations in Al Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadical disorders in Xinjiang, but its actual influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe’s exile gives Scots the choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the European free circulation zone to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of the control of passports in Berwick and a border of sons barbed along the Hadrien wall.
If it is true that Strathclyde’s journal indicated the potential economic repercussions of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, however, this was not included in the major titles (and it was to be predicted).
No one has said that EU Member States are devoting much of their time to turn their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to obtain from Scotland.
This is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now figured: I heard bobard for the first time that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old-fashioned story.
Why should an independent Scotland actually follow the instructions of Europe?
Why to exchange the London Jug against that of Brussels, particularly now?
Here's the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unite Europe is definitively at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties opposing the EU or fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency win the land.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes during the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the scarf weighing on national economies through accession to the single currency, led many people to think that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has nothing to do with national governments that record excessive budget deficits – that was only true for Greece.
The European system has rather weighed on its members of the exchange rates favourable to German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, South European countries are facing a problem of intrinsic productivity towards Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in public wages and expenses – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper disruption related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for granting subsidies to French and German companies in the energy sector at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a competitive disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all salary gels in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being punished by an affordable American shipping gas.
As a consequence, the rebellion, particularly in France, is one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on a foot of equality with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposes its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy worsened.
The extreme right party of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the socialists back to power to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffrages – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that reminds him that he cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single and anti-European anti-money block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make a good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the single anti-European and anti-money feeling in Europe will unite and ultimately kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the “Europe of Nations (suverates)” freely privileged by General Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I hope that the United Kingdom will take its distances to this project, and I hope that it will make eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific allows Britain to be left in account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland, in all of this?
We can decide to be a small region of England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels walks.
I believe that Scotland would be able to accommodate a more free European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it is to be noted – the political anti-austerity movement that has succeeded best in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Worker Echiquier, Alistair Darling, and the conservative coalition.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging early
Studies show that African-American and Spanish girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that obesity epidemic could be an early puberty trigger
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized in family and health issues in children.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter's pubs and hair begin to grow at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as breast burning, hair under the arms and in the pub area and body smells, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slightly advanced age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 years and a half, while it was 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
“When the breast begins to grow, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear,” Kaplowitz, author of “ Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem,” said.
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what is the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered “previous” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – it’s something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can stop growth and a small size at adult age.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the development rate, the growth rate and affective maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but recognizes that “the fact of controlling puberty can alleviate certain behaviour problems and feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their rules.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” a woman whose daughter had her first rules when she was 10 years old.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from school, scared and embarrassed to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages detected by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years, linking the percentage of fat mass to puberty trigger.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are several explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic to climate conditions, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger pub area, the trend towards a real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of pubian acne and hair is common, even in infants and all-children.
“We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician advice to know how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be calmed at the fact that even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
The Honour to the People of the Brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of Coen's brothers, the Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that began to sound there just before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been subject to a retrospective of French Cinema, had reflected the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
If Dylan was not able to hire Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen, they threw their departure on the upstairs star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the pop planet star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and live-played songs, Oscar Isaac reveals himself as a performing folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilee.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich rounds in "Gatsby the wonderful" for less relaxing clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the jury debits at the mitraillette when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week of the tribulations of a folk singer who is unable to pierce and angry with the whole earth.
He accepts backwards the replacements at the foot up in the studios.
Without a home, he makes the tour of his friends' sofas who want to receive it.
A documentary air
“His relationship with success is tortured, that’s what interests us: a mix of evil, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not careerist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior,” said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and awards in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time, such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the event of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk, wrote.
The film then takes documentaries from the 33T-invasive invasive music label inhabited by an unprecedented old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafés where the singers were producing.
The magic of Coen’s brothers still works by integrating a funny character that constantly passes through the film: a beautiful red cat with a craving look, a companion of Llewyn Davis’ fortune.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled "greatly in Tennessee, bagged by blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar,” he added.
Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "the accident can also start someone's career," and "the more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis rejects any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, “the most important thing is not to let us get caught by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves.”
Gérard de Villiers, the author of SAS, died.
He would never have known the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gerard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times devoted it as “the author of spies who knew too much about it.”
He just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the 198th and 199th theatre opposed to the famous series of spies.
Reduced physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved during this journey with a deambulatory.
And before Afghanistan, he was also departing to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, was sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the release of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“There is no doubt between 120 and 150 million confonded countries,” he said in March.
His Birman cat on the knees, in the living room of his immense apartment in the avenue Foch, two steps from the Arc of Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited a few of the languages in which SAS' adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Co.
"Not counting the pirate editions," he added, designing a pillar of books on the low table between the bronze or ivory reported from 130 arpented countries to place its novels there.
For the price of a cigarette package, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous breast, carrying a gun or a gun.
Inside his serenistic altitude (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat and contractual agent of the CIA to pay the repairs of the family castle, launches into the holes of all the wicked on earth, communists in the 1970s and 1980s, and then jihadists in the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few hard sex scenes, a sest of violence and torture.
“I never had the claim to be a literary author,” explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself as a writer who writes to distraction people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "as the major pre-war reporters, the type Albert London, who went on the ground and returned with real and long investigations."
The father of SAS said, “Making a sort of geopolitical sheet.”
“I’m constantly on my records (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving,” said Gérard de Villiers.
In place, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
At the same time, many of his SAS are often premonitories: thus, a month before the attack of a Syrian regime command center who killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "The Fous of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, a burden of the Libyan rebellion.
In 1980, he staged the murder of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Complot of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic at Bamako", he reported the 4X4 columns of jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I’m not desperate, defenced Gérard de Villiers, I just make assumptions from countries I know well and, sometimes, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to frequently disturbed areas, he was installed for a month behind his IBM marguerite writing machine dated 1976 "where all the pieces were changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page on the pen.
The walls of his office are attached to the AK-47 attack guns, erotic photos and photographs of the author with African warlords.
Regularly embedded by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these charges in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I count a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He will not die and will not retire.
Not more than me.
Airplanes argue about the width of the seats while large commands are in play
The dispute between the major airline manufacturers is angry about the width of the tourist class seats on long-term flights, opening the way to a boring confrontation at the Dubai airline salon that takes place this month.
The conflict concerns the width of the long-range seats offered on passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most shortened by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the airline industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing says it should be the airlines to decide.
The dispute collapsed while airplanes seek to sell even larger versions of their bimotive long-road aircraft, possibly expecting a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing says its redesigned “777X” will be able to accommodate 406 people in more than 17 inches wide seats, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economic class in 18-inch wide seats configured in 9 rows.
Aerial giants often exchange strikes on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls the public directly before the Dubai Aircraft salon, where the 777X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation of a photo to the finances showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Are you willing to accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-term flights in closer seats than in regional turbo-driver aircraft,” said Airbus business director John Leahy.
As dietary habits change, people grow, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s jumbo 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and the turning of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The 21st-century average American size tower is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is attached to a seat concept dated the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly baptized jet set was narrower.
Airbus added that it ordered a study indicating that an additional inch at the seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus’ figures on the seat width and states that it is not the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not just depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities well,” said Kent Craver, responsible for passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want us to tell them what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute, an airplane order race is hiding for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at the market price in the coming decades, enough to make the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters stated for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what feeds the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a seat yield in their latest long-road bimotor models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in 9 rows.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this to be able to house more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Confort Passenger at European Airbus Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers pronounce themselves in favour of a denser configuration, which can go pair with cheaper rates.
“A 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial perspective, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of 777,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Airplane sellers around the world even bring with them a meter to verify the competitive configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer airplanes with high density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater cabin customization by offering larger seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other large modern aircraft manufacturer, experts say it is unlikely that its call to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for seats results, but that it could cause the 777X sales wave to forget.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle’s shareholders voted against the salary proposal for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given his group’s financial performance.
The vote is not binding, but it comes to tears the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just overwhelmed by the victory of his boat at the American Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the software group’s capital that he co-found 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his pay.
Oracle’s boss resigned to a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 financial year closed in May due to the group’s poor performance, which failed its growth goals, but noticed about $77 million related stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire 2013 default year, Oracle’s net profit increased by 3.5%, while the bond exchange rate by 27.5%, exceeding the S&P-500 index that rose 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
One dose of the vaccine could protect life from nicotine dependence mice.
Other tests are needed before human testing begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this type of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discovering that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains an innocuous virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing smoking from having its dose of nicotine.
In tests, the vaccinated mouse to which nicotine was then given continued their normal activity.
But mice that had not been vaccinated were “calmed,” the researchers said, sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The previous tobacco vaccines have proved ineffective as they contain antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so often that antibodies levels remain high that they were too expensive and uncomfortable.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms the liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they tried to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but reported that much more thorough research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a hit of an American drone in Pakistan on Friday, said security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud’s death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officers, army and activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, conducted in the region of North-Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," a senior security officer said.
Last night, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his journey to London, informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Pakistani Taliban Tehrik (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi is not influenced by Obeid
Joe Tripodi, former Southern Labour Minister of New Wales, will be investigated by the state anti-corruption regulator.
The former Southern New Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he had amended the commercial bachelor's policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid had pushed several state ministers to renew its bowls in Circular Quay, where Obeids have two restaurants and a café, after their expiry in August 2005, without tender calls.
It now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former deputy Secretary-General Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the government has pushed to make a call for tenders.
The renters were against and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, Circular Quay companies, which reported to Obeid about $2.5 billion per year, were renewed without tender calls.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Ports Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially favorable to tender calls.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who, admitted Mr. Tripodi, claims a change in government policy in terms of bachelor.
The telephone conversation transcription presented to ICAC showed calls passed in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a high official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under M. Obeid's orders in the Ministry of Fisheries.
“The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of commercial bucks policy?”, Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” said Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but in any case it wasn't that.
Not in any case between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, an official said.
Israeli war planes have reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, a military officer at Fox News confirms.
The officer did not specify what the target was, but he said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel conducted air strikes against missile cargos in Syria.
Foreign workers possessing a 457 visa may have to pass a "authentific" test
The government is currently considering the possibility of establishing a "authentificity" test for foreign workers who have a visa 457 while planning to extend repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent visa 457 from being used to occupy non-qualified posts or as a detoured means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government work document has been disclosed today, while working deputy Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers saying it could offend Australia’s neighbours.
“Failed statements about ‘external people returning to the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historical artefact.
The work document indicates the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes while others are under consideration.
If the “authentificity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see if the job offer is authentic in the case of the candidate being a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the company sponsoring it.
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lanka asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers on the island of Christmas this week.
The nine-year-old man's son went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred by Australian authorities to the hospital on the island of Christmas, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the railway project HS2 for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd makes it possible that high-speed services to Scotland and Northern England will start at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Baron Transport Minister Kramer said the project would “assemble the UK.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will take a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government reviewed the estimated cost of building the high-speed connection between London and northern England, ranging from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the duration of travel to northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of trips between Glasgow and Edinburgh from three hours to a maximum.
Baron Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is on a truly national network that will approach the UK and its cities.”
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it present are huge.
Without him, we are facing a capacity problem of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connectivity is better through HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer Scotland significant economic benefits, but it also brings Scotland’s economic weight into the global high-speed rail network project throughout the UK.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to examine the options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for everyone and complementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I’m looking forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we’ll decide the next steps together.”
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain to date in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to disable their tablets and smartphones during the landing and landing despite the U.S. gesture to complie with the regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their planes during critical flight phases provided they are in a "air mode".
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to access their electronic books during the landing and landing.
Australian carriers examine the decision that obliges U.S. carriers to do an important work to meet the requirements, but said they did not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it considered the announcement but emphasized that the restrictions on the use of electronic aircraft during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“The CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft on the plane,” she said.
The issue is subject to a regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure the continuing safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who had already spoken to the CASA of her intention to extend the use of her aboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve customer experience now that we have a board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology on our planes,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said she was currently complying with the current rules.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during the landing and landing, and we do not intend to change it immediately,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will closely consider the decision of the FAA and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Transporters must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transport programs and passenger instructions.
“When an airline has verified its fleet’s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic books readers and smartphones at all heights,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be securely ranked under the seats or in the upper compartments during the landing and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in a violent crash
The small municipality of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a trap of thirty people according to the evidence collected.
On this Halloween day, the evening was stirred to the side of Pia, where a rise involved several people climbed to the side of the Post.
At least four lightweight injured would regret.
Alerts, the gendarmes went to the place to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded are taken care of.
Singapore’s lenders benefit from the middle classes forced to close the belt
At a gage borrower from the Bendemeer Shopping Center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold ears to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,” said Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore (2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, has become the third loan company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Betting jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as ungaranted bank loans.
In general, Singapore’s lenders take an actual annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund bailer with a subsidiary in the same shopping centre.
However, payroll borrowers have the advantage of not applying for validity verification or proof of wage, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
Consequently, millions of people across the region are turning to payroll borrowers while families feel the pressure that increases the cost of living and over-priced households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the cheap loan fed by a laxist monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-sized families are turning to lenders to fill the difference while their economies experience a slowdown.
This week, the Standard & Poor’s rating agency cited the growing debt of households, mainly due to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore were recording the highest domestic gross product/commodity ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is headed to list with 80% of GDP, while this rate rose to 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuous weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance is that with the rise in costs, people at the middle or down [scale of wages] are trying to complete their income as possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have made people pressing on to put their personal effects in gage to touch the value in cash of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items placed in the 200 city-state loan stores are golden.
People say, “the price of gold is high, let’s put the gold chain in grandmother and we’ll get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest gage loan shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores over the past few months.
The rise in the lending sector is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer store and 15 other stores like this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will finance them using 60% of the 66% of Singapore’s dollars it raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate borrowers have criticized the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that wages offer not only lower rates than other borrowers, but that it also does not directly increase debt.
“Clients hypothesize the assets they already possess, and the fact that monetize their personal assets does not increase the debt of households,” she says.
Gage is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to wages borrowers are not only those who have financial problems.
People from Singapore also go to gage loan stores ValueMax to put gold rings or Rolex watches in gage, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of the company.
“It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investments, or small businesses who need cash to pass a hard head,” says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of youth pornography in New Scotland
A pastor who took care of young people in the region of Halifax in New Scotland is accused of youth pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30-year-old, was arrested on Friday morning after searches at his home and the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor was working, said deeply distressed by this news.
In a statement, the church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, he must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
It will be compared in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes into Nazi uniform to the supermarket before being hunted
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barbed with a crossroads was asked to leave an English supermarket, clients complaining at the headquarters of the facility that called the police, the store said Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain explained.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time she arrived, she had already gone without screwing," she added.
I was doing the coat when I saw a woman who seemed bored.
The people were good mouth.
"You don't get out of the street like this unless you want to attract attention," a 60-year-old, Rosina Rusin, told the Cambridge News newspaper.
This incident occurred Thursday, the day of Halloween party, where it is customary to dress as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS brass twice a week for three years at Asda," Paul Dutton said, explaining suffering from "mental problems."
$325 Mrd Rescue Plan for Tasmanian Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 billion rescue plan for the vague health system is assorted of strict conditions to ensure that the government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "urgencies" to end a crisis caused by the aging of the island's population, the high rate of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding, scheduled for four years, was decided after consultations with Tasmanian Independent Deputy Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our opinion, will resolve the unique difficulties facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 billion plan includes a $31 billion campaign for non-urgent surgery.
2,600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch the delay.
Funds are also intended for clinics without appointment in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, it is the best way to treat Tasmania’s health system,” Plibersek said.
The Minister claimed that the Tasmanian government would face a strict regime for the preparation of reports and accounting.
The State will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors in which it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 billion would not count for much, unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate the Tasmanian public health system.
Nevertheless, he welcomed the government for responding to the urgent request he submitted to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to the removal of Tasmanian public health system from the black list,” Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely invest recent cuts.
But the spokesman of the opposition on health, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is “a solution to fortune.”
“The reason we are here is that the working government of the state has withdrawn $430 billion from its health system,” he said on ABC TV.
We can’t have a government that pulls nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 billion, and claims it’s a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is based on a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborive than it should be.
During France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a couvent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unlimited cruelty of a Supreme Mother deliberately sadical and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never goes into lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narration could also become a repentance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, the supervisory agency said.
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the International Surveillance Agency said Thursday, while violent confrontations in the north of the country were angry, near one of the sites where toxic agents were supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
Announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) comes with a day in advance on the deadline of the
1 November established by the Hague-based organization ordering in Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and fill the ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious schedule to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mutant gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made during the fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in the UK, reported.
The group of militants, which follows the evolution of the human balance thanks to a network of Syrian militants, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,67 civilians, including 6,655 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were estimated to have died, of which 18,678 were fighters of the pro-governmental forces and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, 2,202 were also estimated to be deserters and approximately 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of which were foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that figure since.
About 2 million people had to escape the country due to the conflict.
El-Assad troops fight against rebels, many of which have been linked to Al-Qaida network groups for weeks in Safira.
The Observatory said on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but it did not give any precision.
The fighting emphasized the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors while they had to complete their mission, which is to release Syria from its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that continues, within close periods.
A statement from the OIAC, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all the critical production declared and machines intended for mixing and filling.”
She added that “no other inspection activity was planned for the moment.”
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OIAC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contain had been moved to other declared sites that were inspected.”
It was hard to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OIAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the IAEA Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the moral force and the courage you all have proven as part of the hardest mission ever undertaken by this organization,” Ahmet Uzumcu, Director-General of the Organization, said in a comment by the IAIC.
Now in its third year, Civil War opposes mainly Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaoites sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said there was a massive explosion on Wednesday in an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Collar caused by punishment against one of Bali bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted angryly to the punishment pronounced against the last conspirator to be translated into justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by a executive balloon.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years fleeing by being one of the most sought-after men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in manufacturing explosives used in attacks.
It could be released after 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old was recognized guilty of mass murder for attacks targeting two night boxes in the popular tourist neighborhood of Kuta, which caused the deaths of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injuries.
He has also been found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors have requested a sentence of perpetual imprisonment, though they could have asked the man, called "Demolity Man" for his reputation as a bombing expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions committed by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
At the edge of the tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same way as the other men.
"It should be trapped in front of the execution ballot," Corteen told AAP.
I must live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, charged in a parked furniture outside, exploded just after 23 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He dropped in the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was “dead” three times while he was under breathing assistance.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have had the same fate as the three other members of Jemaah Islamiyah’s terrorist cell responsible for the carnivore – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before others.
Keep it alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive.
To spend 20 years in jail after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bombers to be translated into justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. forces will kill former head of Al-Qaida, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore links between the terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
"He hasn't gone," said Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he laughed at the loss of grief that he could cause to others.
The verdict was issued on the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of weeping this year,” Corteen said.
However, Patek may appeal to his convictions.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but don’t pass a call with their mobile phone)
Airlines passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronics to read, work, play games, watch movies, and listen to music – but not to talk on their mobile phones – according to the highly expected new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Air carriers will need to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules for the storage of aircraft to comply.
The FAA said it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic aircraft on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are part of the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve extensive use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.
They are not supposed to light them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to shut off their planes when the plane is landing before the landing and do not climb them until the plane is standing.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their aircraft during landing, landing and rolling on the ground, the FAA said.
Most new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, chairman of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has been happy with these changes.
“As soon as the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers for this – it will be profitable for everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are honestly tired of feeling like “room supervisors” when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to browse, exchange emails and SMS or download data under 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in the airline mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was released to a noise from an American Airlines aircraft after refusing to turn off his device while the device was standing at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be ranked because they could hurt someone if they were stealing through the cabin.
The mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory power for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift ban on some electronic devices during landing and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered at risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they may potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disturb cell phone-relais antennas if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
A industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem last month recommended that the government authorize a broader use of personal electronic devices.
The heavy pressure on the FAA has increased over the past few years to mitigate the restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., claim that there is no reason for security valid for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become all-precedented.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do it deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communications instruments when passengers transported FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New line aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified aircraft to host Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of line aircraft should allow a wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
Ebook readers, for example, only issue minimum transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those under pressure to relieve the restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s leaders loaded a Kindle eBook reader line plane and made it stealing to see if there were problems, but there was no one.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to mitigate the issue of whether or not the use of devices is at risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from aircraft was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorise pilots to ask passengers to disable their devices during landing on instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of travel industry welcomed changes, calling them full of meaningful arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
“We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopted bird from a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird, helicopted after being found exhausted on a petroleum platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The water ride was lifted on board a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before the Scottish SPCA returned to its Alloa rescue centre.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water ride was probably a winter migrator coming from northern Europe and found itself in the middle of violent winds in the northern sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to bring our help.”
The water rice was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with the UK?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing together businesses and defining what wealth and jobs creators want to see changing in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the broadest and most comprehensive investigation from British business leaders and asked them what they thought about the UK, companies and the EU.
YouGov has surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, overall representatives of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now seek to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU States are staging.
They want to see the government prioritize new commercial ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to start in the long and harsh process of reforming the European institutional arcans.
When asked for their opinion on specific political points – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders think that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster’s hands.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, and companies say that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionately compared to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-Europeans, agree.
Finally, and what is more speaking, our investigation by business leaders showed that a major majority wanted to see Britain continuing the initiatives for a change in the Treaty and the development of a trade-based relationship with the EU, not policy.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the company’s world insists on a “significant change” that returns power to the UK.
The challenges are high – achieving to change the treaty and better representing the interests of Britain would allow a 16% decline in voting for the EU's preservation in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt just one moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiations will make a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and more and more necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in the UK, and, as the conclusions of our investigation show, for businesses this means re-enhancing trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
United States of America in Halloween Colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed fringes to hundreds of children invited in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivals on the eastern coast of the United States were cancelled due to the passage of the Sandy Hurricane.
This year the feasts have been caught.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the Greenwich village district.
Everyone is excited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I could finally put on the costume I had planned last year.
We have fun like crazy, says Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's a good child, it's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan party celebrated at the evening of the All-Saint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the Bulgarian gas pipe opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom said.
“An historic event took place today: the construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest project on scale in Europe,” said Alexei Miller, Gazprom’s CEO, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream should be able to diversify Russia's export paths to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian co-author, a country through which most Russian gas for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional roads.
Miller added that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is launched in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should be started in other countries located in aval by the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world’s largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world’s largest marine reserve, the newspaper Le News de Tahiti announced Thursday, resuming information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archbishop (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Mutins of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English Navy that led to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozens of residents, most of Bounty's descendants, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask the UK to validate this request.
Mike Warren, mayor of Pitcairn, believes that creating such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 sqm2, however, provided they have the means to ensure its supervision, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it has already to carry out the very costly air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, near Pitcairn.
The FAA combines restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on planes – but it will always be forbidden to pass calls on mobile phones.

Life Prison for A Former Deputy Governor of China
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin, in the northeast of China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was charged to have hit over 19 million Yuan of pots-de-vin, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the chairman of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said the first interim court in Beijing on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took his role in March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon was a threat to the Communist Party’s existence.
If the head of the state promised that justice would be as intermittent with the powerful "tigers" as with the "tigers" - subaltern officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former Petrochina oil giant managers.
The most spectacular case was that of the former PCC leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and power abuse after targeting the highest functions within the state.
But the government did not express its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two employees of the YMCA were accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord in a hearing from the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse against children following allegations against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 in a hearing of the Royal Commission on sexual abuse against children.
But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said that he "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual abuse on children within his organization."
Phillip Hare, Director-General, was questioned about two cases: an YMCA employee was accused of child pornography crimes and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education monitor was recognized guilty of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, advisor of the Commission, that he had known the first case but that he was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening declaration was inaccurate by emphasising that "external controls of YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the worst seconds of four establishments during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management of staff was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violation of child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's deficiencies to the safety of children.
The staff witnessed that they had observed some deficiencies, including the fact that Lord stayed alone with the children, kept them private, sat down on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had asked for training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said she was the childhood service manager of YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would be led by Lord “very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.”
The Director-General said he rejected the testimonies of staff that they were opposed to the idea of reporting these failures to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationships they had with Lord had ruined their judgment, making them not reporting his actions.
Mr. Hare said he had expressed his views before the New South Wales Council of YMCA saying that for the organization, the lesson drawn from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not be related to the "significant" by the staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements to staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Director-General of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was a "excess of jealousy" and that it had been misused.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe child organization at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone at the University of Griffith told the Commission.
He said there were “grave problems” in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night celebrating the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his mandate, the 59-year-old made his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade to head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and his role as a special representative of the Quatuor for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find his position as Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have responded, according to London’s Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it’s likely that this will happen, so...”
When many experts in equestrian demonstrations met in Cardiff to fight and win the year's horse trophy, they knew that the competition would be hard.
But no one was expecting to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not at school yet, and only a few months after making his first weapons, the little Shetland Toffee and his poney hit during the three tours with great ease and won the first award, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestre center, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting against men and women in elegant melon hats, he was wearing his flat casquet slightly on the side in a relaxed way to drive his 2 year old Toffee poney around the track.
Fenton was greeted by judges for his natural qualities of dressing uncommon for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton was a gift to Toffee for his 3rd birthday in March and has trained with his poney Shetland every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.”
They stood up against and against everyone, but both of them reflected the golden cup and the rosetta.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy with the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenonal that they wanted to photograph with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the traces of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has participated in rival competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it.”
He walked through all the length of the current track and even though he seemed quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy with animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he will surely participate soon in the event of the Year's Horse – and I'm sure he will make a good performance.
A spokeswoman for the annual equestre demonstration said: “Fenton is only three years old but he knows how to drive his poney.”
They form a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they went on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the poney and the dresser – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud to go.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be redesigned”
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be re-changed, a press regulator said.
The New Express based in Guangzhou issued a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted pots-de-vin to make stories about a semi-public company.
Now the New Express will be undergoing a “complete refinement,” the regulator said.
The order of "rechange" is from the administration of Guangdon for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary survey showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the company quoted Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete New Express remedy, and recommended that he conduct a survey on people responsible for New Express and immediately resign the headquarters of the journal.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities from a factory machine manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he said to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran for money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen’s apologies, New Express published his apologies on the first page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several major suspects have recently made television abuse.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their progress, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year that forbids authorities to accuse anyone of themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the way.
The radioactive steam escape detected on one of the two nuclear heaters in Charles-de-Gaulle, in mid-October and while the boat was in the sea, was "free for the seafarers", but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed us the "inavailability" of the ship until "mid November", "the time to take the corrective measures imposed" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS, a defence naval specialist, ensures that its crews and Areva crews, deployed in Var for the occasion, "repeat currently on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing heater.
"Everything is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can do its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS explains.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not cause anything to concern the ship’s activity programme" to nuclear propulsion.
Let's remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier starts a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had apparatus from Toulon to mid-October for a training.
In particular, in order to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small disaster", surrounded by the reactor's confinement space, was then produced on the French Navy's Admiral Ship.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to find a strong dissatisfaction by the people I encounter: a monstrous revaluation of their property, tax detention, cost of permissions of all kinds, administrative expenses to no longer end.
In short, syphony without limits of our pockets.
Millions of dollars could be saved in order to allow a much respectful taxation of those paying.
Any money removed from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their burning.
In Shawinigan, despite the closing of all major companies, there is no disturbance in terms of future expenditure and maintenance of bottled canards: deficit cultural center, strong subsidies to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to the private company or demolished.
It is also ashamed to see the expropriation of several properties to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
This is not the public sector to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that lakes in Fisheries and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (big water consumption) and the large decline in the population, water use has significantly decreased throughout the territory.
Without saying it waste, the city will never be missing water and the severe regulation on its use could be greatly arrogant.
In summary, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without passing through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for over 40 years by cravates with beautiful degrees for most, and I don’t think a sheep breeder does worse.
Discover a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet per 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they’ve ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on a length equivalent to nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with indefinite warehouses, allowing to easily dissimulate drug charged trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were out of it by passing unrecognized, the authorities said.
The authorities captured 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to judicial cases.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intention of selling.
They are sentenced to 10 years of jail for eternal imprisonment if they are sentenced.
At Nogales, in Arizona, traders exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in the center of Mexico in October, making a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that left the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issued extradition mandate against Assange
The British police issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said she had issued a "remise" statement against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to present himself to a police officer, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extracted to Sweden after allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible pathways under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he appealed against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19, demanding that South America country political asylum.
Scotland Yard “issued a statement of resignation against a 40-year-old man who asked him to present himself to a police office at the date and time of his choice,” a spokeswoman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under caution.
The Embassy refused to comment on the release of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being expelled from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after revealing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks’ website fighting secret information.
How Biometry Invades Our Life
End your passwords to access your smartphone or pay your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even estimates that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a transverse and transnational universe as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this injury for biometry, but are concerned about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Computer and Freedom authorized 774 fingerprint recognition systems, hand-shaped or hand veins networks in businesses, administrations, cantines.
"Everybody can be identified soon, anywhere and anytime," said Justin Brookman, consumer privacy director at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among others, and pessimism among others?
Biometry will rely on new techniques that will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most common biometric data is the fingerprints, the turn of the hand and the vein network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own boundaries.
“For example, some people who work with concrete have their fingerprints very broken and their fingerprints are unreasonable,” says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of the Identity Domain at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the veinous network and the contour of the hand are a voluntary and precise gesture of people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture these data to their insu - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a consequence, research has been conducted for 20 years on other approaches, such as recognition of the face or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to increasing the accuracy of sensors and calculation capacity of computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, Director of R&D Laboratory in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or an iris in motion.
“Today, we are doing research on recognition of voice or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” says Sridhar Iyengar, Intel Labs Director of Security Research.
Unique and unfair marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
“In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,” confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers police services a bag of €90,000 to analyze DNA samples on the site of a crime in an hour.
The uses of biometry are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is the person she claims to be).
The identification was so far related to the issue of identity papers: biometric elements ( fingerprints, photo, iris) must be confronted with the information that the State has on all already registered citizens.
This allows you to ensure that a person does not try to overcome someone else’s identity.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or shop.
“We will recover images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet,” says Dany Nassif, charged by NEC France, from commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a photo of someone who makes the knife in a store, follow its progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerns physical access (border, protected premises, cantines...) or logical access (open a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
“A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of a friend pointing for another,” justifies Cyrille Bataller, of accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also apply to transactions, especially those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the strike of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested at Villeneuve-d’Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security company in partnership with large-scale banks and banks: at the time of paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not enter his code, but introduces his finger into a veins scanning player.
The experiment is scheduled to last for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon come to French traders.
Tracks to Relax Users
There are three ways to make biometry seductive in the eyes of the public.
The first thing is to explain is that it can save time.
“If, thanks to biometry, a client remains in cash for thirty seconds less, it is worthwhile,” explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer custom services: in a few years, a vocal server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And, finally, to calm down by putting forward the precautions taken to protect the databases.
“The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of people are on a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks if you try to move it,” says Philippe Robin from Thales.
However, due to in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts, they are still concerned.
“The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me worried the worst: a generalized surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick, the Canadian Privacy Commissioner.
A driving driver at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs saw inflicting a £1,000 award
A car driver has been charged with a fine of £1,000 for having wheeled at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, was found by Tiptree in Essex, driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to the height of Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to bring between his legs.
At the Colchester First Instance, Howie admitted the infringement of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his permission led to a 6-month withdrawal of permission.
Howie was also convicted of paying £90 charges and a surcharge for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to make the London ball shine
The Treasury temporarily encrypted the measure of capital tax but expects a definitive decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, enrolled a 7 % timber duty for property costs more than £2 billion and annual expenses for buyers who choose to hold property within an individual company rather than timber.
The timbre right is already applicable to residential properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, and represents £708 Mbn for the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and the region of Yorkshire and Humbers.
Mr. Cook said, "As a result of the increase in timber right on high-value properties and the introduction of anti-evitation law in the matter, it is very difficult to anticipate that high-value properties are undertaken regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors opposed to the idea of buying properties in London or current owners opposed to the idea of selling,” he added.
The prestigious real estate – 5 to 10 percent of the highest real estate prices on the market – in the prosperous sector located in the southwest of London, extending from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage of 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in the London centre show a regular annual growth of 5.6% but have been climbed by a full-growing “Internal Market”, the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills’ studies.
Scientists have just revealed how the movements of a dog's sweat are associated with his mood.
Previous studies have revealed that happy dogs moved their knees to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what it was in other species.
He added that as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement towards the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disturbed sweat movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies in which other dogs were included.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take a long time before we understand why their cow sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented to dogs of movies in which other dogs were included – whether a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we could trace the curve movement and present it as going more left or right.”
When animals saw a dog without expression turning the hole to the right (from the point of view of the dog turning the hole), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a curve deviating mainly to the left (a once again from the point of view of the dog that moves the curve), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
He thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
“If you meet other dogs several times, and you notice that most of the time, the movement of their curve toward one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience.”
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and dressers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, invited professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, pointed out that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the dog species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs were turning their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were going easier to a robot dog when his wing turned to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming anxious – the reverse of what is found in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in different studies did not fully consider film animals or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
“Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs do not make exceptions,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their curve sometimes moves from one side and sometimes from the other.
Arctic Monkeys delays concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner’s disease
The rock group Arctic Monkeys resigned a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with his singer.
Sheffield's group was supposed to take place Friday in the Hydro concert hall in the city centre.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting a medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys should also report the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets not being able to happen in concert.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any dissatisfaction caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket where you purchased your tickets for any additional help.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest men of the church placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who praise him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the pope’s election – so it comes to a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistor.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to call the conspiracy of February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of voters will likely decrease.
He said a pope generally named as many cardinals as he needed to reach 120 cardinals and as many cardinals over 80 years old as he wanted.
The next year’s consistency will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis’ election in March this year, Valero said.
For the moment, there is a kind of tendency to prioritize Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will name cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world responsible for examining the means of reforming the church.
In the past, the Pope decided alone.
“Now, François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was “fully possible” that Francis asked for advice to the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero stated that the Pope generally raised bishops representing large communities in the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who will appoint him.”
GM reminds some of its new pickups in the United States to repair seat records
General Motors Co reminds nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually linkable records, according to a Friday statement by the U.S. agency responsible for vehicle safety regulations.
On some pickups, previous seats could have a defect at the level of the inclination mechanism.
As a consequence, the records do not comply with the federal safety standards of vehicles for head support.
“If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the header may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injuries,” according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The mentioned models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of vehicles for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its failing and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the defect pickups during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the information letter to the owners due to the 16-day ceasefire of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% over the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 Silverado pickups and 16 503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s share rate rose by 1.4% to reach $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11 p.m. on the Marquette street, just close to the intersection of the Beaubien street, in the arrondissement of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to any probability, work on the foundations had been carried out in this place for some time.
A mythoian foundation wall has just been built in the last days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim just arrived at the workshop to recover its tools.
I walked by car and saw the wall collapse with a large cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who stays close to the workshop.
I was debarked and I went to remove the big bricks that would recover it.
We only saw a part of his back, it was so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is a 50-year-old man who worked for a coffrage company.
Reanimation operations have been tried by emergency services but failed.
Man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Committee on Health and Safety at work was prompted to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The Desperate Crise of a Obama Elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing the possibility of a change.
He says Obama has made praised efforts by the Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not apologize for Obamacare website difficulties or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the moronity of the 2nd year of medicine and would give me hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s memory of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical accounts of my patients in the evening and I slept, this book brings me back to the time when politicians inspired millions of people and speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with a striking victory, and the presenting newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My companions wept for joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries went to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the Obama transitional period before his office in 2008, he had 82% positive opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it’s like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like remote memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really occurred in the years following the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put Obama’s credit to great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of the “no seen nor known” and the murder of Oussama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after many times defending Obama’s administration in front of my couples and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the edge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the privacy of Americans, nor accusing reporters that reveal the government’s injuries.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the surplus of authorized expenditure during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House’s efforts to reduce the media’s silence are “most aggressive... since Nixon’s administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossible to design a single website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, as the political opposition party and events that occur by random, such as Newton’s massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what makes me worried most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his nomination.
Mitt Romney was a confused and unrefined alternative that seemed not to allow his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second mandate by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we heard about for so long.
However, while the positive opinion index fell below 45% this week, it is even harder to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have been fulfilled.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton’s benefit at the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campagne meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on the right path and remain loyal to their cause.
“I want us to be more recent about our talent,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, about 15 a.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred in the street of Retinne in Fléron.
The 26-year-old, Jonathan, of Fleron, was uncarved.
Despite the rapid emergency intervention, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MEP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire Deputy Clive Palmer said Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy the system.
The mining extraction magnate, which contests the payment of a charcoal tax of $6 Mbps, has made that argument to try to avoid issues related to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial at the time of deciding whether carbon and mining taxes must be removed.
However, Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's girls were willing to take advantage of these policies personally.
“He will have an important conflict of interest when he is about to pay the parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not he gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the election commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the headquarters of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast by 53 votes, after recalculation.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of a re-change of the suffrage system to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact details in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper crayons to mark the ballots.
Is it possible to delete the result if someone doesn’t agree?
Today, having a paper screw seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and would take his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We are not looking for a reward except the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new species of duffine at the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for a scientific mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marais (OCEAMM), returns to L’Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Are you surprised by the discovery of this new boss dauphin?
It's a good news, but it doesn't really surprise me.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of the classification of species.
However, it is not impossible that these progress in genetics and molecular biology challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a genre, family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are questioned due to the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very close morphologically species have been distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific Chief Dauphins and the Atlantic Chief Valves.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this a discovery of importance, as the Wildlife Conservation Society said?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have to deal with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or in a way of extinction depending on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility of recovering from neighbouring stocks.
As for the Sousa chinensis species, the population of the new discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brazing limits the creation of new species.
In contrast, closer ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can ultimately generate the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than to know what lives in the cave of Mariannes, just 11 kilometers from the sea surface.
We spend more money on searching for life on other planets than in marine research, and it’s great time that this changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders of its exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global regulators’ investigation into suspicion of currency market manipulations begins to bear its fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with regulators in the world’s most important financial market surveys, where $5.3 billion changes every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the enlargement of the investigation that leads to the scandal of the manipulation of the interbank rate of Libor.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it received information requests from regulators.
“The current investigation into this case continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a representative of the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file said that RBS had transmitted instant emails and messages records sent to and by a former trader to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European trading manager at cash for currency at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Chairman for Cash Exchange Trading at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that she had attempted to act against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said he was investigating suspicions of exchange market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine the allegations made about bankers that would have been heard to manipulate rates on the exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the dossier reported.
Banks are eating instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of remarkable acts.
The news about these surveys has sharpened traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines in investment bank trading units over the past few years, but has been questioned this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of strongly liquid exchanges, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly common use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost.”
The news came on the same day the Swiss Credit announced that it had sent back a trader working in his funding office this week after it caused a loss of $6 billion at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been controlled," a Swiss credit representative said.
Mayor Rob Ford’s investigation has been suspended, a lawyer says.
After the police confirmed that they had put their hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking the crack, Me Clayton Ruby said he had never seen a "so crash" investigation.
Me Ruby told the Canadian Press to believe that the police had "unknown or minimised" evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford’s friend and occasional driver Alexander Lisi, a 35-year-old, and accused him of extortion relative to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police also said he had observed this man delivering missiles to Rob Ford, reporting new court documents.
Me Ruby called "unexplainable" the fact that the police had never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair had chosen a reason not to act against the mayor.
According to the law, police, having witnessed suspected transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrest the mayor, and conduct a search – even without a mandate.
It would also have been able to request an immediate search mandate, if it had deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Me Ruby's words "of a clear and desperate attempt" to appeal to the media in a case that does not relate to him at all.
At a press conference, Mr. Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute “realistic reasons” that could lead to the submission of a criminal charge against the mayor.
The European Exchanges are down to half-session, except London
With the exception of London, the major European Stock Exchanges evolve in decline to mid-sean Friday, flooded by some disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could denounce its quantitative relief policy earlier than expected.
On the contrary, after the announcement of an inflation of 0.7% for the entire euro area, the idea spread among market actors that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street’s futures prejudice to the opening of US shares rising, after two consecutive reply sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest reply of the CAC 40, flooded by the warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks EuroFirst300’s worst performance, after also publishing declining results this morning and announced the creation of an internal default structure (“bad bank”) that aggregates 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains in the head of EuroFirst300's tops in response to a press information that AT&T wants to study a possible OPA.
On the exchange market, speculations on the development of the ECB’s monetary policy go well, as John Hardy, a Saxo Bank strategy witnessed.
The ECB's unique mandate has always been inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at the next week's meeting.
We are expecting a strong potential for a decline in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its reply against the U.S. currency and touched a lower two-week session at $1,3517.
These same conjectures support the opposite of the obligatory market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court validates Obama’s health system reform law
Great victory for Obama’s administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today stated that the law on reform of the Obama’s health system was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges have validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to sign health insurance by 2014, unless they have to pay a fine – and said it was constitutional under government tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700 pages law and, in addition, considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that Medicaid ' s eligibility threshold should be reduced in the case of losing all federal funding of the programme, was compulsory in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election in lice, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, have threatened to oppose the law.
Vibrating honour given to former fighters in Menton
In the heart of the cemetery of Trabuquet, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, made this Friday afternoon a tribute to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Attachment between Palestinians and Israeli people to the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were injured on Thursday, October 31, 2013, during a violent strike on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday, November 1, after a exhaustion of its fuel warehouses, the Palestinian Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Brigades Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another head of the Hamas army branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a carbus shooting during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local brigades officers, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel crushed by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli chariot and a blinded bulldozer incurred a hundred meters within the territory before leaving.
The confrontation took half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abou Zouhri praised the four “heroes” and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who have fallen by defending the territory during a Zionist occupation incursion in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," the spokesman said.
On the other hand, the Israeli army stated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel crushed on Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7, and intended, according to the army, to "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, Israeli military statement explained.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive engine aimed at the Tsahal forces (Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative due to the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," Army spokeswoman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel hit a military base in northwestern Syria, aimed at a missile loading for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday 31 October.
A U.S. official confirmed a "Israeli frappy" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he said.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that she has not named, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a land-air missile charge that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon", in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had reported several explosions heard Wednesday morning at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of militants and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Dance Dance his two new group choreography: the first inspired ink and poems by Henry Michaux, the second insuffled by Satie's famous piano solos Gymnopédies.
A evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the roof, so white, in the immense space that is the House Theatre, ahead, profile, end like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, a ink of Henry Michaux is projected.
The body, simply character, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a filling of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only their hands and their face discovered, awaiting each side of the play area, climb when the next graph appears, incarns it, descends.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in solo relais, group at the unison (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of written choreographic tasks on cards, placed online on the front-scene.
This is the same principle, the gigantic version of PowerPoint.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be cassure when Carol Prieur will escape under the dance cover, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or retention, part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotone in the shout, and will continue to dance.
And the music to leave, and the sequence to recover.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if possible, ends up shaking and shaking.
As does the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as those hairs that burning or those black tissues that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choregrapher, instead of going to meet the work of Michael, imposed, with his tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
The ink of Michaux, like forms of Gestalt, opens a larger and giboy imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hacked by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a sudden black theatre, touching magic.
The public loved, the hospital was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the entertainment, are richer.
The scene is partially draped with gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a delayed house.
In the piano, dancers are relaxing to play partitions.
Their misdirections in music, touching, give real fragility.
On stage, couples pass into loving duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition soils, sets that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffs appear, also familiar with Chouinard, treading the red nose, in loving men-female parades very polarized.
Love are carnivals, fleeers or players.
The gestull, laughter, and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and ridiculousness of the coated bodies, of beings that fall.
But the piece takes its real flight after the rescue.
A clown returns to stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overponder, cabotinent dances, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, pull the sauce into a distorted disorder that remains senseless.
Joy and madness passed over, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents has launched a breakdown of patent prosecution on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he broke at the pond during the sale of the Nortel patents after bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for breach of patents before the US Session Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in connection with Internet research terms, the conclusions of the trial, which is the core of Google’s business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work under Google’s Android operating system, which delivers strong competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 billion for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, ultimately offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents against Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a partly based market on the Motorola patent library.
“Although Google failed in his attempt to acquire the patents in question during auctions, it violated and continues to violate those patents,” the trial concluded.
Rockstar claims more damage to Google because it claims that Google’s breach of patents is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defected water heater caused by the explosion
Grandmother would have fired a cigarette during a gas escape.
The explosion of a housing in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old nephew, is due to a gas escape from a defected water heater, the King’s prosecutor’s substitute said on Friday evening.
The expert on-site by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is merely accidental.
Grandmother burned a cigarette while there was a escape and gas accumulation.
The vital prediction of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who stayed at his grandfather and his companion, was next to him and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before they were brought to the CHU of Liège, she in helicopter, she in ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who went down to the site.
Traumatised, Grandpa was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
He was able to reach the floor by the stairs remaining intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The neighbouring house’s grandfather and renter, fragile by the explosion, were relogated by the CPAS president.
The firemen of Anna and Namur and the Arch police intervened.
Crisnée’s civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to lend a vow
Mohamed Morsi loaned a vow to invest, but it is unlikely that his triumph day marks the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he borrowed the oath to investigate the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successive Hosni Moubarak who was removed from power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth head of Egypt since the reverse of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore to the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," President Morsi said during the live solenal ceremony broadcast on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have set the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” explained Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer formed in the United States, originating from Muslim Brotherhoods, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and resilient organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and, denounced from the presidential fasting of the years of Moubarak, the circulation was only shortly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy to the very frequented streets connecting the city centre to the southern coasts.
Considered as the poorly charismatic “help wheel” of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been significantly strengthened since his victory and Friday’s speech during which he tried to present himself not only as the candidate of Islamists but also of all those who want to finish the work initiated during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Moubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mohamed Morsi, dressed in blue and red cravate, addressing judges present in the wooden decorated room where he swears.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he pronounced his investment discourse.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national hymn while he was guarding you.
Marrakech Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The People and the Army, hand in hand..." surrendered by thousands of people gathered in the university's great amphibian.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of laic education, the University of Cairo later became a fiftial group of Islamic students in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Tahrir Square on Friday, from which the uprising which ended the authoritarian regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, who replaced the former evicted president, deposed him.
But by accepting to formally lend a vow to the Court, rather than to the Parliament as it is used, he clings to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not finished.
Mr. Morsi's speech on the Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The U.S. shutdown brakes the rise of the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations has weighted on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the manufacturers on Friday, five of the six main achieved performance lower than expected.
The three major manufacturers in Detroit show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and corrected seasonal variations, but the market was 15.3 million, according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst by Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he believes that this light brake is firstly explained by the government’s ‘shutdown’ and its impact on the consumer’s feeling during the first fifteenth of the month.
However, GM reported a growth of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group saw their commercial performance improved compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from the success of his pick-ups, saw his sales progress from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
On the other hand, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected vehicles.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales less than consensus, despite rising over a year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, the GM share won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT, while Ford paid 1.1%.
Renault flooded in stock by Nissan's warning
Renault on Friday accuses the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it has dropped by nearly 20% of its annual net profit forecasts, traders report.
Nissan, who had to make such a revision, also announced a change in its direction.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected by the “warning” this morning.
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a trade manager of a Paris broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and 15% of the Japanese manufacturer, according to Nissan’s website data.
Greece: Two dead in a gun near a neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured by fire shots on Friday evening by two people who were on board a bike that was walking in front of a local of the neonazi party Aube golden in the west coast of Athens, police sources said.
The police were not able to provide information about the identity of the victims and their possible political belongings.
Some Greek media reported that members of the Golden Age had supported that the victims were guards of their location.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police from the anti-terrorism service hurried to the central Avenue of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and shut down the neighbourhood.
The incident took place a few weeks after the accusation of six deputies of Golden Sun, including the leader and founder of the party, to participate in a "criminal organization" in the context of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-Fascist musician by one of his members.
Scott Brown's call was rejected
Scott Brown, Captain of the Celtic Glasgow, saw his call rejected and will be suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and the AC Milan.
Expulsed against Barça for a hit to Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three UEFA meetings.
In a statement, his club said he was "very disappointed," considering that his call was completely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are free of electricity throughout the province, shortly after Friday afternoon, due to the violent winds affecting many regions along the Saint-Laurent River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers flooded in black, the Monterge with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also knows its lot of distortions with nearly 7,000 electrical private homes in the metropolitan and Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its net profit forecasts to rise and hopes for record results thanks to Australian and UK holidaymakers.
The travel agency is now expecting to make a basic profit for the entire year between $325 and $340 Mbps before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 to $315 Mbps.
If the current forecasts are achieved, it will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
General Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had earned 8 percent of profits in the first half and that the second half had started in force, particularly with regard to other travels other than business trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are in good way to achieve record results throughout the year before interest and tax deduction,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the UK, which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebound during the second semester, which made it possible to compensate for a slightly declining domestic business trip market.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre recreational travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
Its US subsidiary recovered its losses during the first semester where seasonal demand is lower and should benefit over the entire exercise for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre’s shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot at a hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown people opened fire on Friday on a hotel near Cairo pyramids in Egypt without victims, resulting in apparent disputes with dismissed employees.
The attackers have escaped, said the spokeswoman of the Interior Ministry, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs while Egypt has almost no more received tourists since the army destituted Islamic President Mohamed Morsi in early July and repressed the protests of his supporters in the blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, writing and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to today.
The review will also present “new texts” to encourage more diverse readings.
A course that combines literature and English language will be deleted.
As of 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education has to publish its new English and mathematics programs tomorrow – the raw materials to be undergoing a radical review.
It will make changes to other fundamental matters next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examination Regulatory Office, will reveal a change in the structure of the GCSE, with a new rating system and less courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “a broad consensus on the need to reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence,” insisting on the fact that GCSEs would be “more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time at maths (116 hours a year, 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
Compared, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students offer about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to dedicate more hours of time to mathematics, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deep mathematics – as well as the greater importance given to the subjects in international rankings – would probably encourage schools to provide more hours.
The programme will emphasise more on the “real world problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July in that State, which widely questiones the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
An octogenaire welcomes children with a gun at Muy for Halloween
Young people aged 9 and 13 were making doors to claim beans at Halloween evening.
One of the rivers of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting gun.
The 86-year-old man explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His gun was captured.
The ex-chef of Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common graveyard of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, said the German Memorial leader, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common graveyard of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he said on the daily large-scale, based on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime by Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmes of the After-War.
The German secret services, the BND, as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was located in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were completely mistaken.
"From August 1945, the body of Müller was found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a command," said Tuchel.
He was wearing "a uniform of general."
"In the left inner pocket were particularly his service status with a photo," he continued.
Bild also published a document from the district district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
The fact that one of the most brutal Nazi sadists was buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge poor taste.
“The victim’s memory is largely crowded from the foot,” he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important characters of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He attended the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was in particular under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroun villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend with hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this country of western Africa, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for the electorate "CNN Heroes of the Year."
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father changing the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroun.
At the beginning, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematome that he would wear the sequels for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroun,” Georges Bwelle said.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in bonded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle added.
You can leave the house at 5 p.m., go to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they are waiting too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroun, there is only one doctor for 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Camerounians could not pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty threshold, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenses are carried out in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted more than 700 surgical acts for free during the last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central Yaoundé hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, who travels to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with thirty people, they sit in furniture after fixing medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult grounds to go to the villages that most need help.
Luck does not always follow them.
They have often forced vehicles to cross rivers or trails.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dance and offers the best accommodation available to them.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with its great smile and excessive energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team started receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people at each visit,” Bwelle said.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come walking.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care are provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive beans, a pair of collected glasses or a free birth certificate – a document necessary to go to school, but many poor families can simply not afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, a municipality or a home; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the awakening room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrical group, the operation room and the sterilization of the material, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It’s a relentless pace, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They hit bubbles all night to keep us awake so that we can continue working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroon doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts for free over the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they come to help.
A man explained that the free operation he had undergone to cure a hernia would allow him to work again.
“This will change my future and my family,” he said.
In addition to making this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering within the Dr. Bwelle group.
He’s always in the hospital or is trying to find money for his association so that he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nurses such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity to learn in the field they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help sprinkle the blood or transfer the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," Ms. O'Malley said.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are studying in medicine in the second year.
Volunteer students generally pay their trip to Cameroun, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their retirement, transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is not close to breaking off.
For Dr. Bwelle, relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
To help others live happy by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he'll see what I'm doing.
Laughing people and relieving the pain are the reasons why I can do this.

The two Frances by Pierre Nora
Surprisingly, the universities have long been looking for to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Without a doubt, but by emphasising his weakness for the crossways, Science-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitration of the works of others in his office in the street Gaston-Gallimard?
Indeed, but by ignoring the hidden work and the subterranean writing of the editor.
Heir of the chair occupied by Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course yet, but knowing that such sacred could not replace the true sacred oil, that of the thesis, of which it has happened.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakener, animator, and federator of their work, but they noticed that he had little tendency to produce himself.
In this uncertain image, the monument of "Memory Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil languages could see a giant buzz market, presented by an intelligent commentator, equipped with a vibrant eye-catching, but incurrently amateur.
The two books published by Nora nearly two years ago have already established that the one passing for not to write had a lot and well written.
The book here should definitely make justice to him.
However, once again, there is the temptation of substitution, intellectual vagabondation, the retirement set to jump like joint feet of one subject to the other.
But we quickly understand that the different objects gathered in this book to such a beautiful title bring the broker back to the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to the national unity?
Identity: It is a concern of time.
We were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the permeable spirit of our leaders at that time, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that tracks Pierre Nora is everything else.
He is not a heir of eternal freedom, he refuses to define it.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he mistakes in a forest of symbols, arrested at each step by an object in the form of rebuke, tormented by irritating questions.
This, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country that is so lastingly established in its borders, so formerly sharpened and solidly masonized, are these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure the trouble born of disagreements in French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholic and Protestant: the division forces, here, are very ancient.
And, of course, the most emblematic is the one that covers two national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but not to deny it; worried, on the contrary, of finding the sacrality again, and of the more avid of unity and invisibility that it had cut the head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation thereof.
And from there, a binary nation, shared between left and right, laicity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagon, so that the American escape of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one and the other made a revolution, wrote a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But U.S. collapse only makes it better to emphasize what is clean for us.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no longer to worry about it.
Here, men burning with an ancient indigenous regime, and even more radical.
This is a consensual revolution when she sowed the drama here and confessed it.
There are always honoured founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors of whom we deserve to be modeled, and who have become one another.
This is an institutional constance, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as many mistakes to catch and try again.
France is leaving, France is coming
There was, however, a time when the French believed to be able to recover the decayed dress of their story, and to defeat the curse of number two.
In this third Republic, central and creator time, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then employed to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolers everything that in ancient France was obscurly preparing modern France and offering them a single version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only a while.
This is once again in debate, swallowed by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the outskirts of France that come.
With, in prime, the portrait of the historian, which should book a few surprises.
It was discovered that the chain was a marijuana.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The library was in the center of the center.
And the one who had deposited, for more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had undergone the initial exercise of the thesis, trusts us, cum grano salis, that he would eventually do it.
Certainly in a less narrow, brighter and subtle form.
But we don’t make mistakes, just as binding.
Because much more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis says the internal necessity of a life.
An old kidnapper in Lebanon: "Return is complex enough to manage"
Born in Beyrouth on March 8, 1986 with three members of his Antenna 2 team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
He retired since 2008 and participated in 2004 in the creation of the Defence Association of Otages of the World, which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for kidnappers to make a complaint and bring their kidnappers to the International Criminal Court.
More than 1,000 days ago, the four captives of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical exams at the military hospital in Val-de-Grance on Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families back.
And try, gradually, to restart the course of their life.
"The New Observator" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages of the World".
From the evening of your release, you were on the "Antenne 2" plate.
What are your memories of your release today?
In place, especially in Beyrouth.
When I'm released, I find myself in the car box where I meet - without seeing it because it makes black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he says, "We can still be killed."
We are very excited, but very tense too.
This is the war, and those who lead us are very tender as well.
They put us on the edge of a trottoir.
There are Syrian troops.
Then we arrive at the Summerland hotel site where the press is present.
French are taking us to the Embassy of France.
It’s time for the first wire strikes to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to talk to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to the airport from Larnaca to Cyprus.
Arriving there in a helicopter, we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on the French floor?
We landed on Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There is an incredible bousculate.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I'm back and it's full.
The downstairs of the plane’s stairs, the findings with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorists pulled the bowl to take pictures and followed me to my home where I had to do a little police to prevent some from getting up.
Media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is as hard to see it clearly.
We're out of a hole and we're just under the media lights.
It's a bit complicated, a bit violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
In the evening, I’m at 20:00, and the next day I’m also on TV.
Then start a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like a holiday.
How did DGSE medical exams and debriefing have been conducted?
I had the right to first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grece the next days I returned: radios, exams in all genres and meeting a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that makes everything but we know that we can count on him, remember him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the occupants.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four Niger captives?
I'm listening to what you're saying.
Discussion on reasons in particular.
Some things irritate me, others less.
I'm trying to make a part of the issues about my past as an otage and my head of the "Otages of the World" association that allows me to get away, and it seems to me much more interesting to address.
I am wondering, for example, about the definition of resilience.
In particular, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the kidnapping.
I think there is a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify for the "political" occupation of occupants - which is mostly the case - and allow occupants to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their occupants to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and is happy with the release of these captives.
But who says that these captives may also have access to justice?
A court in Hague is made for this.
Why shouldn’t people say to the prisoners, “You have defeated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we’re going to bring you to justice?”
It seems to me, however, to be founded, legitimate, struck with good sense.
This message is heard but not listened, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to denounce Morsi’s trial
Anger is in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the Dechu President Mohamed Morsi’s trial began, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underlined by the Muslim Brotherhood militant.
Until now, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a fake trial that a pro-Morsi rises, it is him who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, Nahda massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Conflicts were in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed before Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel Refugees 9 US States to Violence of gay Rights
Since the federal state has recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card of the Department of Defense and to the benefits they come with," the minister recalled in New York in an allocation to the Anti-Defamation League against anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the facilities of the National Guard" implanted on their territory, he said, rejecting these States to violate the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The flood of nine states began by Texas who refused to implement these benefits on the implementation of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5,600 active people, including 17,000 National Guard, Reserve and retired persons.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard on Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2, at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should group the best skaters in the region.
The registrations are taken on Saturday morning from 9:00 p.m. and the qualification phases will start in the crowd at 10:00 p.m., before the scheduled final at 15:00 p.m. and the award-winning awards at 16:00 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical evidences of young people who, for some, already attend the highest level competitions, like the young heroist Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already conquered his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he doesn't like anything as long as he gets back to competitors who exceed it with three heads.
Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists who come to question him about a drug affair
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugging, according to several media.
A video given to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The stakeholder, Rob Ford, has always denied eating crack, while thanking for having a penny for cannabis.
On Thursday, several journalists came out of his property to interrogate him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need explanations or comments.
A case of anger detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31, that a case of anger had been detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise, apparently from foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The cat was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The rage diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"A epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of people who could have contacted this cat between October 8 and October 28 including," the Ministry of Health and Agriculture said.
"Five people who had been in contact with the cat have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, prevention of human rage, given after contact with the carrier animal, but before the appearance of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministry now calls for people who had been morbid, crushed, scratched or leaped on a mucosa or on a skin injured by this cat or whose animal had been in contact with this cat between 8 and 28 October 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
"Being France free of anger since 2001, this cat or mother has been imported from another country, not free," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture stated that the last "Indigenous" case of rage recorded back in December 1998 on a rainbow and that "France was officially declared exempt from this disease in November 2001 by the International Office for Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of anger on an illegally imported dog from Gambie was recorded in 2008.
“Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time,” the ministry recalled, and it is transmitted for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease emerge.
Obama is back on health reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that “if you are satisfied with your health diet, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people have received a cessation notice from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president over the last days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a effervescence in the news” about the suspensions, President Obama urged the Americans who received these opinions to seek a new market insurance.
Most people will be able to get complete and better fit health diets for the same price, or even less than expected.
“You’ll get out of it,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if 5% of the population who contract their insurance themselves were forced to change their regime as their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Allow me to address these Americans directly: you deserve better,” said Kathleen Sebelius during his testimony to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who supervised the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed “unfortunately”.
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anybody else,” she added.
I'm looking forward to regain your trust.
It is an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who pronounced this phrase, while she believed her microcut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly's yesterday session following a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican representative of Missouri, to see if she should join him.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has been constantly asking Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily resigned from government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now praises millions of Americans.
Vettel removes a special cake in Abu Dhabi
The lucky elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the automotive brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-year-old Formula 1 world champion, took off for free trials at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi on Friday, whose drawing was performed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose out of 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a brand of automotives, of its equation.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and he can therefore see closely the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this cake on Friday and Saturday for the tests.
He will probably have another special helmet on Sunday for the race to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his party
Don't be fooled, especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Part of the banlieue" is not only directed to banlieusards.
I chose a map from France as a logo, it justifies it.
When I talk about rural areas, I address all those who are excluded from the big national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in its native municipality of Aubervilliers, from the willingness to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal No.1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he said.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50-year-old, territorially attached, claims today as "100% apolitical" even if it has not always been neutral.
Militating in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the equality values I pronounce in my program are linked to the left but if the right people are willing to support me, I will also listen to them.
There are only extremist parties that I don’t speak.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its program - consulting on the Internet - from many topics that are supposed to talk to the residents of the countryside and especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of building guard...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political stage."For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be fair, he acknowledges."
It's a problem of time and money.
The Bay Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my application and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven heads of lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I have received since yesterday are not all out of town,” he said.
John Kerry admitted unprecedentedly that U.S. spying “was gone too far in an inappropriate manner.”
John Kerry reported a reduction in US defensive attitude towards his surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that spying was "unsuitably gone too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that, like Barack Obama, he had governed on “automatic pilot” when a series of fire reveals from reporter Edward Snowden on NSA's spying activities saw today.
The escapes put the U.S. government in the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Kerry said: "It is unnecessary that the President, myself and other government members have learned some of the things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from World War II to the difficult years of Cold War, and of course 11 September."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American spying had crossed the boundaries, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said, “In some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate manner.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify people that he is now doing a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels misleading.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted on the fact that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to jump.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, explode them and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have well and well prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to get to know facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will go to Europe to respond to the concerns about the alleged American spying affair and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the Senate Subcommittee said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had expressed himself in front of the European Parliament and other members this week and was worried about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorism organizations due to the frustration caused by the supervision of the National Security Agency.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain at our side in mutual commitment to fighting terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat who serves his first mandate, and President of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs during an interview with Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has harmed relations with some allies of the United States, however, the director of the agency said this week it was inaccurately and it was a misunderstanding because it concerns metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported by Snowden that the NSA had interceptated data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
Intelligence Services Director James Clapper justified the spying of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy stated that his office was organizing a Congress trip this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and two rooms.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He said the route remains to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to demonstrate “loving firmness”.
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have applied for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only in the world to spy,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the rançon caused by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, flooded by Shell’s poor results and the next day a Fed announced that it was in the state of its economic support, as expected.
Australians call for jail punishment in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed to the trial and was released under warranty.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first deemed guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 false statements after saying to the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who would control her, had attacked her early on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after having separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she found out she had invented the story of all pieces.
She was detained in a cell of the local commission before the hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment in a low-security detention center in the Phuket periphery rather than in a female prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We’ve lived a moment of anxiety, but we’re hoping to bring it back home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed to the judgment and was released after paying a 50,000 baht warranty.
In Australia, the press said, while waiting, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thailand's judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to punishment that could lead to up to two years of imprisonment and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket by Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to scare its degraded image with tourists, which could lead to a burden.
The French police will arrest the supporters of Anderlecht who come differently with the RSCA cars
The French police decided to put strict rules on the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain established Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, spokeswoman of the Brussels Police Zone on Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to attend this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the RSCA-based move system.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border station to the PSG stage," the spokesman said.
The journey will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had the intention of visiting Paris by other means, the French police prefecture informed that measures were taken to conduct arrests or even watchguards," Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission, 62% of students have a native language other than French.
That’s what motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff to reflect on the ways to better integrate students living on horses between several cultures.
The school committee just revealed its vision of "Live together in French".
The Vision Diversity Organization has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all origin discover common references that are not limited to French.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our locations are traces.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they're stubborn or they're from anywhere else.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects in a way that they identify with all of this,” said Vision Diversity President Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school committee.
"In the transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, support to staff in the transformations we live within the student customer," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research center that will give the teachers tools that sometimes come from the other side.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“There are different pedagogical strategies, that’s the real need,” she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
