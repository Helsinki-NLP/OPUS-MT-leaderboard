Inflation in Europe rises due to food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
The price rise in November in 13 Eurozone countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation was recorded by 3.1%, the Luxembourg Statistical Authority said.
The official forecast predicted only 3%, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian emissions banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing raw materials prices and reducing unemployment resulted in inflation spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain an inflation rate below two percent, but close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation has to "drain" so that it does not have to do anything in this matter later.
In Germany, the November inflation represents a fifteen-year record of 3.3 per cent; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has emerged due to the rapidly rising prices of food and energy.
The price of wheat has increased by 88 percent, as well as the soya rate has reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for eating oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on the world markets rose by 52 percent this year, and last month a black gold barley was already costing nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1% to 2.5 this year, but already fall to 1,9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of inflation of 12 months in the next 3-4 months will remain approximately 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup See Government Crisis
The Fidesz Movement’s supporter circle after the ongoing stagnation has increased significantly to the beginning of December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while the Gallup Institute has never been so low - 13 per cent support has yet to be measured.
In the case of some party voters, the difference - due to the greater commitment of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support compared to the five-year support of the IMF.
According to a survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the threshold for entry into Parliament: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among some party voters are the supporters of both camps by one percent more.
The public's view on the economy has worsened even in view of the previous minimum - the proportion of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very poor, so high - 41%, while the situation, according to another 46 percent, is quite poor.
Families appreciate the change of their material situation after spring and summer more hopeful prospects now again more pessimistic.
As for next year, the majority of the population is counted with further deterioration and only a tenth of improvements.
In December, 71 percent of the respondents judged, which is most of the Gallup Institute’s surveys that the Prime Minister is doing his work rather badly than good.
The French believe or believe 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán has 38% of favourites.
The Prime Minister does not trust 54%, but the President’s Fidesz 27%.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without changing the government.
While after last October’s concerns, the establishment of the government and the Prime Minister were considered as desirable 35%, it is currently only 20%, with the relative majority (33%) seeing solutions only in the election.
For the interest in a referendum, it is confessed that 60 per cent of the respondents answered the question concerning their potential participation, that they would certainly come to the referendum, and that another 20 per cent would probably come to the referendum.
For comparison, "the parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly only be involved by 55 per cent and another 15 per cent would be considered its participation as likely, and the success of the referendum would be doubtless on the basis of current intentions.
It would say no 74 to the schoolman, 79 to the doctor's fees, and 84 percent to the hospital's stay fees.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital stay fees would refuse 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most expensive is Auchan, Tesco's almost five-five
Hypermarkets in the Buddhist trading triangle maintained last year, an average of 16 percent rise in price levels with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article Daily Economy
The usual Christmas cart of Napi Gazdaság in the Buddhist trading triangle this year rose by an average of 16 percent, but in all hypermarkets there was a significant increase in price over 1,000 forints.
Since the prices in food supermarkets have "flipped" already in December, percentage of the previous high base has not been so drastic.
However, it is certainly unpleasant for consumers that what they could have bought quietly at a price of nine thousand forints will not make up for ten thousand forints now.
The Daily Economy’s Consumer Cart in the researched hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, 6800 forints were sold.)
The price of the Unica and live fish remained nearly at last level, but they highly encouraged cruel breasts, berry and also the mosquitoes.
The prices of bread and honey corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
Competition was not at the price of the product under 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Coly double-litered Coca-Cola in a necklace bottle was below 200 forints, so the product was only 257 forints with a backup.
Nevertheless, this year, according to the Consumer Cart, Napi Gazdaság Auchan appeared as the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our discounts, prices figured in the consumer basket of the Napi Gazdaság newspaper were raised by 15, while Tesco and Auchan were approximately 18 percent.
Compared to last year’s highest and last year’s lowest value, the difference was 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s lowest and last year’s highest is 21 percent.
In the forints, an average of 1,480 was increased.
The average rise in the price of the VAT was 1 206 forints with the fact that the prices of the VAT in the Christmas season were affected by the increase in VAT.
Just this process of trade turned out, business houses obviously failed to decide how high prices margins are to be determined for each product, as they failed to predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If a trader plans the speed of circulation of the product incorrectly, the price margin may result in significant gains due to the adjusted intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, the price of the consumer basket of the Napi Gazdaság newspaper was so extremely demonstrated that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the price difference of the cheapest forints was totally 844 forints.
This year there was no such extreme difference, the most expensive basket now cost 1 630 forints more than the valley and also the cheapest forints.
In comparison with the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic rise in prices appeared, which in less than 20 months increased daily consumption in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent.
(This, inter alia, does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistical Authority: it measured, in the case of several basic foods, price increases exceeding 30 per cent within 12 months.
Except for eggs, for example.)
In the latter case, however, according to the Consumer Cost of the Daily Economy, it seems almost impossible, as the price level of the product, which was quite expensive already last year, showed, even in the worst case, the price growth was shortly above 10 per cent.
Mouth suppliers are taking on a stronger position than the suppliers of eggs, and the drastically increased prices have been able to benefit even in international chains.
Hypermarkets in business gold triangle do not complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in three shops are no longer interested in prices.
They all buy quantum, durable foods are taking on plates.
On Wednesday morning, in all three supermarkets there were long fronts at the treasury, as the number of visitors has steadily increased.
However, as we know, the country’s revenue is lower, several international research companies complain that markets are both behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
It is savings on disinfectants in many places
This year, more than 1,000 cases of infection were recorded in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The health conditions of hospitals, overfill of beds, overload of staff to stop the infection do not help, the National Epidemiological Centre prime minister said.
In many places, it is also savings on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at St. John's Hospital's traumatic department.
Antibiotics resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who entered the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infections occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but shortly afterwards he had to return with MRSA infection and due to bacteria in his body, one important surgery was not yet carried out.
By December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistent diseases were reported in the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, Karolina Böröcz, prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multiresistent diseases have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others do not know.
Almost two-thirds (683) of MRSA infections were caused by methicilin-oxaciline resistant gold staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria bear a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, mushroom inflammation, skin infections, morning infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered in excess or inappropriately, they develop from a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics of a bacteria that is very resistant to antibiotics and spreads quickly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of transitional or persistent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight, or in patients over the years, it can cause severe hospital infections, such as row infections or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the top doctor of St. John's hospital, there is nothing special on MRSA infection, similar infections are part of the daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection should not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not just there," Tibor Nyulasi said, "when the presence of the origin of the disease is not investigated."
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, treating them in rubber gloves and in the mask, and we have the antibiotics needed to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients receiving hospitals are first examined whether MRSA is present in their body, but this infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The majority of MRSA hospital infections could be prevented, but current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not beneficial for the prevention and dissemination of multiresistente disease origins, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs randomly in hospitals and homes for seniors, hospitals should control the patients received and MRSA carriers should be immediately isolated.
However, taking microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
In this regard, the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
Most cases are so uncovered if the patient suffers from a detectable MRSA infection, the primary epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for proper treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, or should be carried out microbiological examination to prevent the emergence of drug resistance, but in all cases the hospitals do not comply with it.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in basic and ambulance treatment of patients, Karolina Böröcza said.
Disinfected Disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most often through medical staff.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but serious deficiencies are shown in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by caffeine infection, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under home hospital conditions.
On the contrary, the rooms are often overfilled, the bed is often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters away.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, we can also encounter the fact that in hospitals that are in a negative material situation, they are savings on disinfectants, nurses are few and patients are much more likely to get infections.
According to Carolina Böröcz, there is where necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections proven to be less or further spread of the origin of the disease can be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so it is fighting it everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written the MRSA prevention program, respectively, to reduce its occurrence.
The program appears to be successful, according to the published data, MRSA infections in England report a declining trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks among its priorities the prevention of multiresistent disease origins (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these diseases.
Police captain who caused a deadly accident was not drunk.
The official expert judgement in the case of Captain of the 21st District of Police, which caused a deadly accident, is over.
It can be excluded that the police officer of the XXII district, who killed the pedestrian on Tuesday and who resigned from his office while driving under the influence of alcohol or obscene substances, said the spokesman of the High State Representation of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday after the case was completed by the expert.
The expert assessment confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which had already found that the former police officer had not survived any alcohol before he sat down for the wheelchair.
The head of the 21st Police Directorate of the District of Lajose Kossuth on Tuesday in the 21st district of Lajose Kossuth, deported a fifty-year-old man who entered before him while passing the car outside the designated passage.
(The last nominated fact that the walker was going out of the zebra, in the meantime, according to road traffic rules, is not a distracting circumstance, and the distracting car must also give preference.)
After transporting to the hospital, a walker died.
Due to these incidents, the District Police Director resigned from the office and asked for a transfer to the service, according to a police statement because he was so frightened of the case.
In this case, the State Representation of the Budapest Investigation is investigated.
Attila Morvai has also mentioned that the former police officer has been cooperating with state representatives conducting investigations since the beginning.
Additional 400 million euros on infrastructure
The three credit frameworks of a total of €400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, were signed on Friday in Budapest by finance minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with the parties already signed a loan agreement of 100 million, now signed by the European Treaty.
Also, a loan agreement of €150 million will serve for the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB approved for Hungary a total of €300 million for these purposes, the remaining €150 million may be used later, with the extension of a loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the parties have signed a contract of €50 million, which will apply primarily to the research-development project of Debrecen University.
There was also a 4th metro route in the negotiation.
The Parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed to deal with EU subway financing details, they will return to whether and how to modify the original treaty.
This may happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded €8.4 billion in Hungary, in total, 113 projects.
The interest of the loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a compulsory commission is bound by EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is impressive - the attention of Europe is turning to a slightly preferred Balkan country.
What, where and who is shopping for the cheapest yet rapidly rising EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after purchasing real estate in Eastern Europe is now certainly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the coast of the sea.
Most of the mountains are in the areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast, then Albena, Golden Sands, the Sun Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the surroundings of Cavarna and Balchica.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interests of investors and the central part of the country, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, and more and more stakeholders are also shopping in the area of the low-cost city of Ruse.
Also, the capital of Sofia is a promise of attractive options, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is the best way to turn into one of Europe’s most exciting golfing paradise, so it becomes next to the summer and winter seasons as a destination for travels, even in another two years.
Investors are already shopping in large areas, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria, at the same time, try to change their lifestyle and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
There are also Malta and Cyprus investors here, at the Black Sea and in the ski paradise, there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, the regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Inhabitants buy either renovated properties of EUR 50-100 thousand, or deprived old houses for EUR 5-15 thousand, which are then renovated.
They require good accessibility and communication possibilities, it is important for them the proximity to the big city, shops, and as a rule the local doctor.
The second category are chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase in hope of a value rise in the medium- or long-term horizon.
Increasing real estate in the capital is constant, as demand is increasingly strong.
In Bulgaria, the lowest real estate prices in the European Union have grown by 21 percent annually in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to information, Minister of Environment and Water Economy, Gabora Fodora, will end the meeting of experts on Tuesday, and after the official launch of Wednesday, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue the negotiations of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are a Travel Map of Bali, which addresses the following efforts after the period of reduction of emissions laid down by the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.
Currently there is a storm debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also announced that they don’t want to deal with precise figures, although they are calling for an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020, in view of the 1990 situation.
Another major issue of the conference is whether advanced countries will also access the provision of both material and technological assistance to countries that are dismissed.
The agreement was also issued on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, set out by the Kyoto Protocol, will be conducted by the 16-member Board of Directors, the most written under the World Environment Programme (GEF) of the United Nations - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
Gabor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water Economy, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in the global climate protection efforts and to help the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the 2012 agreement, and is ready to reduce up to 30 per cent in the event that other advanced areas of the world, respectively, willing to take their responsibility.
Gador Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 achieved a 5.2% reduction target, while the 15 EU Member States then committed themselves to 8 percent.
The Hungarian commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our country.
In Bali, a lot is important because in two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would take place until the year 2012. In this case, the commitments to reducing prices set by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately lead to a new system of reduction of emissions by the IPCC, which is also the need for change.
This would lead to delays in emissions reduction and an inevitable increase in average Earth temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences, according to scientists.
The British Army runs a YouTube shooting
British military units publish video sharing videos from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, popularizing themselves.
YouTube first loved the British Air Force (RAF): Special units operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos from action against the Taliban since March 2006.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to the landing, are controlled by the command of the air forces of controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
This form has already received 139 recordings from the British Air Force and more than 75,000 people have been watched on their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defense registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Settlement in Afghanistan
The air forces have published videos according to their original intention of collecting and, according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good to familiarize the broad public with the actual objective of the military's presence abroad.
"Propaganda published in this form compared to traditional television ads is almost nothing worth," said Gordon Mackenzie, a defence expert, "but it must also bear a certain political message in itself, because in a special form it confirms the legitimacy of military actions that the government has decided on."
Americans made a game
The army causes concerns that, in addition to carefully modified, censored recordings, amateur videos are also available on the server, which captures, for example, the death of soldiers: in a little covert, "official" propaganda films, officials speak most about losses, but there is no bloody image of battle.
The Internet has already received a lot of videos from the fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan, which emerged during an acute invasion, but the British army has come to them so far.
U.S. performs the game slightly differently - using a shooting game named America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get directly into the leather of soldiers through a more less loyal simulation.
Christmas will be at the ministry with symbols and payouts
Monika Lamperth’s minister of labour is obviously not sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she arranges a final work meeting for her colleagues, which will separate pajamas and coffee with 2007.
In some ministry there will be a celebration with live music, where the officials will examine the Christmas atmosphere of tombolo and touch.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so they have fun.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year is organized by the Ministry of Defense, but its employees do not expect it.
On Christmas orphans, children will receive gifts of falling soldiers, at Mission Christmas will be hosted by family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions, but also organize receptions for journalists.
The resort spends 25 million in the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are expelled from the Copier compared to other resorts.
Večírek GKM is held in the center of Jövő Háza, with a total of 4,320,000 forints and from six hundred of the ministry employees, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will hold Christmas traditions at its celebration, but it will also take place in various exhibitions and the tombola will also be defeated.
NFÜ’s Christmas was 4,000,000 forints and held on Wednesday in the State Justice Council (OIT) building - there were concerts and dinner on the program.
The rental room was worth a million forints, the remainder was spent on more than four hundred invited.
One NFÜ department appears to be invited to another Christmas celebration: there is an organizing company that ensures the flow of tenders, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG) from the EU funds.
For this purpose, they rented the theater.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information as we failed to catch the person concerned.
Dress doesn't need
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the dance of St. Lucia on 7 December instead of Christmas.
However, OIT didn’t want money from him using his rooms.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The dinner began by the Minister of Health, after dinner, he was able to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the [origo] portal on the dance, no compulsory evening dress or dress.
The Puritan party celebrates healthcare resorts, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
Monika Lamperth’s ministerial work employees are not even officially invited to the Christmas party, but to the final work meeting.
There are hundred and eighty guests who, according to a press release, only receive coffee and pajamas, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for a party.
The Minister of Local Autonomy Gordon Bajnai is simply referring to the Ministry of Local Autonomy and Regional Development with his colleagues.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas meeting awaiting 436 employees in its own large hall.
The Christmas party spends 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes receipts with Swedish tables and dishes.
Since then, as Minister Janos Veres, the PM workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, officiality not only strengthens the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time.
Agriculture Resort takes place on January 20 New Year's Reception, Ministerial Christmas is not held.
The receipt will take place in the Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the City Sachs and, according to the Ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are assigned for hundreds of guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception to which only national foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with a small relief.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not organizing the Christmas party at all, the relevant press department told the [origo] portal.
The price of Christmas holidays of the environment resort in the press department failed to tell.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party held in the Arts and Industry Museum.
He is moving to a huge staircase
The Association of Trade Unions of the Liga, respectively, will establish its stake committee on Friday to coordinate unlimited stakes on Monday.
On Saturday, the protesting public assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the work will be stopped.
This will certainly cause serious interruption of transport as rail transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be stopped within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Association will meet together with the Celostate Union of Workers Councils with details of jointly organized Monday wages.
There will also be a LIGA - MOSZ betting committee, which will coordinate Monday’s action.
On Saturday, a protesting public assembly will be held, and from Monday, the unions joining the union will stop working for an indefinite time unless there is an agreement with the government.
This means that no deadline for the end of the fee was set to begin on the day of parliamentary voting on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament did not finally adopt a law on health insurance, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the challenge to the stake.
However, if the legislation is revoked, the betting committees will meet and decide on a further procedure.
According to the Monday agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible to vote on the Health Insurance Act only in late evenings or, if possible, at night.
Due to serious interruptions of transport on the rail on Monday, it can be counted: work on the rail will be stopped for an indefinite time, in the morning a part of the public transport in Budapest can be stopped and more than half of Volán companies can be stopped.
At the same time, it will also be possible to close half of the road in many places in the country.
Several unions and civilian organizations have joined the challenge, whose list is constantly updated on the League websites.
Some organizations have notified the default for an indefinite time, while others have declared temporary suspension of the work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Road (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Staff (VDSZ) were unable to agree either on sufficient services, while more and more people travel through the railway at the beginning of Christmas holidays.
According to current communications, from the start of the operation to 13 hours, the BKV will be held from 7 to 9 hours in the morning at Budapest Airport, a four-hour stand will be organized by the Union of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, to 2 to 2 to 8 hours, respectively, by the Union of Pedagogs and the Democratic Union of the Union of Pedagogs.
The Association of Hungarian doctors will be held in exchange throughout the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), which is part of the Co-operation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), organizing a two-hour warning stand.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government revokes the proposal for health insurance reform and submits a new concept to the public.
The second requirement is that a new method of calculating pensions is introduced gradually from next year.
Thirdly, in order to ensure that an early retirement for the relevant labour sectors is possible to be included in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Union of Railway Staff (Independent Union of Railway Staff Association, VDSZ), falling under the Liga Trade Union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport relating to rail divisions, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
The activities of the Hungarian guards, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországer movement in August this year, according to the Political Capital Institute’s Risk Analysing Division, have immediately increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region.
The company’s “risk warning” states that, in connection with the Hungarian guard’s activities, it is the greatest political risk that “the closure of the already existing ethnic tension between the Roman and Non-Roman population of Hungary can even occur in a short time.”
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such action - the research institute provides.
As it writes, it can be explained to one of the biggest disasters of Hungarian politicians: "The public debate on the Rome issue was left by representatives of the public life to representatives of radical and extremist political assemblies that could build a political strategy on the Roman-Hungarian opposition."
This problem deepens, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the Hungarian Guard’s activity, according to the research institute, has been influenced by the great attention of domestic and foreign media “to a large extent devastated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity.”
The Institute reminds us: a part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which has become increasingly popular since autumn 2006, is the fact that several organizations have been established in Hungary since 2007, which themselves are called the “national defence associations”.
"The common characteristic of these groups is that they themselves define themselves as civilian associations, while they openly declare - and also armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of living disasters, land attacks, disruption of order), further with a point of inability of the police, the army, or the state."
It also notes that all this is happening in a way that is trying to pack the various political efforts set up to resist society to politics and parties in civil clothing.
Consequently, the emphasis on civility and the form of the union does not only serve to avoid legal entry, but also to be a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also an increase in risk from the point of view of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian guard has immediately pointed out in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, and ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries have appealed to the creation of the Hungarian guards to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policy.
This can affect the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the Research Institute, the formation of Hungarian guards in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so the political risks for the area as a whole have increased.
The Hungarian Guard’s activity is similar to the Bulgarian National Guard’s activities, which was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
On the background of the formation of the Bulgarian guards stands mass Roma worries, which broke out in one of the Sofian neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to establish a guard with the aim of the organization to be "national defence".
In the past 17 years, it says that there has been a "Cicanian terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and irrevocable, the Institute of Political Capital reminds.
He added that the initiative has led to a storm discussion of the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Roman organizations that they will create their own guards for the sign of resistance.
Since the Hungarian guard’s current activity shows similarities to the Bulgarian national guard’s activity, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Romans respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own home, we can read in the risk alert developed by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute: risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued annually and if they find out something that could affect the risk change, they inform public opinions, such as in this case making risk alerts.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, the days of the waves are precisely laid down by law, and it has already become a general practice that around the holidays are moving working days, which is less awaiting us in the next year.
The holidays are not united in the European Union or in the United States.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and the working days of rest.
Workdays of rest are usually considered to be church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the New Year is working day - for the New Year already so that people can rest after Silvester.
Over the course of the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The National Festival is the 15th March celebrating the Revolution of 1848 and 23th October, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, the 1st May work, the 1st and 2st November, we remember the dead relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays of Easter, Holidays and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays are rarely part of the weekend, the practice of moving a working day has occurred if we were working only one day before or after a holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that we stay at work and school last Saturdays.
When we work on the day that precedes or follows the holiday immediately, the Minister of Labour has arranged for many years in a special statement.
The law shall apply to all employers and their employees, to public employees and to persons in public service.
However, it does not concern companies or institutions that are in operation without interruption or functioning even in the days of rest.
This year, there will only be a change in the work schedule at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because, according to the experience of the present, most people of the days between Christmas and Silvestre are "working" in advance or using it in a spared holiday.
A few of our holidays will fall in the middle of the next year, respectively, for the weekend, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar turns around the work holiday so that the workers can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day so that it may be Friday, May 2, a rest day.
The next move is related to the holiday of October 23: Saturday 18 October will work instead of Friday 24.
At the end of the year, however, it will be able to take place entirely on the mark of the holidays, since since December 24 they will have a non-stop holiday almost everywhere, although Silvestr appears to be on Wednesday.
Six scary little ones that you can angry your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost never notice: all of this “returns” everyday workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these little discomforts, or put your gloves and unclear situations that others can break, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," the colleague told you.
That's why you've missed the property?
In a better case, he regrets and attempts to correct it, calls the marketing department, and says that the message has forgotten to send (this is less common solution).
Most often, the thing is solved with an apology.
Before an embarrassing apology occurs, it is good to think about what you could prepare for your colleagues unpleasant moments, and deliberately try to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more unpleasant than when you download for some writing, office need or for your phone, and they are not there.
You remember that you put a screwboard on the table yesterday, but it's gone in the morning?
Or have you discovered your pen on the table of some of your colleagues that you thought you were lost?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without your permission, otherwise they will be angry with you to rob them in matters.
Don’t take a cover or a sticker from your office because it may be uncomfortable when you arrive early, and you will need them immediately.
Drby about the private life of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop spreading clips.
Who, who was he doing with?
Where and why?
Don’t take care of everybody’s nose of your messages about the private life of your colleagues!
If one of them shares their innerest secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Close in yourself what you have heard, and do not try it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his things.
Are you unreasonable to declare your absence?
If you call the office and call for severe headache, you will notify your absence because it’s not good for you, or you’re saying that you’d prefer to rest today, think that your work, immediate tasks and work that have a certain deadline, someone else will have to do for you.
Take a look at your colleagues!
If you know beforehand that you don’t go to work the next day or that something can happen because you have to stay at home, declare that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
Consumption, hunting, phone calling
Have you been proud of the work from which your colleagues will hardly get rid of you?
Did you unwillingly become a witness of a telephone interview that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not discourage your co-workers with abuse, singing, loud calling (I am above the head), or dumb, constant leather, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even when they aren’t avoided in any project (writing, planning, organization).
You blame someone else's mistakes?
If there is nothing in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, don’t blame someone else’s memory!
Don’t appeal to any chaos in the office and noise colleagues!
Recognize if you were wrong and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask yourself how you could fix the thing, fix the displeasure!
Do you feel like at home in the office?
Heat and pockets: comfortable clothing at home, but it doesn't fit in the office!
Don’t wear clothes for your free time, even if your profession allows it!
Don’t be worried, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in ordinary clothes - and if your profession requires it, beautiful and elegant!
When a person wants to fit, he stops being interesting.
Dining in the usual morning sausage.
The radio calls a special melody: the sound of the foam to which the electronic effects are connected.
I add voice.
Music changes the pace and the previous tone coloring is added to bass, then the female assembly joins as a real cloth.
On the station mr2 sounds the song of the Zagar group called Wings of Love.
Home music hasn’t long denied us with a quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the clip looks quite different because you're just listening to the new Zagar album.
The revelation of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the overall image, and although it is again in fashion a garage rock with its milk to the guitar, even the home electropop proves there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in Pentecost, and he also played in Yonderboy's chapel, until finally - perhaps because two grandchildren didn't go into one line - released their own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) as well as music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to broadcast until he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
French Turkish film "Season".
His formation, playing at the beginning in smaller clubs, recognized a broader audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first 2002 album among the fifty most important home desks and declared Zagar at Yonderboie to be the only home entities to determine the developments that could be stores and in the West.
Zagar and his chapel are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one asked them if they are satisfied with this label.
Kapela reacted as it was: she made a new, better album.
Now released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new routes to them, although the name itself is trying to create a succession with the initial flights in Pentecostella.
This is one of the songs of the old band Balázse Zságera.
A reference to the etheric, flying would be on the spot, but next to the etheric breath of this music now appeared – according to the spirit, the trend of the time – a sounder guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who is currently working with the band The Puzzle in England, was presented at the premiere in Millenàris Park.
The album also produced a real radio hit, thanks to Mr2 Petőfi station, which plays last night from the morning to the evening popular music, we began to play the interactive songs of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is okay (?).
The website has been told by Balzase Zságera.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is how much the music you play remains?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of play music doesn’t mean much for me.
I think there are two different casts of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, nothing say, and just that is how it can occur only because of sales, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can come from honest internal needs.
In this spirit, the attitude as accepted, regardless of language and national borders, works.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: Overseas, especially from us to the west, light music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people for twenty, but also older ones for concerts.
Many more watch the changes of light music around them, as they also consider it to be part of modern culture.
Hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
What do you think about who, where and in how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen rather in concerts, where mutual influence is already working, but it is only hidden in unreasonable changes in the moment.
However, I noticed that when a person wants to match the audience, it has ceased to be interesting since then.
hvg.hu: How much do you want to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He worked solitary and built his career rather than western.
B. Z.: In fact, we are not on his way, regardless of whether our music is sometimes trying to explain it.
We are team players who rely on the musical presence of others and leave them to develop.
Initially, of course, it was not possible to avoid our work from comparing the songs of Yonderboie, because some of us separated from his team and went on a different way.
hvg.co.uk: In the toplist of the station mr2 Petőfi got the song Wings of Love first.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Have you been consciously open to the broader layers?
B.Z.: We didn’t plan to write a hit to sell the board.
There's much more in that song.
We thought of it as the final album we tried to release the previous audio orgy and more complex themes.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea to make this assembly of soloist home music scenes with a good voice.
Thus, this six-sectional assembly was gathered together - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peter, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized on Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: That's exactly how you thought of the song, or did the girls make something about it?
B.Z.: The storage has long existed in the instrumental version, when the material then came up on the board, we thought it would be necessary for this song.
The tracking of the accords led to joining the singing party.
That night, I sang a song to him, which the girls later taught.
It was almost the first time and terribly spontaneously.
I remember how this revived, but of course Divy needed it.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so much.
Hvg.hu: Both at the table and at the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don’t have solos (except Judy Jay), they don’t have their own roles, they sing completely together, and they don’t have noises than music, so music just doesn’t accompany their songs.
They were also standing behind the fence.
It's intentionally?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing behind was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to divide the solo roles is intentional.
This song is also about forgotten a little about our ego, from where he belongs, to where he belongs, and to let only those wings, wings of love rise up.
I wish that the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
Hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
B.Z.: In fact, during the composition of music, even with one, harder pieces occurred rather when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a concert ring, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he long had not wanted to run the groves, then he found everything very slowly his place as in some composite.
hvg.hu: What song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Z.: This is still changing by the concert, even if I've already "released" the table.
Now is to Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The betrayer risked billions of less-value
Prosperous defraudant.
This is how he designates his admirable employee Jeroma Kerviela, the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Commercial Bank.
It was about five billion euros for him.
But rather, Kerviel seemed to be just a big player who wanted to deal with his colleagues and certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banking homes, he noticed the early crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's mentally weaker," he shouted from his mouth of the supervisors, who sent him to the police.
However, as it appears in the statement by the French media, such as Le Monde newspaper, it was the person who had a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his stores at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the U.S. crisis.
He felt the chance already at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime hypotheses provided to low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems will have problems.
This crisis had no impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profits grew up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Before I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he hasn't left anything for himself.
In all the hearing he admits that he fake records in such a way that he does not come to him.
He even managed to shake his boss, even though he began to be interested in the Eurex Stock Exchange of his stores.
Risk was profit
He was afraid he would come to him?
No, no.
“I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy it.”
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the General Society in 2000 after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“Already in my first speech in 2005, I knew they were paying for me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development,” Kerviel told researchers.
But shortly after the departure, the first great success came.
Allianz earned half a billion euros in the London bomb attacks thanks to his shares.
And that was the launching mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the boss said they knew about everything.
"When I made money, they opened their eyes."
The morning came at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cool it.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank reported that it had lost five billion euros.
How did they get to him?
He became a suspect for his vacation.
“I have only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who has no leave is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look at him in his records,” Kerviel said.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government yesterday signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic can earn €14 billion in the next few years (about €365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion krones will go from seven operational programs to the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion krone from the entrepreneurship and innovation program.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
Transport is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
These funds will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will finance 90.8 billion kroon next year.
The entrepreneurship and innovation program aims to serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain funding for innovation entrepreneurship.
Companies should gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, and also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
To date, funding from the EU funds is one of the least successful countries in the newly accepted countries.
Twenty-year punishment for President Nicaragua confirmed court
The appeal court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed a 20-year punishment for former President of the country, Arnold Aleman, who was sentenced in 2003 for financial frauds of $100 million (without $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison at his hacienda near the metropolis of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state returns from 1997 to 2002 to the net, it is not clear, according to the AP.
According to the president of the appeal court Ileany Pérez, he will now be concerned with prison agents whether they will allow Aleman to serve his punishment at home, or he will go into prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to foreign business accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional and accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of these funds then ended in a fund that German funded for financing his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget set up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
Last year he was still with the support of the Czechoslovakia, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the Czechoslovakia could not allow his unacceptance.
Unlike the disruptive debate before voting on the disrespect of the government, nothing dramatically has been done this time.
The parliamentary House, which is traditionally overlooked, although most influential, approved the law in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether it is a person who likes it or does not like it.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the powerful competition of the government with the opposition.
This is more grateful in the media, and therefore it is much more focused on the media.
Political arguments are much more interesting to the public than strict numbers.
The state budgets in the past social-democratic governments suffered three disasters that they could not resolve for 2008 at once:
The first of them is a high share of the law of mandatory expenditure, which is not only pensions, but also social benefits, which last year before elections had been approved by the silent "collections" of the Czech Republic and the KSČM.
The second one is deficit management as a result of the need for the first.
The third limit is the public finance deficit, i.e. the urban and municipal budget deficit.
This is the biggest risk, however, not the deficit of the state budget.
It is public and relatively under control.
A timely bomb, however, is a deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to taxes, fees and loans from banks, acquire additional investment resources, often issue bonds that their mayors debted disproportionately.
In recent years, they were able to pay these debts by mass sales of energy shares and other distribution networks that they received from the state in privatization.
They no longer have this source.
If we keep only official and verified facts, we will find out that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been through for several years, a growth phase, constantly praised by the CSD.
It was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state was increasingly debting.
Other countries, including a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were much more reasonable than our republic.
It is a huge shame that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that, globally, are at least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have been completely unnecessary in the last years into gigantic dimensions.
Although some of the unfair populist expenditure approved this year before the elections has been canceled, if the limits of retirement and pension reform will not be moved soon, then any policy in this country will actually end, and no matter whoever governs it will be, it will be just an administration.
With a small deal of agreement, it can be said that government policymakers will become officials, mechanically sharing the majority of taxed money on pensions and social benefits.
This year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the expenditure of normal expenditure by mandatory expenditure.
A planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be totally unnecessary if previous governments failed in the last ten years.
If we don't want to really make government politicians become officials, then we need to be patient and be patient with this very strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only issue as much as it can earn on taxes and fees, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only those will allow a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the UK, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight the crisis on the financial markets together.
There are more than $100 billion in currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks demand the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send to the auction of $40 billion, then another $40 available to the European and Swiss Central Bank.
This is the first time the Central Banks of each State have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is to address the biggest problems in the economy, i.e. the growing deficit of free capital that banks could borrow," Bernard Baumohl wrote in his report to customers from Economic Outlook Group.
“Central banks’ coordinated actions have reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent,” Baumohl added.
Banks have already reached $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what else can follow when they decide to do this,” ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies said.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks are worried that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will be more likely to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy to a recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks decided that after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London Interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about mutual lending of money, although the central banks of the U.S., Canada and Britain dropped their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another downfall of interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts don’t think the central banks’ step will contribute to the crisis because they don’t solve the fundamental problem, and that’s a fall in the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are incredible
Global climate change is most harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed himself in the issue of global warming.
The criticism is now held at the end of the UN International Conference on Changes in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not green planet, he stated that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to the Clause, the unacceptable structure of the conference is not only a strange mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also a significant difference between the rhetoric and reality.
“The debate there is completely unstructured, it’s just a fireworks of words that are a replacement for solving current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president emphasized the fact that his subject is very important for him in the presentation of his book, so he is committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction in the fact that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, “I often only meet with the caricatures of my opinions.”
Now, interested parties can read their unparalleled positions.
Klaus recalls that he is not a climateologist, but he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and evaluate professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main conclusions of the book, the thesis pointed out that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal that there is no consistent view of all scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not represent a threat and that the efforts to affect climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as a person with experiences with totality, he considers it to be unacceptable to invade unpromoted opinions to others, which feels a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained that it is not against “smart environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.”
The same theme was discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn’t replace 600 thousand people.
Six hundred thousand drivers have passed the deadline and have not been able to exchange the old driver's license, whose validity will expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange for a new certificate by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be released on the road after the New Year without valid permission.
According to the authorities, the certificate has not been exchanged mainly by those who don’t even want to run.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of the driver, the authorities in the metropolis are injured by requests and the interest in the exchange of the certificate has increased this week.
The Master delivers approximately 2,000 customers a day.
In fronts, about half an hour is waiting.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not changed their drivers.
The issue of a new certificate takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
The drivers who are obliged to exchange their passports by the end of the year and who are going on the road without a valid driver will be threatened by a penalty from January.
The resident will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
Police can also deal with the offence.
In case of an administrative offence, the penalty is extended to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, he could have received a penalty from the mayor and a person who does not go anywhere.
He could also pay 30,000 crowns.
The ministry previously called on the authorities to be mild and to impose a maximum of a thousand crore penalty.
According to the Minister of Transport, Karl Hanzelka, but tens of thousands of fines are not threatening anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document for which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not a civil certificate that every person must have valid.
People who no longer want to drive should give up the driver's license.
It is sufficient to take it or send it by recommendation by mail to the competent municipal authority.
By the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 ceased to be paid.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have another three years of time to exchange.
The validity of certificates issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court has reduced punishment to detectives associated with Berdych
The former police officers Joseph Opava and Peter Koňarik, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdych, will go to jail for thirteen and ten years.
With the final validity of this, the Supreme Court of Prague decided to reduce their penalties, one year by year and the other by two years.
At first he threatened detectives of the Prague Committee for the Fighting of Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
No longer can be appealed against today’s decision, only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also complained about in this case, but is only waiting for the first-instance dictatorship.
In other cases, however, he has already received fines over 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the National Court recognized particularly from participating in the kidnappings of 19 people, the Supreme Court today addressed the appeal of 16 of them.
Most accused from the initiation of the investigation have rejected the fact that it is a construction case.
According to the Central Senate, police officials, after agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered individual robberies and helped members of the gang avoid criminal liability.
The Gang gave 30 percent of it from the wolf for Opavu and Koňarika.
The prosecution was a criminal activity of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular about thefts, whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of the powers of a public agent and unauthorized arms.
At home checks, the police discovered illegally held guns, shooting with a steel core, a laser targeter or a self-driving.
Gang has been accused of robbery for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to fewer than twenty men in this process, the courts have already authorized to be guilty of other thefts of Berdych and many other people.
Other men around Berdych are still talking to the court in a different trial, some cases have not yet passed before the court.
The main disputes have so far been avoided by Tomashi Potovi and Maroši Šulejovi, who are in the Irish prison, where they are waiting for a definitive decision on their release to the Czech Republic.
Children's Replacement Account: 12 million
For the replacement of children in the family, Igor Veleba’s lawyer wants to compensate for 12 million crowns, plus court exclusions.
For each of the mothers after three million, for fathers after two million, and for children after one million.
Hospitals offer up to 200,000 for each parent.
Ondřej Dostál, the hospital’s legal representative, therefore, disagrees with Veleby’s proposal.
"We reject such a demand, that is very high," he said after today's negotiations.
“But in order to make an opinion on the anti-project, we need a expert assessment that the counterparty has left to draw up.
Let’s see if it has a pronounced value at all.
But we continue to believe that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all," Dotál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jablon wanted for every month when she did not raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
He served as the basis for the negotiation of a compensation expert assessment developed for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motola.
Parents of children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, have suffered mental harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced the burdens that the newborns weren’t prevented.
Women are getting worse again with the actuality of the trauma and what is happening right now, a summary of the contents of Veleba.
Veronika and Nikol exchanged nurses at Terbić's family on December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikolao to Čermák in Przybyslavic and Veronika to Liboru Broz and Jaroslava Trojans in Jabloňov.
Hejtman High Miloš Utstreški transferred in late October each of the families of 100,000 crowns to repay expenses caused to them by the fault of the Trebitic Hospital that the country is creating.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In the event of doubt, they must be entered into the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request the founder's assistance.
The courts have admitted to people relatively low compensation, the sums were calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions of crowns.
Polyvka came to the Kingdom of Valas
Polívka lost controversy about the Valash Kingdom brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava district court, he first used the label of the Value king, but the project built a long-time work of the team around Thomas Harabish, who worked with the actor.
The party did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, the case will probably not end, and the client will appeal.
“The sport is that Mr. Harabiš and his team parasite the popularity of Bolka Polívice,” Polívkov’s lawyer said.
According to him, in the words of the Kingdom of Valas, everyone will be equipped with actors and comics.
He has the same opinion on the Harabish.
“There’s almost a decade of work behind us.
"Shanking money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
“For years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something from it.
They want to parasite our work,” he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the Value king used Polívka for the first time in his television series.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that wasn’t about the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came with the idea of issuers of Vales passports.
From the original recessionist event, trade and lucrative entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabiš later linked the establishment of the Kingdom of Valash.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to specify his name and signature in passports and even offered their discount holders when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabish had only used the hollow idea Polívka published in the manuscript for his business intention.
"The popularity of Boleslav Políva project of the Kingdom of Valas has certainly helped," she said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team that was intensely devoted to him.
The cooperation of the denounced parties continued today until 2000, when Harabiš for Polívka organized official coronation in Vsetína.
Since then, however, there has begun to assemble disputes between Polyvka and Harabish, which raised the sessions of "the king of Boleslav I chosen for the furt".
The leading role in the kingdom was then played by the singer Jarmila Shulakov as the mother of the queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabishe and his company, which the court has rejected today.
Of course, it could bring the Harabish to the dispute a plea for the thrones and half of the princess.
There should be a new king out of it.
He didn’t want to disclose details and dates yet.
"We don't want anything to succeed.
It should be like a king's ride in Slovakia.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also sign up quietly," said Harabish.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Losing Prejudice
In fact, I've never had a lot of Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were nothing strong, the quality of ranking, driving and also production should be marked as under-average.
But now the Peugeot 207 is on the market, and it is much better.
And the SW truck's going a bit further and I'm not left than I think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space on the back seats.
This is already the end of the complaint, because the cars series means that there will be no two-meter lengths in this direction.
The World Summer
I'm going through the interior very quickly so that I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a totally guided design, where I have the only exit to the poor middle tunnel.
I would like to appreciate a little more designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or washings.
The sideway has also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As for the space, there is also a sense of rise in the dimensions of the corrosion.
In the car there is already a shortage of space above the head.
Bags to Bags
The main thing on this car is his luggage.
I have to assess it as very well accessible (and it is also thanks to the rear window) and as appropriately coherent.
Vacuum spaces are equipped with retention tyres that are an ideal compromise.
It does not prevent, it can spread, while maintaining even harder objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
According to tables, it is in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is rather the average value against competition.
However, not against the most sold car of this class in Czech Republic - Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of Teenager products, we will find that Peugeot stops with a lot of remarkable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a car, this value is critical.
But if I had to raise the positive, then I still have to mention the entire straight floor after compilation of the second series or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a four-sized bulb of 1.6 l with a power of 88 kW.
And to say the truth, this should look like a 16-year-old who's driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, it has little consumption and, above all, it leaves.
If I compare it to the harmful period that always acts as if it had been pushed into the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
The price will tell
The price of the car is not human.
However, we need to remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a 14-year-old car for £329 900 will still fall.
Our agregate costs $410,900, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then bring the equipment for an additional £80,000 design.
However, we still had heads of airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic boots, electrical control of rear windows...
The car costs all over 531 900 CZK.
It’s a lot, but you’ll get a lot of additional equipment at Fabia and you’ll get a lot of similar number.
So it’s only left to decide for the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools will not happen
In British schools, children from the countries of Eastern Europe are joined, causing local residents to worry about further developments in local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has hit a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous people are growing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools well illustrates the case in North Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants begin to be resolved.
Speaking, shaking, and shaking between the students also moved to parents’ relationships.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who had a ten-year-old student.
Provincial prevents the boy from insulting her with racist orders.
Police had to intervene after the attack of two ten-year-old girls on a Slovenian immigrant.
The men's girls are supposed to honor racist notes and throw stones on him.
“When we went home, a boy jumped to the bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to leave it, he fired on us with apples and bowls, and then uncovered his back," the mother of the Slovak students described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere of British schools between locals and immigrants begins to be stressed.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been registered for work.
Around 30,000 Slovenian students then visit British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, you can do it if you choose correctly.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm like a fisherman.
Palms and all inclusive with pizzeria, ice cream and cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find it in a complete and even more rich count.
Only on one island but you will find much more and that is the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antills.
Among the Spanish, Cuba was a bastion of their occupation of America.
Columbus called her the most beautiful place ever seen by the human eye.
Havana has become a storage and translation of the treasures that the Spanish in America have captured and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 20s.
He let him build one of the chiefs of the U.S. mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything in the United States was a crime (especially for prohibition) was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, height houses grew, riding cars, which belonged to the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought residence in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had his own yacht in Coimar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures of the showbusines stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autogram on the walls of the Havana Bodeguite.
In the delicious hotel bar Nacional you will have a cocktail as you wish.
And this cult car from the 1950s is still driving through Havana, because once imported shields and fiats in that salt and wet air have long been shaken.
Being Havana, particularly its oldest part, is significantly dissatisfied, yet there are nowhere nearby as many beautiful colonial monuments as there.
Other places also turn into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much money, its development has green.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on the islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and more.
Cuba offers another library that is unique in the world and appreciates it especially by fibers.
A third of the extensive plantations weighed into sugars after narrow steam wheels and motor fibers.
Their car park hasn’t been renovated for many decades, so there are machines that work, whose layers are still in museums elsewhere.
Where to go?
These are the most famous places most visitors to Cuba nemine.
And so about Varadero, or about Havana, you don't have to register too much.
Perhaps just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingwa's settlement is a museum and whoever likes this writer should not miss his visit.
Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque edges of Cuba is Viňales Valley on the west of the island.
The vegetation grows from a calcium floor.
Mogots, calcium homoles and rocks rise hard from the bottom of the valley, and in their dutins a fertile soil has been captured, which causes the airy rocks to be covered with dense growth.
The valley is a place where it grows possibly the highest quality Cuban tobacco.
With its final shape, you can meet if you visit any of the Havana factories for smoking.
Perhaps somebody will be interesting to see that there was Major Zeman's Chilean part.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
He brought him the glory and the wealth of slaves and sugar.
The wealth has turned into the beauty and exhibit of an unexpected city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the hill of Escambray, is so far away that in the 1950s there was no road that would connect that country to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay on the side.
Nothing happened there, and therefore nothing happened, everyone was pleased to have a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon on Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the surrounding area like Playa Ancón Beach, or Sugar Valleys.
In the evening, you can go to Casa de la Música, which enjoys after the sealing, and music quiet in it over the morning.
Baracoa
The city in the east of Cuba is some of the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion affects the road itself.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo must overcome the high and divided mountains and pass through the nature that human activity has almost not mentioned.
The eastern island of Cuba has been enrolled by UNESCO on the list of world heritage thanks to its unbroken nature.
They do the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact, it was formed approximately a hundred years after the Columbus swim) and from a hill where the former castle is standing and today's El Castillo hotel, is seen several table mountains, of which the most famous is El Yunque.
About coffee, ROM, smokers, Sierra Maestra, the Gulf of Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, the sanctuary of the Cuban patronage Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, African religions that confess the descendants of former slaves, a lot could be described on this page.
Unless, as it is correctly said, it is better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
A few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan according to the United States.
NATO, according to Defence Minister Robert Gatese, should plan a specific plan for the next summer.
The mission in Afghanistan does not attempt, according to the assumptions, in Scotland Edinburgh, the representatives of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country have agreed.
In addition to the rising resistance of the Taliban movement, eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and ally coordination.
While the United States this week, through Defence Minister Robert Gatese, called for NATO units to be more active, the UK sees priority in strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and strengthening development aid.
“Evolution in Afghanistan is fatiguable, but military forces can only be a part of the solution.
The next is to allow people to start their own further development of the economy and security," British Defence Minister Des Browne said.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels has been the highest in the last five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of violent acts rose by 27 per cent compared to last year, even 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
They are particularly demanding further helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy about what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s little,” Reuters De Hoop said at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved in the last few months there are disputes on whether all allies are taking the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for passivity.
"Germans have a fairly numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are imposed in areas where minimum violence and fighting rights are not as high as we are in the south and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British bulb newspaper Sun marks German soldiers as lennochs this week.
"Afghanistan fans are revealed: the Germans are playing while our lords are fighting," Sun wrote in a material supplementing pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild moved to the anti-attack and printed British unit photographs at a ragby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to billions in 2009
For each Czech government debt is more than 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion krone by the end of September.
The government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion krone by the end of September.
In nine months of this year, it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its State Debt data from early October.
Each Czech accounts for more than 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion dollars.
"To date, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could exceed the border of billions of crowns until 2009.
The debt should be between 900 billion and a billion korona next year,” said iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek.
The next financial analyst Vladimír Pikora said: “To exceed one billion, we could get through 2009.
When exactly it will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If it seemed that the situation would change on the political scene, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Growth of debt
State debt consists of central government debt and is mainly accumulating deficits of the state budget.
State debt is financed by cash charges, government debt bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has increased by 38,5 billion this year to 719.4 billion kroons.
The state’s foreign debt has risen by 1.7 billion krone to 123.3 billion krone this year.
The so-called tradeable state debt at the end of September reached $803.3 billion and dropped $13.7 billion since June.
The average debt expiry increased to 6.5 years.
“The entire debt annually for the first to third quarter has increased by 13 percent, which is actually a lot about how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the growth is generated mainly in debt bonds where the growth is 20%.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it’s indicating what it’s going to deal with when there’s a retirement reform here,” said Pikora.
Better than expected
The financing and government debt management strategy for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly a deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion dollars this year instead of the expected 91.3 billion dollars.
It is also a planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroons, a ten billion pension reserve, funding of 43 billion kroons of state debt and payments of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion kroons.
A woman is going to come to court in Chartum for giving her name to a plywood bear.
The British teacher, sentenced in Sudan for insult to Islam, was sentenced to fifteen-month prison by one Chartumi court on Thursday night, and was released, as her lawyer said.
The British was accused of leaving six to seven-year-old pupils to give the name of Mohamed to a plywood bear despite the prohibition of any display of the prophet to Islam.
She was punished by a rash wounded.
This British 40-year-old teacher, working at Unity High School in the Sudanese Charter, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of injury to Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after several students have filed a complaint.
Our story begins in fact already in September, when the teacher requires his six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for a class-climbing bear.
"The children's mouth will name eight names, including Hasan, Abduláh, and Mohamed," says Robert Boulos, director of school.
After the vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children finally choose the most popular name of Mohamed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread baptism name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by the description "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself had no labels with this name, but it was difficult to see the prophet as a insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, has stated that she knows it well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I just regret that she asked children to vote for some name," it is, according to him, just a "innocence."
Such a view is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attention to their disciples" and add that "it never speaks of religion in the classroom."
Remember that the baptism name Mohamed is also the second most commonly awarded baptism name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This baptism name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way of worshiping the prophet (often awarded to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this baptism name?
Is it possible to give a toy?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
At the last round of the negotiations on Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Finally, I failed.
Serbian and Kosovon Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, and at the same time the last round of conversations, without being able to overcome different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement," EU negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a Vienna press conference.
His U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "in bet" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to take care of their commitments to peace and were ready to dialogue even after the negotiations were completed.
“We don’t expect violence in the near future, but we enter into the challenging period,” he added, “it is obvious that the situation is stressed.”
The negotiations end on 10 December
The Trinity negotiators, consisting of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last go to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population, could be seen in a clearer light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexandr Bocan-Charchenko have to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The negotiations in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the United Nations entrusted Troy with new negotiations in August this year.
Americans and Europeans say that the talks will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have previously blocked the appointment of independence of Kosovo in the UN Security Council, are, on the contrary, seeking to continue the negotiations even after the deadline set.
“Russia was and remains awarded a negotiated, compromised solution,” Bocan-Charchenko said.
Single-sided Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under EU supervision to be the only good solution.
Pristan declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade continues for extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we haven't reached any agreement," said President Fatmir Sejdi in a hotel in Baden, where this "last chance" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, the former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and the future Prime Minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade " belongs to the past that led to murders and deportation."
"Dominal effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the contrary, believes that the compromise is still taking into account and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "domain effect" in a region that is still unstable as a result of wars for independence in the 1990s.
“But that does not mean for Serbia,” he said, “a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation urged all decisions to belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian allies have veto law.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, it is the only acceptable solution that comes from the Security Council," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
"This negotiation took two years.
It has to end as she began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on status will have the Kosovo parliament" and added that if an unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking people would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush calls for an agreement on Israeli and Palestinians
At the start of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called out from his resignation, U.S. President George Bush announced that Israeli and Palestinians finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate start of the negotiations with the intention of solving a 60-year dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything he could to help them conclude a “pace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said and reminded both sides of the obligation to come out of the "city map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all unresolved issues without exception, including central issues."
This statement includes three issues in the core of the conflict between Israeli and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the territory of the state of Israel in 1948.
Abbas spoke after the U.S. President and emphasized that the subsequent negotiations would be "complete and thorough" and affect all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In the court, Olmert expressed his opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it must be "sealed to be closed during 2008".
Bush appointed the end of 2008 as a term for the implementation of his "visum of two states", the Palestinian and Israeli, existing next to each other.
Saudi Arabia has announced that Bush has accepted a commitment in this sense before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, offering peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories formed during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "cross in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," said Prince Saud in an interview, which gave an Arabic-speaking newspaper a protected Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutors, police have no responsibility.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in such small reports from the black chronology, the official versions do not agree with what people are talking about.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the Inspection General de la Police National (IGPN), the police car crossed the Louise-Michel street shortly after 17 p.m. in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in intervention, but was on the guard and passed at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, while no side lights were turned on," the police source said.
The green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unregistered, and therefore without public communications permission" (see below), managed by two youths without landing, passed "very high speed".
"The motorcycle dropped from the left to the police car after he didn't prefer right," a police officer said.
The test of alcohol promile in the blood carried out on the vehicle crew has proven negative.
The state of the car (protruded front, dismantled front glass, locked touchers) indicates the severity of the strike.
Marie-Thérèse de Givry, prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise), responded very quickly and announced that the IGP had been entrusted to investigate the "deeds of unintentional murder and not providing assistance to police departments in the threat."
At the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor noted that the investigation led by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police for the accident.
Three witnesses who were interviewed on Sunday evening confirmed "the police version, that the mini-motor approached them relatively quickly."
Some kind of rice, undoubtedly caused by clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained climbed until the time the police car was able to shine.
Vehicles have been secured and will go through technical expertise.
On both the bodies of the victims, a drink was carried out yesterday.
What happened, right then?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people were rapidly speaking that police should quickly leave the place of the crime without providing the first aid to two young people.
The IGPN should, with all caution, also exclude "any serious crime" in this section.
"It is a more challenging aspect of investigation that requires more research and with which you need to be very careful," the police source said.
The newspaper "Libération" met with the obvious witness of those moments following the accident.
One of his windows leads right where the accident took place.
"We and a nurse who is a nurse in the hospital immediately went down to try to resurrect them," the witness said.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw a "boiled, completely frightened policeman."
Two others tried to raise one of the young men and the fourth spoke to the phone.”
Faced with rapidly growing tensions and certainty of the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were driven by the cars of colleagues who arrived in the place.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
They also spent heart massage, but lost.
"Let no one say that police authorities haven't come to help young people.
These young people were given first aid.
The hasicians arrived immediately.
Everything has been done for their rescue," the prosecutor said.
Voltages in Pakistan rise
The Pakistani police oppressed the first demonstration on Monday since the announcement of the extraordinary state by General Musharaf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken in the exceptional state were injured by tear gas granates, which, according to witnesses, used ordinary forces.
The last names responded with stone, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were appealed.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them had to be appealed.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court’s attorneys called for a general trial and announced demonstrations, as a result of the waves, about five hundred arrests of opponents, fighters for human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
The streets of access to the Supreme Court were suspended on Monday morning in order to prevent meetings.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northern west).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement received support from the politically strong alliance, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president “warned the population to send flowers to judges who stood against the exceptional state and waste to those who made a oath before Musharaf.”
"Musharaf's promises don't come true"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is a direct burden to the emergency action declared on Saturday evening.
In the next few days, the legal reelection of President Musharaf in the indirect presidential election held on October 6.
Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry’s president was removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness are illegal, anti-constitutional, and anti-constitutional judgments of the Supreme Court," the official said in the newspaper The News.
The promise of Parvis Mušarafa to give up the army’s leadership and become a civilian president “not payable” after the introduction of an exceptional state, said deputy minister of information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to give up military uniforms until November 15, when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Deputy Minister also confirmed that January elections could be delayed.
Otherwise, the Pakistani government also forced speculation in the country, according to which the representative of the army had to order President Musharaf's home jail.
More than a third of pregnancy still constitutes unexpected pregnancy
This project includes unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as poorly planned or in an unexpected manner.
More than one in three (36%) pregnancy is still unexpected today, the French Institut national d'études demographics (Ined) - State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which concluded contraception in France.
This project includes unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as poorly planned or in an unexpected manner.
Various contraception methods such as hormonal contraception or sterilization still show 5% to 6% of failure, Ined estimates.
The contraception of contraception, however, only enabled better "fertility control", says the institution and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age was 60% from 5% in 1970 today.
Finally, eight births in ten are well planned today.
One pair of five is even calculated for a month precisely and, if possible, in spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of a baby.
Repair of the space station
Over seven hours of work in the universe, astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) needed to remarkably repair the dispersed solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky entry into the universe that collected records about the length of duration, distances from residential modules, the speed at which it was planned and the "astronauts" measured to repair.
Difficulties appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship released the Harmony module, a large war department designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see frame).
This module is some kind of adhesive mole for the laboratory modules.
You need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to move a 17-hour module producing electricity using the solar panels already located in the ISS, so that it would be in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to deploy seventy-six meter solar panels of the module.
And in that one of the panels, spreading as a sharp harmonic, as a result of the crashing of the cable, was damaged to the surface at least one meter.
The disclosure was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who initially had to carry out a check-out on the Discovery ship, and then went to repair another solar panel, whose rotation system had a disturbance, were forced to devote to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the arm of the station, and made a repair.
It is one of the best “spacewalkers” of the US Office for Aviation and Space (NASA).
High, steady, very reverse, has very developed breast and long legs.
At the age of 46, this original call was given by the doctor to "operate" a "devastated" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he removed the defect cable and fixed it to the damaged places some sort of "plate".
He helped him by the second spacewalker who stayed near the balance chamber, as well as from inside, other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, commander of the crew.
The tools he used, namely, a mini-hockey weared insulation to prevent electric shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and produced by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully distributed and then zincred his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday as planned.
EADS is weakened
EADS will lose its shares on the Paris Stock Exchange after the airline and defence industry announced it would have to spend €1.2 to €1.4 billion to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
The EADS has lost 4% and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange for €21.96.
The financial group was forced to review its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the delays arising from the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is the condition of the launch flight.
The price for delays in military cargo aircraft supplies, announced in October, was calculated "to 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus", said the EADS' mother company.
Due to these costs, the EADS will be forced to announce a new outlook of profits prior to the deduction of interest and taxes (EBIT) in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday.
The group also announced that a new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Let’s remember that EADS’ production results fell by 86% in 2006, particularly due to the costs associated with the delays of another programme, namely the massive A380 aircraft.
The group initially assumed the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French Army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday elections will take place without a stressful expectation: Russians will mostly elect President Putin's party, United Russia.
So confirming, after the end of the very few free election campaigns, their attraction to stability, and their authority.
Today, three days before the elections to the House of Parliament, Russian President Vladimir Putin will send voters to the public-law stations a predetermined television message, but the content of which is kept secret.
This is the position of the leader of the United Russia, the Prokremel party, which, according to all, celebrates the victorious victory.
When he welcomed ambassadors of foreign countries yesterday, the president left nothing out of him and satisfied with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we wish the most transparent and open choices, without any minor defects in beauty,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it is not so far away.
They condemn the campaign noted by various pressures.
The leader of the Communists, Gennadij Zhuganov, says that "there have never been such a dirty election, neither for Jelcina."
After the last weekend's demonstrations, former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, continues to be banned from visits.
"Russians remain mentality homo Soviet"
In the background of these straightforward expectations of parliamentary elections, there are two much more open questions:
“Who will become Putin’s successor in the presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of presidential elections, 2 March 2008; candidates may be presented to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-electioned in 2004, cannot seek the third mandate in the row.
However, no follower is manifested.
“What role will Putin play after March?”
Will I be a prime minister?
Or the boss of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful party of the United Russia, who chooses government and president?
Whether this is the case, the departing government will win all the lines in parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Russians have remained the mentality of homo Soviets, they do not feel the master of their fate," says Lev Gudkov, the director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolaj Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, observed time-wide connections: the civil society, in this country, a five-century Christianity in Europe, was delayed; that famous common spirit delayed the creation of individualism.
After liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin linked to a paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population rather than that this new paternalism caused terrorism, but some economic prosperity," Maria Lipman, a Carnegie Foundation, believes.
The Russians today "refute their personal responsibility" which they soon demonstrated after the disruption of the Soviet Union.
"What do you think?"
This phenomenon applies to all social layers, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain status quo: 65 governors (of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) are governed by local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the nineties, a synonym of chaos.
The public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamary Čerednichenko, fourteen-year-old professor: "What do you think?
Those who are in power aren’t so bad, so why change them?”
The burdened memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which resemble the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, open up to the public.
47 million archive documents stored at a length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were available to this time only for a "humanistic" purpose, i.e. individually and namely, on request of the former victims or its authorized persons.
In May, 11 countries, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this Agreement has ended by all States, the opening of yesterday has become effective.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow "especially the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health condition of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité International de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, have been opposed to the public's access to these nominated documents because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
Registers of concentration camps or lockers created by the Gestaps were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced work undertaken by civilians, bringing them evidence of their internationality to open the way of their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen have tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"Nothing can be expected from these documents essentially new," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism in Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
The bilateral trade between Europe and India now reaches less than €60 billion a year.
The EU is the first trade partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade treaty in 2008, Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said.
In April last year, the EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission a Green to start negotiations to sign a Free Trade Agreement (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India now reaches 60 billion.
The EU is the first trade partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the ninth EU trade partner.
"The free trade agreement greatly surpasses both economies," and "India gets a better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products of the exported Indias, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European gigant, José, exchanged together "47 billion euros in goods" and "twenty billion euros in services" and "twenty billion euros in services" by the President of India, the President of the European Commissioner, the President of the European Commission, the President of the European Union, the President of the European Commission.

The British Bank took awareness of concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
The British Bank announced on Thursday that it intends to relieve current concerns about the deterioration of credit market conditions again and announced a £10 billion in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75 %, which is unusually valid for a long time.
"In an effort to relieve the concerns that the financial market conditions will be extremely unfavorable at the end of the year and to give banks greater security in the way to ensure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin the communication on the 5th open-week market on 6 December."
The Bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, for a basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time that BOE pumps cash on the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally it takes a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "she remains ready to take additional measures to maintain interest rates" between bank loans at the same level with its basic rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was 6.6%, which is the highest number since September 18th.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the British Bank have been associated with tax rates that banks have dismissed since the use of this offer.
According to some speculations enhanced by the development of the Euro pound rate, many preferred to decide for the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un popular movement, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with the proposals of Socialists (PS) on acquisition
UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused on Thursday to discuss the individual paragraphs of the Socialist Proposal for Acquisition Act, which is equal to the rejection of text.
On the agenda, the text of the bill was received within the framework of the so-called socialist "new" (the meeting initiated by the individual Member Club) and included ten measures taken on Tuesday by the PS presidency, including an increase in employment premium by 50 %, the renewal of curling TIPPs, transport checks or regulations.
Since UMP and NC voted against the negotiations of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the session was ended after a general debate, which became an opportunity to exchange opinions, sometimes more live, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television presentation on acquisition.
Jean-Marc Ayrault, Chairman of the PS Members, has announced that his club will re-present these proposals in its fullness as supplements to the amendment to the financial bill, which the Parliament will discuss next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents founded a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the British Republic Festival Melvina Benna.
“For our company, it is the honor to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones, a C3 server on Billboard.com.
C3 is produced by Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer campsite.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Director of the Republic Festival, formerly known under the name Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festival organizers.
In 1989, the Reading Festival was awarded in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006, the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
As a co-owner, Melvin Benn is also responsible for production, license and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which has a capacity of up to 177,500 people today.
Charlie Jones from C3 designates Glastonbury as “the most inspiring event ever experienced and says his company and Melvina Benna are working simultaneously to give the region a festival event in European style.
"We initially chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to set up a festival in the center of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
“I was with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited for the project.
Unfortunately, because of the city’s current leadership, we have been in politics, Charlie Jones adds.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are ready to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the inhabitants of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents raised the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago Grant Park in 2005, after the Austin City Limits Music Festival was organized in 2002.
The gross markets for both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8m and $11.3m.
Both of these festivals are held in the urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benn’s festival takes place in rural areas, while our festivals are taking place in green areas in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
“Our goal is to congratulate both of these concepts in a certain way to create an impression of the rural festival across Europe and the city across America.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland City, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the event,” says Charlie Jones.
The last nominated refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, saying, "they are beneficial enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of the festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which captures 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can be confirmed at the time the program is only printed.
“Vineland will have a rocky breath, but music will be there, so that we can attract a wide range of audiences if possible,” Carlie Jones says.
C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award in the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to get Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator itself stands against it.
This conviction mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to fall into the "government"?
“We need to be careful, it’s the industry who decides where to go.
If you find the conditions in Montreal are favorable, then it will go there.
“Our task is to offer those that they will be considered the best,” he said.
Honba for festivals
For this moment, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is to promote the local film.
They have already started hunting for the Oscars.
On all festivals on the West Coast, whether it’s festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about presenting Quebec films, warning them and ensuring that the directors provide conversations.
The age of darkness had a good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be held at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil will be presented in Santa Monice and will be presented in November on the 30th anniversary of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Québec also presented four short-speed and four full-night films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will it come at the end of the year on the market for marathon? Experts split the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks are left by the end of the year, and investors are already in my hands expecting that the traditional marathon will happen at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts aren’t so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes "in a statistical sense, the month of December has a positive course on the market".
However, predictions cannot be created exclusively on the basis of statistics, particularly because, at least in the short term, there are certain doubts in the current relationships of the market.”
These experts do not assume that the burden has spread over the last few weeks of the year, and say that "the foreign market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, particularly fixed income impacted by the effect of the turnover on quality securities, both in the daytime".
Therefore, they believe that the bursa will have a quiet course rather than without volatility, "especially because it is not known about the impact of the likely loss of Fed (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflation pressure incentives."
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BPI banks in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time for a brave statement that the marathon will take place.
“There’s no reason to be happy,” the expert said.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year by a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to rebuild portfolios and traditional pension deposits that occur every year during this period.
However, this expert indicates that this year everything will be a bit different, as it is believed that the marathon will occur earlier, in the second December week after a prolonged weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
This analyst does not believe that volatility would affect market direction.
Federico Olucha, analyst Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and "for this reason we could observe the reflection of the index triggered by US reports on the impact of the credit market crisis."
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree with the selection of titles that make sure Ibex gets out to the new maximum quotas.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "This year is a series of strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "as this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco, on the other hand, ensures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Building companies will also be able to enrich on this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been resuming its position for several months, and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go on the same path," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be in advance in the last part of the year thanks to increased sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also be very good, although they are not too representative in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only a month of collapse in two cases.
The real marathon took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the administrative year, when the bursa markets ended the crisis caused by the crash of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 gained 28.17% back, it was a 6.68% increase in December.
We will still see whether 2007 will be the fifth profit year (until Ibex has increased by 8.36%) in January and whether it will be able to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred bank branches of Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Bank of Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, it is the first group to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening period of their branches up to 20:30 pm and open on Saturday from 10:00 to 20:30 pm.
BBVA, another group, who has also repeatedly assured that he wants to extend the opening period of his branches, has not yet decided to take this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the committees on the cancellation of the opening hours 75 per cent of its branches on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of the Popular Bank will be decisive for other entities to join this initiative, which supports the opening period of trade or not.
This is exactly the goal of the project that the Bank of Popular has made.
Get individual customers to these places for their shopping, small and medium-sized enterprises, livestock and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 branches across Spain within about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but only about adjusting existing branches.
Therefore, the bank modernizes branches that already have in business areas by adapting them to the customer profile in each street.
The extension of the opening time is complemented by different concepts of the branch space and the new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
The business director of the bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not be a major investment, but a greater staff income as it moves from six employees to eight to nine branches.
The branches will even be equipped with spaces for SMEs meetings and will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Bank of Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as explained by Angel River.
The branches were chosen in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seems to have been a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 more specialized immigrants, operated under the brand Mundocredit, also have a very long opening period and is open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivera said.
They just agreed with Telephone to sell mobiles via external staff.
Telecinco first doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3
We've done it.
This phrase was expressed by Paolo Vasile, Executive President Telecinco, in the conclusion of the trade, when he found that the television he conducted doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing has led to his joy: ‘I’m sorry, that’s not so much because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve fallen less.’”
However, he stressed that because of the weak market, we have fallen less.
Telecinco stopped trading with 2.54%.
This profit drew their loss from the last part of the year to 15.66%.
The burden value of this company controlled by Mediasete (with 52% of capital) with Vocent's participation (outside 13%) is EUR 4 488.88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
Her competitor Antenna 3, which declined by 1.52% yesterday and declined by 40.5% since January, has a half-value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies estimated is 3.571 billion in the Sogecable case, 2 518,53 million Prisa (editor Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is offered, because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we will evaluate it in tracking."
Telecinco announced last week that it counts this year on the fact that overcoming billions of gross revenue from the advertisement will be the first television channel, as said Giuseppe Tringali, Executive President Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch ensuring the group’s advertising.
If the predicted data were actually achieved, this TV channel would see an increase in revenue from the advertisement by 3.6% in 2006 compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net rate of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of the TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on is that for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock market is the increased pay out that has remained: in 2006, this company, chairman Alejandro Echevarría, divided 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although decision-making is soon, this coefficient could change after buying 33% of Endemol along with its parent company Mediaset.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
I hope that this year we will be able to satisfy our shareholders with which we have already increased the 33% value of Endemolu."
According to analysts, the market now shows a certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates for Telecinco profits by 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This is due to explaining that the expected income growth has stopped from 0.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.5 % in 2009.
The company decreased the expected profit of Antenna 3, from 4.5 % in 2008 to 7.5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
Articles 1
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles primarily based on increased revenue for dividend and long-term sustainable potential.
Articles 2
Caja Madrid: Rate Telecinco better than Antenna 3 due to its "number preference" and trade growth.
Articles 3
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to evaluate them as they face ‘like threats’ (sacrificed market and deteriorated economic environment).
Congress approved MiFIDu transposition valid from 1 November
In conjunction with parliamentary negotiations, which have been ended by the vote of the Congress on the novels included in the Senate in the bill, the government has undergone a public hearing of a new law, in order to enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties have consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and detailed regulations of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which amends the Securities Trade Act, provides for the modernisation of the financial markets and, at the same time, strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the European Union supervisory authorities.
This new regulation will enable financial advisory services to specialized companies, both physical and legal persons, and create a new type of financial services providers (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which are associated with securities, mediators with securities and port management companies.
In addition, the number of financial instrument operational systems is expanded by connecting multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems that will compete with current exchange brokers.
The law also commits companies providing investment services to spread information on the market about the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risks and methods of risk-harmonization and requires the report of all operations carried out to simplify CNMV supervision.
During the negotiations at the Congress’s Trade Commission, several amendments were included, including those to prevent securitized claims from being considered a “complete” financial instrument due to the high risk for investors, which was proven by what happened in the US with high-risk hypothetical debt (subprimes).
The transposition of the Directive was also used to legalize functions that can occupy graduates in the field of economics and business management 30 years after a royal decree was adopted in 1977, which represents the professional functions reserved for economies.
At the same time, the Senate has ranked the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide products trading services and acquire customers for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by 5/10 to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which will later serve Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy to provide timely and quality data comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (Statistics Institute) reminded that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore it must not necessarily be consistent with the final data that will be published on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to be at a relatively high level"
Second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of the Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the November ISC rise to 4.1% was "a temporary number," while predicted that the price index would continue to be at a relatively high level in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress's balloons stated that "even if it is not a favourable number," the inflation difference between Spain and the currency union is still the same "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprised" than the previous month, when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We expected a value of about 4%," the Minister of Economy said today.
Virgin plans to make 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Since mid-September, Northern Rock has become a crisis and had to retreat to the emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
The bank then managed record deposits of more than £25 billion, which gradually declined within two and a half months in the client’s lack of trust, although the government offered a 100% guarantee for these money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity’s name with its Virgin Money financial brand, needs to obtain about a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks over the next three years, so as to gain the remaining 18 billion pounds to reach 30 billion targets.
Richard Branson’s Magnet Group, known in the United Kingdom for its creative advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its commitment.
The Northern Rock Bank marks this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, which consists of three other companies, such as that they prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Totana's oldest detained for alleged corruption practices in construction
In early morning, the civil guard detained the current mayor of the city of Totan (from the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in corruption practices in construction, which were revealed this week.
One of the secretaries and local police officers was arrested.
In May of this year, José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current human deputy, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to survey sources of Cadena SER TV, could have been the 'head' of the entire company.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the municipality and the construction committee and do not exclude further arrests in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect of corruption practices in construction, was accused of being revealed at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, the 'human' lawyer, Juan Morales, who was verified, was arrested when he left Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to research sources, Morales' alleged selection of commissions for his signature of a construction agreement with the Galician construction firm, which has been overqualified for 200 hectares of land.
There are currently eight people arrested.
Bono accepted the offer of the state to be headed by the PSOE candidate in Toledo and, if they win, presidency of Congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the proposal by the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Socialist José Luise Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general elections in head of the PSOE Charter (Spain's Workers Socialist Party) in Toledo and in the case of the general Congressmen to win all
So it was announced at the press conference by the PSOE secretary for the organization José Blanco and Bono, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place in the party's federal headquarters in the afternoon.
The executive chief justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "it is among the best".
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this La Manchy politician will be a candidate for the Democratic Party president of Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono, as Congress president, would replace Manuel Marín, who on 15 November published his decision not to nominate in the next general elections and leave his active political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly urged him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He added that as the citizens know who will be Deputy Minister of Economy if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce "transparent form" who would be president of Congress.
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that the House will be transformed into "home of respect and not pleasurers or crying" and achieves that "it will become more and more like citizens."
“Sometimes, unfortunately, it appears that the only place in Madrid that cannot be spoken in peace and quiet is Congress, the Senate’s president, at one opportunity, stopped 26 times.”
In the same way, he spoke praise to current President Manuel Marín and his “good work” and did not want to imagine himself in his place so that he would not lower himself to what his opponents might be considered a “biggest.”
Climate propaganda
Because the movement against climate change undermines unpleasant persecution both those who look skeptical at his predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles, they must demonstrate solid coherence.
In addition, he has a movement leader who is the president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new agreement with the planet".
This proposal makes him explain why the activities or inactivity of his government have significantly contributed to the failure of Spain to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Whoever is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening, and why his government, the government of the covenant, did not prevent it.
In addition, it is forced him to explain to the Spanish as clear as possible what measures he intends to take to speed up climate change.
What companies will damage, what habits of the population will have to change, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to adopt and what economic consequences will have.
In other words, who is sacrificing himself and who is paying for the rescue of the planet.
But we did not wait for such explanations, nor did we wait for them.
Just because it is necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Actions against climate change, true measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one centimeter of the price of petrol, proposed by the PSOE (Spain Workers Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of the elections that he prompted to reject it.
In other words, it is to save the planet in order that nothing will remain, a pure propaganda, the passwords that lose any real significance.
Personal phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the agreements with the planet; this master is so useful for the election campaigns that he does not even speak, he does not accuse, he does not require anything, but he is the decoration of the possessions and he stimulates them.
If it is restricted to be just a virtual contracting party and does not want us to ride bicycles and cool with a bike.
Totana's local police boss is arrested for suspicion of corruption practices in construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the Mayor of Totan, the "leaf" of José Martínese Andreo, head of local police, the secretary of the municipality and one entrepreneur in hospitality, for suspicion of crimes committed in construction.
Starosta was arrested in his residence and transferred to a municipality, in which he is now located with a number of police officers who also entered the Construction Commission and the City Company for Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests arrived at six in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, in the operation associated with a requalifier of approximately 2 million hectares of agricultural soil on the ground suitable for the construction to allow the Galician company Nuaria to be there after paying illegal commissions for 4,000 after the last election period.
Additionally, two other people were not arrested, but were accused of abbreviated proceedings in Totan's first instance court.
The first six arrested were sent to the court today.
According to information sources, former mayor Totany is investigated and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
He was also accused of his former wife, the owner of a real estate office, registered today in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, lawyer and entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (province Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, who belongs to the group and whose charges were transferred.
The investigation is conducted by the Criminal Group in the construction of the Operational Central Unit of Civil Guard, whose members, besides the arrest, also conducted eleven investigations, mostly in companies related to arrests, with headquarters in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedře, Las Rozas (province of Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a very well-known company owner of poultry meat products that could serve as a intermediary.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the position of the largest residential complex in the Moroccan city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, golf courses and two spa hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of soil in Totana, which was overqualified and its project had to double the settlement of a municipality with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to promoting the real estate market, Conycase, which operates parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela, and on the Fernando el Católico square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and preconiza, which is focused on sales and promotion.
And that's happening.

Our Finnish writer sends us this comment from yesterday’s most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (in the beginning of the world’s educational level PISA report), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18, on the same day that Black’s criticism came up with circumstances.
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public discussions about the tragedy of school in Jokela.
The murderer of the victim, a high school student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the Education Council responsible for the subject of philosophy, requested on the website of Helsingin Sanomat to make a critical opinion on Plato and claimed that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory primary course of philosophy at high school.
Articles 3
One colleague informs the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the criminal law:
A. The download of a song would be a criminal offence with a rate of six months to one year.
On the contrary, if you pull a plate at a price of less than 400 euros in the store, it is considered to be a simple violation (§ 623.1).
B. If you cut up to €1,000 in a trade, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than the download (art. 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than downloading (Section 244.1)
D. It’s less difficult to participate in cravings than in exchange for compacts.
Participation in the court shall have a rate of three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts shall be a rate of six months to two years.
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual disturbance in employment is considered less serious in accordance with § 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is vice-punishable than providing pornographic materials to youth (§ 186).
So if my colleague isn't wrong, somebody's got a hand, and it's okay.

My caregiver will tell me one of his articles on strange research titled "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
It is not the feelings caused by monthly salary in employees that depend on how much their colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance on the tomograph and the results are published in the latest number of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the Vision of Life&Brain neurocognic group in Germany, "the biggest activation occurred when the researcher responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was slight, but when one received a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion requires so much science.

What insurance is suitable for me?
The vehicle insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a significant expense that depends on different factors, such as age, status, gender, duration of the driver's passport, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a truck is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to choose the right car insurance than to choose the car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment takes on itself in the form of an insurance contract that provides that the insurance company will receive an agreed insurance amount in a certain amount to take care of the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
The insurance price is the insurance price that is determined for different factors such as age, status, gender, duration of the driver's license, type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies determine their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely the accident will occur, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women must pay lower insurance because statistics indicate that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, the insurance company concluded that married persons have less accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving, thus likely to have some accident.
Increased frequency of driving increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose an insurance that best matches his insurance profile.
Here we will show the most important variables for choosing the type of insurance which, in addition to satisfying the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People younger than fifty are facing various disadvantages such as little experience in driving and short driving license when they want to deal with insurance at an affordable price.
Although ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are even cheaper options.
The most important drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance in order to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the client's participation in payment of the insurance event.
“A part of the payments of the insurance event provided by the customer will be determined in advance when the price of the insurance will be higher, which will be lower to participate,” explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, the Internet insurance mediator.
Another option is that the insurance is extended to other operators by ensuring that the customer is insured against damage caused by other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, the malus is the increase of the above basic rates.
"The bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to increase the bonus,” explains Noguera.
After twenty-five years of crossing the border, drivers are easier to deal with insurance as the customer’s risk index is reduced thanks to their experience.
For this reason, it is best to negotiate insurance against all risks with discount.
"Young people can usually not take advantage of the experience that has been gained in advance at the time of an accident, and not even at the time of driving," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving when a newborn was already overcome.
However, if a client is married, but still has no children, it is better to deal with insurance against all risks if its economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered to be a client with the lowest risk index and therefore their inflows will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance against all risks would be insurance discount (which could cost 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting the third year after the purchase of a vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their acquisition capacity is higher, so they can allow overs to get the highest discount," Luis Noguera said.
Pensioners are recommended insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance (which amounts to €150) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is so important not only because it protects drivers in an accident, but also because it represents significant expenditure, which is a detrimental reason for the proper examination of insurance options that would be most appropriate to us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get the AC Milan point, which means eight finals
AC Milan and Celtic will make their efforts on Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as it would mean for Italy to be the first and for Scots it would decide to be the location.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the 5th remiss match in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but it needs another one to make sure that six points will not be played before him with Benfi, who has four.
These two matches of Group D will be played a week before the sixth round end, since AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the first time it will take place in the 13th semi-final, in an attempt to put into the 16th final.
So this group will be closed sooner than others and the unresolved result at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium appears to be the most likely, even though both teams will try to win because the Italians will not want to tactic on their home soil and Celtic knows that after the victory, he would be the first and would be better off.
The man Gordon Strachan could be enough to lose even if he won not, but can't rely on it because at the same number nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) but won in the first direct race (2:0).
And so, AC Milan players will try to destroy the evening to Scots who believe that for the second time they will get to the semi-final in the reorganized Champions League just as they won in the same race in the previous race goal Kaká in the prolongation (1:0) after 0:0 in the base game time.
Hopefully the "rossoners" will win Shahtor, for whom he is awarded victory only if Celtic loses, both for the procedure to the eighth finals and for the remaining in the UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and does not have the opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, could achieve a third place with one victory, so it would play in the UEFA.
20,000 people participated in the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
Spice Girls launched its first tour in Vancouver (Canada) 20,000 viewers since its departure in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place in Vancouver.
Around 20,000 people bought tickets to be present in a concert, which also included a video similar to the history of the group, which caused sensation in the late 1990s.
Returns and world tours take place at the same time as the new album released by EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the fence decorated narratives given by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience flooded by GM Place, although Victoria had banned it a few days ago.
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham stated about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show."
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of conflicts between us" caused two years later the release of the five-member group, also revealed his nervousness at a meeting with journalists two hours before the performance began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw the world's public opinion changed, Spice Girls' opinion changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I decided to,” Chisholm said about the reconnection of the group that she released nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "the times have equated and we all love one another."
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls first appeared together in 1998.
Initially, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virgin Airlines.
At the arrival, an army was expected at the airport.
Five have a total of seven children.
After a concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He will be in Madrid on 23 December.
Fears from a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the price of natural gas, thereby increasing the risk of the Russian fuel supply to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is led by pipelines across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is carefully monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises the gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year reduced delivery to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, seek to agree how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says Ukraine will have to pay more because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas that comes from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this might mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its delivery from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said Reuters, Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoli Kinach.
“The changes in gas prices should certainly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) across Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which significantly increased prices.
Russian gas represents one-quarter of supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stock in the world, but most of them remain insufficiently used.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The auditor said the Scottish NHS Chambers had to improve criminal record checks for non-European employees.
Recommendation from the President of the Supreme Supervisory Office Robert Black came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to a June attack on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black also fears that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were underway on the sample of five health authorities.
The Chairman of the Supreme Supervisory Authority was interested in staff from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately after June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Thirty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone hired Jeep to the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court by video mosquito accused of joining attempts on a bombing attack in the UK.
The NHS Chamber is expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experiences and authorisations for work in the UK before its employment.
Although Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to control criminal records, the Agency has no power to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report by the Chairman of the Supreme Supervisory Authority says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to conduct the Criminal Records Bureau Directives, which helps employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the staff's records contained evidence of these inspections, they are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said that Scotland's NHS in many ways agrees with its own policy of pre-employment checks, but also added: "Our report warns the areas in which the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information about the amount of foreign personnel."
Scottish BMA President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employed checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report indicates that current pre-employed checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear to what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities reported that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of which are doctors and nurses.
However, the Chairman of the Supreme Supervisory Authority noted that these numbers would probably be higher as well as because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with permission to stay.
The investigation also found that the initiated control procedures for NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently re-elaborating the policy and directive on pre-employment checks for NHS foreign workers.
The Ministry of Health, Nicola Sturgeon, said, "I wanted to do this job immediately after a terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish government will consider the recommendations of the report in accordance with the health committees and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employment inspection directives of all staff - including foreign personnel - which they plan to issue next month.
Joy Division wins the film awards
Control, a lifetime film about the deceased singer of Joy Division Ianu Curtis, won five awards for the British Independent Film Awards, including the awards for the best film.
The awards were also received by the star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was nominated as the best actress for the thriller of the scandal recordings.
Daniel Craig has won Variety's award for receiving a British film on the world scene.
The prices were celebrated in London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' journey to the famous Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-white film, whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, cost only 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known thanks to the iconic packing of the U2 Joshua Tree album, two prizes - for the best directed and for the best debut director.
Rock music was focused on another award - because the film Juliena Templa on singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentation.
Viggo Mortensen won the best actor’s play as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in London’s thriller David Cronenberg’s East Oath.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard guys, has won Richard Harris' award for the unusual benefit of the British film.
This fifty-year-old, including Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming another part of Indiana Jonese, the Kingdom of the Crystal Leaf.
Winstone said he was proud of the prize named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened doors to people like me," he added.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honorable."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a court where filmmakers, actors and organizers of the festival meet.
Bif’s sponsors and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for a terrorist attack
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing a direct attack on oil equipment and also on spiritual and security components.
The state television of the largest oil exporter said one of the cells wanted to invade missiles into the country.
The al-Qaeda sympathizers have led a campaign against the monarchy, the United States allies, since 2003, i.e. from an invasion in Iraq.
A televised report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned assault on oil facilities in the Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia will set a quick response unit of 35,000 members to defend the equipment from the failed al-Qaeda attack to the world's largest oil processing factory in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report cited the ministry's internal statement: 18 detained belonged to a cell led by a "missile fire expert" who dropped into the country.
She also said that the militants planned to break into the kingdom of eight shots.
22 detained were to prepare for the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the spirit to further attempt to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Army and the Shiite government supported by the United States, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider as Kashirian.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that authorities have collected many spiritual in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants – supported by the challenges of al-Qaeda Saudi leader Usama bin Ladina to focus on the Western Saudi government – focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by security forces in the past... five months," the state television spokeswoman of the Ministry of Interior said.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested to promote "Tacphirian thought" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and debris.
Among the detained were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate on Venus is likely to look at the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once be a pleasant place for life.
The data from the current European station show that the planet is even more similar to the twins of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbour of the world.
These two worlds are roughly as large and are orbiting similar trees, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions in Venus were similar to those on Earth and could also be inhabited.
But the exhausted greenhouse effect caused by carbon oxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower rotation rates sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to tail the oven and it breaks down the storms and winds with the power of the hurricane.
The findings from the European Space Agency Venus Express, one year studying the planet, offer a change of view of how the Earth could develop in case of disasterous climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the University of Oxford Physics Department and one of the leading missions Venus Express said: “It is increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is different from the Earth, although the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
“Our new data enables us to create a scenario in which Venus began as the Earth, perhaps with the population environment, billions of years ago.”
Police arrested "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was detained by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police spokeswoman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for a million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Still rounded
Mitt Romney said that the presidential candidates are not worth answering questions from the snowfall.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their video queries and transferred them to candidates to be sent.
None of the issues issued on Wednesday, November 28, were as comic as a snowman who asked Democrats for global warming in a debate on the other party on YouTube.
But this time many questions and answers have reflected on the status of the Republican party to the elections next year.
It is not clear how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, picked up clips that were then shown to the aspirant candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most powerful Republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of non-decisive voters to turn around when they heard something delighting: the voter recorded the tops of consent when the candidates spoke about a hard access to the border.
The hardest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giulianim, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who went forward in key quick votes in the Iove and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to embrace the reputation of a man who was soft to illegal immigrants as a New York Prime Minister.
He attacked Mr. Romney accusing former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two struggled particularly temporarily when taxpayers asked whether one of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
Additional candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, Congressman from Colorado, have been able to bring their little bit of mind on this topic.
No one of these two has the chance of nomination, but they both remain in the game probably because they have begun to beat threats because of immigration earlier and stronger than others.
At least immigration candidates have the same opinion: greater rigidity at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with the concerns of toys from China and other concerns about the surrounding world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the conflict between liberty and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it was on other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One potter asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani was convinced that, although the Bible is his favorite book, he wouldn’t believe literally the story of Jonah and the belly.
Another pocketer asked himself if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who is now against all assumptions in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism, said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to apply for laughter.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iova covers with recent successes in getting money and Ron Paul's voice-fearing joy in Wednesday's debate.
These two dismissed from the bottom because both sides are still unable to agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very early and convincingly with the winning report of American size on the mouth, sweating on both sides.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clarity.
Labourists' pain
Gordon Brown again found a trap that could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is a habit for British political scandals, this is not particularly pikant.
There appears to be some orders sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarried fingers were cancelled.
But Gordon Brown, who was barred, would turn around without finding that a wealthy entrepreneur, four years later, masked the Labour Party’s contributions of £650,000 (1.3 million) in the name of other people, and that the party did not announce it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by investigations, there was hope to ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of making it more and more funny, the representative of the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Brown once changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The Northern Rock problem bank’s unreliable rescue showed weaknesses in management and sharp punishment under the fire.
Misconsidered proposals for a change in the tax code combined companies against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unrepresentable administrative fraud.
Three generals in retirement started the rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against army expenses, because they claimed to be the commander of armed forces is part-time work.
Now there are many years of gifts from David Abraham; Peter Watt, the secretary-general of the labourists (and their former guard of internal discipline), has already resigned.
Nothing means that Mr. Brown would unrefundably go to his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a point of switching behind which they find government tough.
People don’t believe politicians and don’t like them, but mostly they will dismiss their disobedience when we take it over a new party.
When it appears clear that a prime minister will probably not improve anything, and maybe not be in the office for a long time, this removal is gone: the government becomes a fool, the ministers begin to do briefingy, the press looks for bad news and the government becomes unconcentrated and defensive.
In one direction, Mr. Brown’s position is particularly complicated, because, compared to other political leaders, you cannot take into account the position of a new bridge.
Whatever he would like to go away from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, Northern Rock problems and the Financial Office records are associated with the decisions Mr. Brown made as Finance Minister.
And even though he wasn't directly involved in blairov paintings, such as a long investigation into financing of political parties caused by "values for money", voters can quietly condemn that he was.
However, Mr. Brown's hatred is not as bad as they look.
They are not as terrible as the conservatives do.
With regard to Mr. Bean, no one died or was exposed to an excitement.
And treatment, no matter how painful it can be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s stalinist trends always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The latest breakthrough around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he did not want any advertising for his charity.
This may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew the procedure of Mr. Abrahams, but did not know he was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly interrogated; likewise Jon Mendlesohn, the main labourist money scanner, who learned about the tremendous gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not complicated yet; there is nothing that would indicate that he knew about these skins, even though the main part of the payments took place only after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly convicted this violation of law by his own party, but dissolved his determination by acting according to a good instrument, the Commission for the investigation of this matter - which will also lead to a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is the case of police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding an independent Permanent Chairman on Standards and Public Life, who has not had any more than six months, and dealing with a real reform of political party financing.
This would require laborers who are close to cooperate with the conservatives and maybe even give up their special financial relationship with the trade unions - high pills for the devoted party, such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent survey; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to make a victory is inconceivable integrity and high competence.
Caret bulbs
Does the U.S. credit card market affect the fraud mortgage crisis?
When there is blood in the water, naturally, they will begin to mix funeral floods excitingly around.
When the US real estate market is now shaking, the predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that losses on credit cards would be $99 billion if other variants of consumer loans were infected from fraudulent mortgage.
The signals of tension are obvious.
Increases the number of cases of inability to pay (for more than 30 days delays of payment) and deferred accounts (accounts that the provider considers to be inaccessible).
HSBC announced last month that it lost $1.4 billion on the U.S. consumer loan market – also due to non-solvent credit card loans.
However, panic is soon.
Rejected accounts and inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody's assessment agency, the inability to pay in the third quarter was almost the entire percentage point below the average.
The worsening measures can be partially explained for technical reasons.
The change in the U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Act of 2005 led to a steady decline in the number of reported bankrupts that make a large portion of losses on credit cards; therefore, the number of reports (and also the number of withdrawals) would rise regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders have deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good rate of expiry, which shows how many consumers pay monthly their debts.
And trust in securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup’s research company predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than the flooding.
Direct pathways for spreading the infection between the underlying mortgage crisis and the credit card market are definitely there: when they dry asset loans in real estate, consumers debts more than credit cards.
Credit card issuers rather look at cash flow than the values of handheld items, so falling house prices may not necessarily mean a change in lenders’ credibility.
They can even be beneficial for lending providers.
The motivation of consumers to pay the mortgage drops when the value of their assets drops below the value of the loan; as a result, debt on cards moves up on the list of priorities to pay.
Card issuers can also respond faster and more flexiblely to the conditions of storm than the hypothesis providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the price of handmade items.
“It won’t happen that we’d just review all the loans one morning,” says Gary Perlin, Financial Head of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subordinate mortgage is low, the risk of gradual weakening is much more realistic.
If lower home prices and debt reduction pushes America into recession, the credit card industry will stand in a darker future.
Be careful about those cemeteries.
British bankers admit guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who had to be judged for their role in fraud associated with the former financial leader Enron Andrew Fastowem, changed their declaration on Wednesday and confessed guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of seven fraud charges, when Fastowe and they had to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- to enrich themselves on their employers' accounts -- denied.
They had to stand before the court in January.
However, during the trial trial before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werleien Jr., everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former CEOs of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC units, figured on the main page for over two years, which lasted the issue.
In the United States, the case is one of the unlocked components of the investigation initiated by Enron's crash in 2001.
The accusation against them in 2002, Mr. Fastowa noted that it was the target of the government investigation into Enron's crash.
The prosecution against bankers -- who served the overname "NatWest Three" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to capture fraud along with Fastow and his former chief subsidiary Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in the Enron affiliate controlled by Fastowe, which was the architect of many Enron frauds that captured Enron in a spirale direction to disclose bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this branch zero, but our three British knew it had a significant value.
The company under the control of Kopper purchased the share of the banks in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for his share in this company.
According to Fastow, Enron falsely informed the energy company that it would pay $20 million for its share in Greenwich NatWest’s branch.
However, 20 million of them were actually British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers have received 7.3 million charges, and Fastow, Kopper and others have improved about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his guilt in two cases for his role in breaking Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in charge of a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in charge of a three-year punishment and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
All three British were free to pay $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, broke into bankruptcy in December 2001 after it was impossible to hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profits after years of accounting tricks.
The collapse cancelled thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market values and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Founder Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for his roles in the fall of the company.
Skilling is in execution of more than twenty-four years of punishment.
The judgments on Lay for confusion, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow non-power
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient fuel volume for non-stop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the rich Russians, however, they are small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But none of them cares about so many places because it is for a close family or business president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at Gulfstream's stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of a demonstrated consum in the mother's exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers have built their stands, who hoped that the freshly rich Russians would pull on everything from the mahagon-sized jackets to diamonds decorated to cars that would not be ashamed of even 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the nearby staircase.
"It's a nice car, but it's against us five and ten," he said.
According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.
On the waves of oil, the capital of Russia is shaking money as well as when it had its days in Dallas.
"We passed the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans were enormously rich and went to Europe where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth year listener at the Davis Center of Russian and Euroasian studies at Harvard.
As with the 70s and Japan's Saudis, the Russians became the world's most famous losers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Clondiku.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry Donatellu Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of the richest people, Forbes magazine has 53 billionaires with a total of $282 billion.
The local Institute for Economic and Financial Research also issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second" millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $670 billion.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005 15.8 % of Russians lived below the limits of the existence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, London's sales and marketing representative David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Every woman is intactly adjusted, and men are all for all treasures."
When they walked in evening dresses on Sunday evening hallami, twenty-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five-year-old Slightlana Turovkova and their customers have marked themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at this car and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumato, who was hanging in the brand dress as a veteran of red coppers, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home trail.
Veletrh seemed to be focused mainly on fresh, brand-controlled Russian shopping makers who are willing to sit down a few hours in the road traffic so they can walk through the warehouse which shouted mixture of Gun Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishermen, ice cream, Duven ice cream, ice cream, ice cream, ice cream, ice cream, ice cream, iced.
Free public members could buy tickets for €30 ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft staircase before reproducing Rembrandt's image of hand-painted blue calcium in lifetime size.
"Of course, the Russians are interested in more shirts."
And, in fact, here's the sellers say that Russians with old money (under Russian standards, they are 10-15 years old) have moved from the flashy logs to few known limited edition brands that would never appear on the shopping mall.
Even so many thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires embassy, or simply tourists, flood the majestic halls every day.
And some of them purchased.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, local bed manager King Koil, said he sold two mattress sets of cashmire and cotton, covered with golden nits, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, equipped high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold clear orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, said on Sunday afternoon that he sold three car networks in the style of connected chain belts for Rolls-Royce Phantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a car wheel designed for the Russian casino owner, which had to crash the Swarovski crystal coated in such a way that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four such.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a wheel of a strawberry skin or portrays his wives from a curved zirconium doesn't have to ride on those wheels yet," Karapetian said.
"He puts them in his garage for thirty-fourty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently does not mean anything very exclusive, due to the great rise in the prices of the real estate here.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper when not in cash anymore,” he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least preclude the wealth of a stake run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which is dealing with asset management.
The company attracted four red telephone bucks of the British style, a pillar of fake banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, marketing manager of the company, said his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for Veletrh Millionaires.
The cowards stopped to scatter around the crowd of money, or to let their friends take pictures of their friends by mobile phone, as they rest in the middle of the substitute wealth, or simply train their pockets a few million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by damaged operation
It was a day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked at the large windows of the restaurant here and watched a healthier sanitation that came to the White New England House for two houses after West Scott Avenue.
Soon the police guards joined the car.
And then another.
"I saw the delivery of the court doctor," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant controller.
"I knew at that moment that someone was dead."
The officials found that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant of the Newar Police Department.
The investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to the procedure carried out by an unlicensed plastic surgeon who refused to provide the police's identity, who worked at the house number 212 at West Scott Avenue.
Offices have not yet found what caused Mrs. Arroy’s death, and hope that toxicological tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness to the head of the Newar police.
Mrs. Arroy has been assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many at the department.
"She was loyal, loving, and worked hard," McCarthy told Mrs. Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"It was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newar police officer working for the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsh, Union District State Representative, Theodora J. Romankova, said that detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died from the consequences of unlicented surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"The investigation is still underway."
The officials said they arrived at home about three hours in the afternoon.
In November, they found Mrs. Arroy on the sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week later, the authorities still told little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is claimed to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had listened to Mrs. Castr.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as an order.
On Wednesday in the house of Mrs. Castrová, with a decayed pink cherry in the garden and a dalmatin screwed back, no one responded
In addition to the doors that led to the cloak, he sat in the open garage blue bar with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain wheels on one side of the hills.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived at the New York Police Department for 25 years in Newark, Mrs. Arroy gave him an invaluable assistance in exploring an intolerant and tight political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful about this or this,'" she said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was crazy."
Hope that the Fed will lower interest rates, leads to strengthening world exchanges
The prices of shares on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday rose after market hopes that the Federal Bank will try to calm down lending conditions by further reducing interest rates were reinforced by the reassuring statements of the U.S. Vice-President Central Bank.
In London, New York, and across Europe, after Donald Kohn, the second in rank after Ben Bernank, President Fed, said, in response to the continued pressure on the financial markets, leaders must be "flexibly and pragmatic".
Within the obvious efforts to calm the irritated markets in the midst of the signs of the livelihood of credit efforts, Kohn said that recent explosions "particularly reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets by the end of September and in October".
He added that if increased instability continues, the possibility that the financial conditions of households and businesses will be further worse.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to add further fresh amounts of capital to the U.S. markets, and perhaps further reduction of interest rates to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm down Wall Street in the middle of other bad news about the U.S. economy, when the sale of apartments in October showed recordly low numbers.
Bear Stearns announced that it would cancel 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, as part of a reduction in costs due to the compensation of severe losses caused by non-pronounced wages on subordinate housing loans in the United States.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed to 13 289.40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, i.e. 2.7 percent, and closed to 6 306.2, with the value of British blue chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, the credit voltage on the market showed full strength after the auction of the European Central Bank’s three-month cash packages had been borrowed by the European Commercial Banks at a rate of 4.7%, which is the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the British Bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and release overstandard money on the London monetary markets has increased by increasing the rates of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" after an uncontinued growth from November 12 to its maximum at the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who will be number six for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context about nothing less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is going to make this decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the President of the Election Commission, who holds the best position at this point in the lending time, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision-making of the national aid, and because the table of Hugh Morris, the chief manager of the English team, would not take the choice of the English team.
Whoever will not be built on the sixth place will be unhappy, but life is often not fair, and sports are not at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets at the top of his profession, while someone else never gets through a lower level, sometimes because of the lack of happiness rather than the ability.
Not only in the cricket, the choice is demanding and requires an assessment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move upstairs?
Is it fair to Shah, if yes?
In the same way, we could ask ourselves in another area, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good education and an overview in the field, should be upgraded to the committee - the place is just for one.
Who should say what level is right for cricketers if they don't have a chance to fall down or swim on the next one?
Of course, the numbers have a great impact on decision-making, but they have the same opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain's view at the right time whether he should take a wicket, and the burner needs regular chances at starting positions, whether he should sometimes make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Take a look at the candidate is more complicated.
For example, last season was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test appears to be sure, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and found himself a shooter.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first-class at 33 runs on each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same hidden diameter, but both had their moments at the highest level and hoped in the next.
If he plays at the Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can be just a matter of opinion.
The choice can either extend or affect your career both, or may not have a great influence.
Four years ago at Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class gave good performances, five wickets and 40 leisure movements, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, which is also a point, although he still recorded two times under Australia.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion on the clean training of the Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and give Sha's greater experience in Bopar's youthfulness.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks of his debut debut Test exchanges at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first grade compared to six Bopars, who, at the age of twenty, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin overheads.
However, Shah did in two exchanges in May against the Caribbean in Test on Lord's, his hometown in Middlesex, just ten moves, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to reobsess him to another match, his defeat seemed to have taken something out of the elbow.
In contrast, the Essex universal has joy to live in kostes.
On the Cricket Square, nothing takes him away, and his behaviour outside the Square symbolizes a newly reversed car with a four-wheel drive on the day of the exhibiting car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He tied with light injuries and probably shocked, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (perhaps also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his co-player, who refrained to watch it to ask him excitedly, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed sweater overheads on the hills here that appear to be suitable for him, distributes effectively, and burns off self-confidence and manually.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is different.
Maybe that's the real art of choosing.
Personally, I'm closing to get Bopara's chance now, but I don't want to say that Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea tickets indicate, that's the one who's going to play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to come to Baghdad last night, asking refugees who came out of money or expired the time of the visa, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight against the armed forces who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansur bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy with a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubajsi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and about what I read in the newspapers, because of what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, thinking of the Shiite militia of the militant spiritual Muktadi al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to interrupt the fight.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eighteen-year-old Shiite teacher from the main Sunni region of Amarijah, returned with his two children because he could no longer restore the Syrian visa and because the regime had not allowed Iraqis to work there.
His Shiite neighbours in Amaria called him to help the local defence with the support of the U.S. Army pushing al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital and urging him to return.
One of the newly reborn Jordan is the leader of Sunni and Shiite stones, whose home in Sleikhu in northern Baghdad avoided a granate attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“A few of my friends called me and told me that he was leaving the Sleikhu militia against al-Qaeda and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said 20-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken about the attraction of peace in the capital after strengthening the US military presence and the growth of local "groups of occupied citizens" that arms in their hands on the side of the US army prevent their neighborhood.
But he said more about the fact that the return of the visa and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have escaped in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a fifty-year-old father of three children, expressed a suspicion sharing between refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visa of refugees and forced them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi Sectarian killers.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving visa to Iraqis to have to return to Iraq," the Sunni retirement said.
"I can't believe the government that supports criminals who burned me after I left my house."
A partial reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that sunny ones were expelled from Shiite regions and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are concerns that the sudden flow of refugees will again break down the sectarian voltage and will lead to another battle.
Little Saraska, good education
Germany’s smallest federal country plays a leading role in vocational education, excels even with the international focus of its high schools.
Only in one educational area is concerned with the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
“A man who is not from Sarajevo, I explained yesterday after fifty that we are no French,” this self-ironical password appears in Sarajevo at the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
In addition, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar education system, which is the fifth place in the monitoring of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Colleges are traditionally closely cooperating with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in France in 1948.
To date, students can finish their studies with a double or even three-three degree.
That corresponds to a relatively high share of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
Because the over-average number of Sara’s children is accepted at high school - many of them even without studying at gym.
"In Sarajevo, a professional education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW education expert.
By obtaining more than every five teenagers permission to study at a professional school, Sarajevo is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarajevo to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities of studying two areas are in view of the number of inhabitants the second best in all Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and growing demand, the number of graduates of engineering declined by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saar Ministry of Education has now ordered high schools to create a promotional campaign for engineering districts.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have made several reforms at general educational schools," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore implemented comparison tests throughout Germany.
In order to begin learning as soon as possible, last year's maternal school is free - a model that other federal countries take over.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will be shown up to future comparison studies.
In the 2003 Pisa study, the share of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the United States did not improve as much as other federal countries.
Bowlers can count better.
And to be disappointed by the Sara’s Pisa study does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Sara’s could be a point in this area.
The language of the neighbours is mandatory for gyms - even though the inhabitants of Sarajevo are not French.
The head moves the watches
What you can’t see will take hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will leave the clock in this South American country half an hour ago.
In Spain, there is a ridiculous figure from Chavez.
Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that the hours would move to a minimum of four and a half hours, according to the new law.
The South American state will be this step in the time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Understanding, an enemy of the United States, justified his decisions, among other things, by entering the United States’ distribution of time zones throughout the world.
In the middle of local time, Chávez also announced that, due to the cause of the ruins, the relationship with neighbouring Colombia is interrupted.
The left nationalist said Alvaro Uribe would not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government as long as he was conservative.
"I can't, because of my self-esteem," said Chávez, who promotes a constitutional reform, about which the citizens of this oil country must vote in a Sunday referendum.
This reform would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels on the release of arms.
Uribe was "in the face of Venezuela" by his decision, he criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
Also in Spain, everyone is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile call here triggered an interruption: Why no te callas (Why are you no longer silent?) - so sounds a phrase that has been removed from the internet for over half a million people.
It was spoken by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American summit, the voices of this left-wing populist were shattered so much that he was silent in this way.
Germans are at risk of lower payouts in 2007
This year, German employees are at risk of reducing real salary despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts have justified their pessimist prediction for a number of reasons.
According to the Hanse Böckler Foundation estimates, employees can actually count on getting lower wages than last year.
"Wine is a small increase in wages, increase in added value tax and increase in food and energy prices," said Bild Gustav Horn from the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforsschung).
New burden on employees may also be expected in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable for the new year.
However, the federal labour agency should no longer fall into such hate that the federal youth should require loans or contributions, cited the newspapers of this social-democratic policy.
It was announced on Tuesday that the price of food and oil products has caused inflation to its highest state in the last thirteen years.
In the annual comparison, prices totally increased by three percent.
Venus is a twin in hell.
In spite of his life’s enemy atmosphere, the Venus Earth is more similar than it was expected. The European Venus Express space sonda on Venus recorded phenomena that appear in the winter on Earth: lightning atmospherics and winding beliefs on the fields.
For nearly three decades, scientists know that Venus has been blaming.
Now the European Venus Express sondage has brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus flying flashes from the cloud to the cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the formation of the original substance, life could be created on Earth thanks to brilliance. The storms allegedly provoked reactions in oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
There was no such thing in Venus: “If there was ever life there, it had to have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about 100 times dense than the Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"It's probably a hell twin, but it's a twin," Russel said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth’s dark and size, began to develop completely differently, is the basic issue of Esa’s mission.
Since since the early 1990s no sondage has been sent exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest research findings that approached several articles of Nature magazine did not only emphasize Venus’ uniqueness in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighbouring planet is more similar to Earth than it was expected," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind beliefs in the northern pole, scientists found dark faith in the southern pole, which rotates substantially faster.
This phenomenon resembles air flows in the northern hemisphere, a research team written by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of our solar system is almost the same matter as the Earth and with an average of 12,100 km is almost the same.
This planet called the Sea or the Nightmare will circle the Sun in less than 225 days.
However, it turns its own axis much slower. One day on Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus is not remembered at a surface temperature of 460 °C and at a pressure of 92 bars on Earth, scientists believe that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
The waters gathered together, but on the earth remained in the oceans, while from Venus the universe was evaporated.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is tied in carbonates on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for the end of party disputes for the acceptance of the Dalaikams in the Chancellor's office.
Indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany’s reputation and calls for a large coalition to end the crash around the acceptance of Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves as a nation that is not united in this matter," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to adopt Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
However, the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany has to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not prevent him from stopping Merkel when it was calculated to create a new policy against China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not leave China's traditional politics.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) expressed his indirect disagreement with the acceptance of Dalai Lama and was attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the "previous" foreign policy of the coalition.
After the Dalai Lama's receipt in the Chancellor office, German-Chinese relations have deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministry of both countries.
China’s President Wen Jiabao called for Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that Dalai Lama’s acceptance was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao emphasized the position of China.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibet regions, also located in China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns from similar concerns in France
Wolfgang Schäuble warns from similar anxiety that broke out in France.
We have to do our best to prevent social discontent in Germany from growing in street violence, the Federal Interior Minister calls for.
The barricades were fired, the kidnappers were shot by police officers. After the serious concerns of youth in France, the Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We must be careful that there is no such social tension in our lives as well as in violence.
We have to take it seriously,” said Neue Press in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to solve problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we have recorded the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
Last night, youths with the police in the northern suburbs of Paris celebrated a hard street fight.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
More integration efforts by the German government have requested the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to the concerns in France, Kolat warned from the "small effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
The Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "averagely high".
First of all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
"We have to give youth hope."
However, the President of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
In addition, many young people from the families of migrants do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
The wheel said, "We have to be careful."
We need to allow youths to start working and learn.
In the meantime, she stayed the night in the district of Villiers-le-Bel in Paris.
Hundreds of police officers were in place, and the helicopter flew over the area with lights.
Authorised authorities reported three arrests and several burned waste baskets and cars.
Since yesterday, there are about 1,000 settled order forces in peace.
The police will interfere as long as necessary, said after visiting Michelle Alliot-Marie's Deputy Secretary of Interior.
About 80 police officers were injured in the troubles at Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, Toulouse’s anxiety was overwhelmed.
It has caused an accident on Sunday, in which two youths have died.
According to the state’s initial findings, police have no blame for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angely "Oblacks"
The Chancellor’s real-time remote output documents that the coalition is programmer at the end and that we can’t expect anything more from it.
In what country does this Chancellor actually live?
According to her unwilling, disproportionate and contentiously poor presentation in the general debate of the Parliament, we must note: not here - not in this country that she should ultimately manage.
In the sense that he is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once answered a very arrogant sentence.
It's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what critics are talking about.
In the House of Commons, she clearly showed everyone how much she deserved that excuse.
There was no real interest in Merkel, not even in the country’s problems.
Instead, Angela "Oblakova" was presented: a policy that exhibits over others that rains into foreign policy and even there expresses itself only smoothly.
For example, climate protection: it is no longer praised for the conclusions arising from the Heiligendham summit, but it is no longer saying how to achieve certain climate goals in Germany.
And, at all, such a self-sacrificing - so much disgrace would have forgiven the CDU President two years ago.
It is now limited to the planets of phrases that could increase its popularity among people.
This approach harms its image of pragmatics that do not need to lie because it solves problems.
But in the empire of Angely "Oblacks" the internal political problems are an end-to-end issue.
Child poverty and concerns of people with low wages?
A few other words on these topics were left.
It is worth noting how often Merkel says when it comes to child supplements.
Merkel has to start three times from the beginning to be able to speak at least partially the right sentence.
As soon as things start to be very concrete, they are crushed as in an entirely foreign land.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube was dismissed in a hard discussion in the case of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorites - and both now have to worry about outsider candidates.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first subject.
Mitt Romney predicts his opponent, Rudy Guilianim, to make New York an "attaque for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp speeches: "I believe his own house was just one such refugee," he says, and predicts to former governor Massachusetts that he employed immigrants with no documentation.
Since the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates use these debates at CNN mainly to discredit their competitors.
Half-minute, Internet users recorded and transmitted through Youtube videos only serve as such help on the key topic.
"We have enabled Hitler to strike power through such a policy of isolationism," John McCain predates his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one to promote immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain does not save Romney for refusing to condemn a tortured method of hearing called "Waterboarding" when heating is simulated.
The responses of the audience in St. Petersburg show that among the important topics of the campaign are neither war in Iraq nor methods of torture.
The municipality falls into the potles whenever conservative values are praised and the future tax increases are rejected.
This shows where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“I’ve been wrong then,” Romney said, asking a side base and a television audience for forgiveness because he was still a suspender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is disappointed when it is to be expressed to the literal Bible interpretation.
Musharaf ruled for the first time in civilian
On the day after his resignation as the Supreme Commander of the Army, Pakistani ruler Musharaf made a presidential oath.
This ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Parvíz Mušaraf made a presidential oath on Thursday and remains in the presidential office for five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live a ceremony held in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharaf swore to honor the Constitution and to strive for the prosperity of the nation.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Commander of the Army handed his office over to his trustee Ashfaq Kiyani, which underwent international pressure, particularly by the United States.
Eight years after a non-blowing military shift, former general ruled for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning from the position of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharaf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the cancellation of the exceptional state, which Mušaraf declared on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyuma, Musharaf will cancel an exceptional state shortly after his oath, thus fulfilling the requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Mušaraf, after declaring an exceptional status at the beginning of November, held him by awarded lawyers, rejected all objections to the controversial reelection of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed during the attack on a military convoy in the Northern Vasilian tribe area and four others were injured.
The spokeswoman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The father's krautrock returns
The famous German group of the 1970s plays again, and three members of the Harmonia group resumed their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, sisters of the band's most successful period.
At the time, they were far more familiar abroad.
The announcement of the sensation then consists of the appearance of three sitting ladies, who at first look like just enjoying dinner.
Everybody has a box, cables and mainly buttons in front of them.
The thirty-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in the middle of the snowy shirt.
After his left is Michael Rother, seventy-year-old, who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, a thirty-seven-year-old, who focuses on the synthesator, is from the viewpoint of the audience to the right.
Everybody sings sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, with a lack of action, a traditional song will be created.
It doesn’t seem too much to the musicians.
Among the lovers of the krautrock, the Harmonian teams were revived by a significant breakdown.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective consciousness of the pope, but it is certainly not so running away that someone will lose this band for twenty-three years painfully.
But why couldn’t the German celebrate his still living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when you take a musical style, a miscalculated krautrock, in England and America, it is worth more than in your own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the remaining members of the Colin Can Group the Echo Award for Lifework, the room was full of sharp views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the admiration of the audience no longer knew the border.
Michael Rother later sat at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts with them on the floor as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
By remembrance of the Harmony series, we unnecessaryly overwhelm the memory, that this trio existed only two years, and at that time no effect was as far as others later assigned to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster.
They were originally played in the Berliner Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons in the gramofon company led by the church.
Rother shortly helped Kraftwerk, but he gained a reputation as a guitarist in the Neu! series, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster band to the exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the 16th-century ruins of the Old Weserhof, they lived as members of the municipalities who fled from the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still able to steal as a thief.
It was rather life in such a spitzweg artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the singing assembly of Harmonia Ottenstein, whose character is allegedly found in the bathroom.
Many of them maintained harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonie" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, she suffered financial difficulties.
The collection of roses was not merely self-recognition.
Now released the CD "Live 1974" said it was cut in front of a recordly small, hardly fifty-year-old cult at the concert in Griessem.
Rothera then expressed the desire for the members of Harmony to be defeated and exercised occasionally.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a totally disobedient requirement.
In 1975, the chapel announced its separation.
Rother ended in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "Burn Heart".
The Chapel Cluster lived again in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia had ever been.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyero.
His recording company Grönland has taken as a goal to provide Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Kapela Neu! was regarded as Roedeli's solo work at the time.
Harmony’s body resurrection will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The exhibition at Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Brit, Julian Cope, an old pancakes and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual will be present.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, is also involved.
We planned the overall spread of the impact of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled with Harmonia.
Briana Ena’s grandmother, accompanied by the most amazing sounds, is raised in the hall: “The only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are pictures on which the producer is in harmony in the agriculture headquarters.
It also contributes to the creation of the legend by spreading other black and white photographs on which there are a set of wild-connected cables.
The three veterans were once again employed by improvisation.
No longer sticking microphones to the stoves and bubbles so that out of the tools they have never heard of self-made tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technique of degradation of the pointers.
There is no change in the House of World Cultures.
Under the guidance of Barbary Morgenstern, he climbs under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place he emphaticly sings "Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It's never about rock.
Rather than blues, we would find roots at music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia is not allowed to come out of peace.
Even the most obvious thing is to be thoroughly reflected on the scene.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question either prepares for the nerves or helps him to experience mixable moments of happiness.
Richard Gere isn't quite cynic.
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden have released two films about the Balkan war.
But none of them are convincing.
The film pattern either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too impressive.
The Hunting Party does not prevent him from being an actor like Richard Gere.
Good news as the first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the cloudy background of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere will crash.
Recently, we have lost this most beautiful man from the 1980s, not only because he played in many beautiful, undesirable roles in comfortable women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the theme of Buddhism, people will taste another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the hunter becomes the race (why the names of films today must be so long and upset?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically the one who could become if the fate and film industry weren't so compassionate: a man who has his best years back for a long time, but as a careful monument still maintains a certain remarkable charm.
The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, who also enters the movie this week, is only continuing an endless series of failed films on the Balkans war.
This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save the Serbian girl from a Kosovo shooter, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is honourable that the Serbians are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this TV-fire film is changing too soon in shooting and action.
There will be something similar to the Cobra 11 series without a road, but for the war.
In The Hunting Party, it is possible to explore why the Balkan War has not been able to film a really good movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who appear to be a "different", Serbian top war criminal, could, at another time and under the leadership of another director and scenario (there are both Richard Shepard) become a new "Apokalypse".
Both stories are surprisingly like: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army cannot do, but their way becomes a way of madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the film The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not an infamous and sentimental cynic at the beginning.
On the contrary, the presentation prescribes a romantic affair with a later killing a Bosnian Muslim.
The film The Hunting Party can ultimately reject after reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film have led to what NATO, the CIA and all criminal hunters in the world have failed in the last five years: catching criminals and leaving him a fair vengeance of Bosnian Muslims.
It is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the Hague International Court.
This film has a deep human message.
It condemns that Karadice and Mladić are still free, and suspects that the Americans and French (here they are exceptionally united) are not devoted to persecution under secret political agreements quite intensely.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar to women who are attacked by Brecht's famous poem.
It relates to the wooden mask of the Asian demon at the writing desk of the writer: "With compassion, I look at the swelling veins on the front, noting: how ambitious it is to be evil."
In films such as The Hunting Party, they show exactly the same heads, but they indicate how ambitious it is to be good.
This problem is not limited only to the theme of the war in the Balkans.
In recent newspapers, all Hollywood films about Iraq have been great failures.
One can be added: There has never been a good movie about South Africa before.
Almost always is true: when the star falls after a crisis zone or goes through a mining field, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the border with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCapri will be created.
Maybe all of these conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to take decades before Hollywood could play a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must obviously be matured - movies that are today considered to be classical Vietnamese works - "hunger of ashes", "apocalypse" or "Old Vesta" - were not celebrated at that time in any case as a masterpiece.
But maybe today, when every mass murder appears at home on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The scripts do not have the ability that is necessary to make good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terriblely the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe a person shouldn't want to be good when he wants to make good movies.
Perhaps he has to create a sarcasticly measured artistic view as a novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was touched on the parallel between his historic novel "Lempriers dictionary" and "The Balkan War," he stated: "The confusion is only in the fact that some things never change.
Great cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust criticizes for rejecting the Olympics
The resignation of the mayor from the organizing of the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has resulted in a sharp criticism of politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the organizing of water games.
Von Beust, however, urges realism in an estimate of chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the main dealer of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, marked this decision on Wednesday "in terms of business as unhappy".
No other project has recently awakened in the city as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
Without this goal, it would be impossible to maintain this sports political enthusiasm to such a high degree.
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but created a new long-term concept for him, "which is based on a changed schedule."
Starosta Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his earlier statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistical by 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union decides about the Olympic candidate," von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide the Munich candidate for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference for us means that we have no realistic opportunity with the timeplan counting 2028.”
This dream has not yet ended," said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) marked von Beusto's statements as regrettable.
It will be the impression that Hamburg does not want to go on the Olympics in the next twenty-five years.
"It's too soon to destroy ourselves by calling the plans as buried at this early stage," said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
The denial would be in contradiction with the statement of the head of the Senate sent to the General Assembly of the General German Higher Education Sports Association.
Von Beust has not announced Hamburg's candidate for the University in 2015 as a refund for the Olympics.
The University Sports Union of Hamburg has been nominated as a candidate for the city last week.
The SPD fraction in the Hamburg Parliament Senate concluded that it wasted a valuable time that could be used for building apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook region has been braked by the Senate for years because it has bet on the organizing of the Olympics and excluded the construction of apartments," SPD Members Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region still planned the Olympics with the fact that the entire area will be used later for apartment purposes, CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympics were a great excitement in Hamburg.
Hamburk, but it's in the Lipsk.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
The one who combines the terms of Sweden and wooden beans does not mean Andy Warhol, but Ikeu.
Or yes?
Wooden beans currently manufactured in Sweden are thrown into Warhol’s list of dark shadows.
Most of his ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of Stockholm are false.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the trueness of Warhol "Brillo boxes" from 1968, the internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm comes with the result that brought the division of the international; the six of the "Brillo boxes most" markets of the other, which in 1995 are the "Brillo boxes most" markets of the Museum of Moderna Museet, which was also used to be the "covery".
The previous events are a chain of artistic and curative events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden beans, which were based on the red-white design of paper boxes of Brillo butter powder.
The exhibition of his works at Moderna Museet in 1968 presented hundreds of Brillo’s cartons, with Warhol’s consent. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about artistic works, it was about their paintings, only exhibition pieces.
Warhol also granted permission in 1968 to make several Brillo wooden beans in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses are now talking about the fifteen beans, which were then right into the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" labeled Type Stockholm.
Some of them were raised at auctions for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968, some hundred badges were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol left him.
In fact, 105 Hulten beans were made in Malmö for an exhibition in Petrohrad only in 1990.
Warhol was in the past three years after his death.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, explored besides six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were built in Sweden in 1968, and after their cross-border plates were pinned with a white-colored bar.
In contrast, the structure of the copies of 1990 showed that the color was applied directly by the paint role without the previous basic paint - in addition to acrylic and not oil color.
"These beans were not authorized by an artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list," Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet, said: "If the organization of Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to other conclusions, the Modern Museet will have to be copied from its ranks."
In July, the Authentication Board announced that these "stretched charges" which were raised in the case of a box with myrrh powder will be addressed.
The organization is still in a quiet silence.
Insurgents in Manila resign
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers resigned to a hotel in Manila and requested the resignation of President Glorie Macapagal Arroy.
Insurgent commander Antonio Trillanes, who forced the president to manipulate and corruption in the elections, told the hotel reporters that he refused responsibility for blood prolific.
Soldiers committed to the government before attacking the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers were arrested in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court due to a devastated attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his 30 sympathists.
Military police officers who were supposed to guard him, apparently crossed his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and requested the resignation of President Glorie Macapagal Arroy.
The government's loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called for an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, National Security Advisor, has condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Triallnes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers, said that other military units will join the race in a short time.
Critics urged the government to hold a large demonstration against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been incurred in corruption.
In 2003, Manilla’s financial area became the main event of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroy.
Because she refused to join the rebels, the rebellion collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, the Philippines has attempted at least seven times to destroy a democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatelu
The United Internet has secured more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05 % of the basic share capital.
It was previously speculated about taking over.
The company continues to count on the possibility of further increasing its share in Versailles.
United Internet has announced that this step is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its share in this Düsseldorf network operator's company by another 5% to 15.1%, entry agreements appeared on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
The United Internet at Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications provider, has already shared nearly 10%.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has sold additional 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
Of which, 5.15 million shares have been purchased for 31.4 million Euro United Internet.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in DSL products and mobile networks together.
“We strengthen our partnership,” said United Internet spokeswoman.
In order to take over the competitive Freenet, the companies together established a joint venture to SMEs.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies are currently satisfied with a share of more than 10% in Freenet and do not exercise their right to take over another 18.49% of the company.
It is believed that companies have remained open to all options, especially the possibility to further increase their share in Freenet AG.
Interviews between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were ended in mid-November.
This monthly and difficultly transparency game on Freenet is part of the German telecommunications market consolidation.
Freenet had 2.9 million contractual customers on the mobile network and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection at the end of the third quarter.
Holding United Internet and Drillische currently hold 6.01% share in FreeNet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will receive approximately 4% more.
The right to purchase 18.49 % of Vatas’ investment was agreed in August.
