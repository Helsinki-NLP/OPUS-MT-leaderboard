Sekretaris of the Commission of the Assembly, who is now developing a project of Law on the Elimination of Changes to Name, declare: "The initial decision on any description of what deputates of the East call will be, naturally, question of members themselves."
The Law on the Authority of Wales from 2017 gives the Valilian East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission publicated the results of a National Consultation on Proposals, in which a wide support for the calling of the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of an additional deputy, the Commission has preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales or CPU, but the option of CPU has obtained the largest support during public consultations.
Additional Deputys, obviously, offer alternative options, but the way of reaching consensus could become a headache for senior, Elin Jones, who is supposed to present the bill of change in a few weeks.
The Reform Acts will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, e.g. rules on disqualification of additional deputy and changes in structure of the system of committees.
Additional deputy will make final vote on the question of how they should be called when they execute their statutory work.

Sainsbury's plans to go to the British Market of Beauty
Sainsbury's will work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening sections with beauty goods in universities where there will be working the foot specialists.
As part of a substantial prosperity in the UK market of beauty with protection of 2,8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion clothing and household goods are redus, the sales of goods are devastated by the bestsellers, the larger houses of beauty in the new countries will be represented in the following 11 posts
Investments in beauty are because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the place in the police, which were previously occupated by TVs, microwave cups and goods for the house.
Sainsbury's has stated that it would double volume of beauty goods, offering up to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in corporate departments similar to that which can be found in stores like Boots.
Big stores also restart their line line of cosmetics Boutique, so the majority of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend becomes increasingly needed among young buyers.
In addition, a Fragrance Shop parfum shop will test the case in two stores of Sainsbury's, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second open in Saley Square (Birmingham) in the end of this year.
Online Shopping and transition to buy a small number of products every day in local stores near home leads to the fact that supermarkets have to do more effort to make more attractive for visitors.
Mike Cupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that trading points will be increasingly similar to university, as a network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi Aldi, Lidl dealerships, using a large number of services and low cost goods.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos trading points in hundreds of stores, as well as has posted a few pieces Habitats from time when two years ago he acquired both networks, which, according to him, has contributed to the growth of sales of food products and made more gains.
Preliminary attempt of supermarkets to reconstructe their beauty departments and pharmacy has failed successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share income from pharmacy shops ended after a series of distributions in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold his pharmacy business three years ago together with the 281 store Celesio owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's pharmacy network for 125 million pounds.
It was reported that Lloyds played his role in this plan, expanding assortment of luxurious brands in care of skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We also invested in training our employees, who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our assortment of brands is developed with account of any needs, and atractive setting and convenient location make us a better house of beauty that will resist the old way of shopping.”

This is an intolerance to those who expresse their measurement
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted for me to panic, it's just a surprise or it's a surprise.
I am the last in a number of parlementarians from the Labour Party, who say that we are not welcomed – everything to express our measurement.
May's colleague by parliament Joan Ryan received an analogous opposition, because it resolve antisemitism resisting antisemitism.
In my case, the censor explained to me that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of the responsibility of the economic policy, of the national security, of Europe, of irony of fate is similar questions, about which Jeremy has not agreed with the previous leaders.
In a statement on the meeting, which was held Friday by the Northeast Labour Party of Nottingham East Labour, said that “we want these meetings to be mixed and productive.”

Lamentablement, today's meeting tone is not so and promise "better good, more soft" politics long forgetted if really really was ever ever.
This becomes increasingly evident, that in the labourist party different opinions are not allowed, and every measurement is evaluated from one side of the view whether it is acceptable for the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, because colleagues, with whom I thought I shared the same political views, started waiting to take a step back, and took positions that I wouldn't think I wouldn't be aligned with the marketplace - I tried to make a marketplace.
I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure.
This is not just my experience.
I know that it is better for me than for some of my companions, because the comments on me, as a rule, are political.
I am admirated of professionalism and resolution of those colleagues who are confronted with the flow of sexuality or racism, but they are never involved.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
"Last week, Jeremy Corbin affirmed that the Liberal Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
We are not anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious, we are anxious.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years that invited me not to fall into spirit, not to be so sound, and then everything will be in order with me.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

I have never hid my political views, including the number of elections past.
Nobody in East Nottingham could be confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who struggled for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, if the country is headed to Brexit, which brings injury to the domestic owner, the enterprises, and our government service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and strength for my returnability. Leadership
but in fact, the only mission I have, - it's not Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, it's my voters, it's will be members of the labourist, or not: I'm embarrassed with that I serve you, and I promise that no threat of cancellation elections will be a threat of the elections will not be anxious to me, and the political objective of all

Robin Krishti from Melrovez said: "Don't give the right Air, he's got more courage than we."
14-minute Grant Andersen, transformed by Fraser Climate, put Ire in front plan, but yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, received for Warriors game, allowed Melorez to sing the numbers, and Jayson Baggot is not going to escape.
Climates extended Eira's leadership with a pencil, before, directly in the stop, he killed, and then made a salt trial, making 17-5 Eira's stop.
But Melrovis a good started the second half, and Patrick Andersen, converted to Bagot, turbulented the retreat to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Roaryd Not, which was stretched, and after the restart, Air progressed further through Stafard McDowell's trial, Climate implemented.
Air, executing the obligations of Captain Blair McFerson, received a yellow card, and Melrovez again forced another man to pay with Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of February press.
However, lords returned, and when Strowen Hattchinson received a yellow card for that he broke out Climate without ball from the line of penalty, McFerson was arrogant behind Eura.
Climates have implemented their attempts, which they have done again almost after restart, after Kyle Row received the attack of David Armstrong in the penalty and sent the flag of Gregory Henry to the fifth attempt of field masters.

But some analitiks think that the Court of Bolivia would make a decision for Bolivia, and that's a little bit to change, even if he's doing so.
The United Nations Organization based in the Netherlands has no right to make a decision on the territory of Chili and has stated that it will not determine the source of possible talks.
The fact that the Constitution of the International Court of Justice proceeds only six months after considering the final arguments, proves that the matter "was not complicated", - said an expert in the International Law of Paz Zarat.

North Korea declares that nuclear disclosures will not occur until they can trust the United States
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea R. Yang Ho says that his country will never stop using his nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri prosecuted Saturday at the General Assembly of AAN.
He invited the United States to fulfil the promises achieved during the summit in Singapore among the leaders.
Its comments come like the United States. The Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, similarly, is situated on the border of restoration of atomic diplomacia from North Korea Kim Chen Inm over three months after Singapore .
"It's a "mart of great greatness" to continue sanctions and repression of the United States against declaration of the end of war in Korea will ever place North on the knee.
Washington fears to agree with the declaration, if Pyongyang initiativly not break down significant steps of the discovery.
Kim and President Donald Trump need to hold a second summit.
But there is a great skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang seriously take to the rejection of the arsenal, which country probably considers as the only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the next month to prepare for the second summit "Kim-Trump".

John Edward: Knowledge of Language - This is the necessary skills for all the citizens of the world
Independent Schools of Scotland maintain achievement in academic success, it continues since 2018 with another excellent outcome of exams, which is enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other beginnings.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools, represented by the Scotland Independent School Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further higher education, selected by their names of career and their place as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and implement a individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desired items in schools.
Neelsan Mandellah: "If you're talking to a person in a language that he understands, this remains in his head.
If you're talking to him in his own language, that's going to his heart."
It's a clear reminder that we can't trust only in English, if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the recent exams of this year, we see that languages occupy the first place in the league tables with the highest indicators of accounts in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher mark A.
Data collected in 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 per cent of the students reached higher class A in studying Chinese language, while 72 per cent – those who study German, 69 per cent – French, also – French, and 63 per cent – Auschwitz, and 63 per cent – Auschwitz.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital vital skills, which certainly need children and youth in the future.
Languages are now selected as a subject as the subjects of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curriculums of independent schools and other places.

So, more and more language skills become a necessity to prepare young people for future career.
Having in mind more perspective workplaces that require knowledge of languages, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Whatever the profession you choose, when you learn another language, it will become a real advantage in the future, when you are going to have such skills throughout your life.
Opportunity to contact directly with people from other countries automatically place multilingual person in the first place among the competitors.

The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, gives children more chances to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will vary according to the languages in which it is taught.
Several schools will concentrate on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain in view of the future until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what interest your child, in independent schools will always be a choice of several languages with a teacher complex, which is specialists in this field.
The Scottish independent schools will endeavour to provide an environment of education, which will prepare the children and arm their skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what will be in the future.
"Now it is impossible to say that in the global business environment languages still have vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, the modern languages must be considered as “kompetence of international relations”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and preference for young Scotland.
This should be done

North Korea says that "no way" will be decomposed in one-party order without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said that Saturday, the United Nations Organization continues sanctions that strengthen the incompetence of the United States, and in such conditions the country cannot reject nuclear weapons in a single order.
Ri Yun Ho deklarated at the annual General Assembly of the World Organ Organ, that last year North Korea has adopted "significant measures of good will", e.g., stop testing in nuclear and missile areas, demontage nuclear zone testing and nuclear zone demontage and promising not spreading
"Not we can't see the corresponding response from America's side", he said, "we can't see the corresponding response from America's side."
"I'm not confident in the US will not be sure in our national security, and in such circumstances, there's no way in the first place in the one-side order to decompose itself."
Despite the fact that Ri republicated ordinary complaints of North Korea against Washington to the “paetage” approach to dinuclearization, within which North Korea was awarded awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awarded by awards
Ri was saved on a joint statement by Kim Chan Chan Yn and Donald Trump on the first in history of the summit of President of USA and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the way to "denuclearization of Korean Kings."
North Korea is trying to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States stated that Pyongyang should initially reject nuclear weapons.
Washington also protested against calling to cancel severe international sanctions regarding North Korea.
"United States of America initially insiste on "denuclearization" and increase the level of pressure using sanctions to achieve their goal in a forced way, and even protesting against "anunciation of the end of war"," said Ri.
"Determination of what sanctions can place us on the knees is a mar imminent of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the sanction continues to deepen our inconsistency.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kimam and Trump, which the president of the United States noted earlier this week in the United Nations Organization.
Instead of this, the minister noted three meetings between Kimm and the leader of South Korea Mun Jian in the past five months and added: "If the participants of this question about the denuclearization of the South Korean deputy were the Korean deputy deputy deputy was the Korean deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy USA."
However, tone of speech Ri Rezka differed from the last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly argued that the nazi of the United States continent using missiles of North Korea was inevitable after that, as the "Minister of the President of the evil" the "Minister of the President of the evil" name Trump
Annual in this year in UN Trump, who last year threatened "King to destroy" North Korea, honored Kim for his courage in taking measures devastating, but said it would be necessary to make a lot more, and sanctions must be ahead of the day. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The Security Council has strengthened sanctions in relation to North Korea in 2006, attempting to stop financing nuclear and political-misket programs of Beijing.
Pompeo met Ri in the Council of Security. General Assembly then notified that in the next month, he will visit Pyongyang again to prepare himself for the next summit.
Pompeya has visited North Korea already three times this year, but his last trip wasn't successful.
In July, he abandoned Pyongyang, declaring that progress, achieved with North Korea for several hours of talks, concluded with a declaration of visa, that he represents the requirement "after ahead of gangsters".

Harvard Students are going through the course of a correct break.
The New Course of Harvard University this year must train students to sleep more, and is designed to combat culture learning nights with coffee in hand.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to properly care for themselves and their health.
Charles Cheeseler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at a hospital named Brigma and a female hospital, developed a course, which, in his opinion, is the first in his birth in the United States.
Inspired by speech over the influence of lack of sleep on learning, he started the course.
At the end of the lesson, a girl came to me and said, "Why did you say this to me just now, in the last course of lesson?"
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - it surprised me," - said The Telegraph.
For the first time in this year, the course is taught by students, explain why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sport achievements, as well as improved mood common.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Service of the University, claimed that the University decided to conduct the course after the discovery that students are often invited to sleep.
The course that takes an hour includes a variety of interactive tasks.
One side is the appearance of a room in the internet, where the students presse on cups of coffee, fireplaces and books, which tell about the impact of the cafe and light and how the deficient sleep affects the sports indicators, as well as the importance of the usual before bed.
In amplitude fase, participants deklare how multiannual somnolence can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Mapa campus, with interactive images, invite participants to think about their daily life.
"We know that this will not change the attitude of students.
But we believe that they must know this as well as everyone know about the consequences of smoking for health,” he added.
According to his words, the culture of nightnights continues to exist, adds that modern technologies and constantly growing pressure on students leads to the fulfillment of sleep, which becomes increasingly a problem.
"Assured sleep of good quality must be a "arm secret" studentes to combate stress, elimination, and tremor," - he said, - even to avoid excess weight, because alignment of sleep makes the brain a constant head."
Raymond So, 19-year-old California student, who studies chemical and physical biologie, assisted Professor Cheeseler in the development of the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to watch everyone on campus.
Hopefully the next step will be the request for all assertives to complete analogue curriculum before graduating in the university.
Profesor Kaysler recommended the student's ability to install a clock to know when to go sleep and when to wake up, meditating on the negative consequences of "blue light", which radiates from screens monitors and LED lamps aspiring, which is the point, which can be changed to a change
"Lyngstan" 1:0 "Raiders": "Meg is beautiful by Jerry's goal."
"Raygers" sufrir another parasys, when Dolly Mango Gol convinced Stephen Gerard wouldn't receive parasys 1:0 in stadium "Livingston".
Ibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to the triumph with number 4-1 4-1 in February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holtan's team already brings the second parass of Gerard as a manager from 18 18 games in order to take the manager from 18 games to take the keys to get Labrower's Lad's of his side to the heart's Lad's of his side.
Menga hits in 7 minutes before the stop, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, didn't seem like to crash the parasy.
At the same time, as Rangers descends to sixth place, Livingstan took the third place, and the back remains the Hibernians with the differences in the balls.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after as Columbus Spence's forward should be treated by head trauma after as his type of item, kidnapped from the tribulation.
Gerard did eight players change, because Iro didn't play in the semifinal of the Battford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under 11 numbers, allowing me to take point from Hearts on the last week, and was admired de how they were good on each step passed their adversaires.
Rangers were more possessive of the ball, but Livigstan did more attempts to kill the ball.
They should have killed already after two minutes, when Menghi first guided the ball through Scott Pittmann to the doors of Alan McGreger, and then half defender used this chance.
The Successful Penalty of Jacobs Keegan interfered with the filming of Craig Halkett, but his partner for the defense of Alan Litgow تمكنa de bringing a powerful hit backwards.
Rangers greeted control, but in the last third of the games had more hoped to kill than demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Marelas, of course, should have been sanctioned for a quarter of an hour until the end, when he and Stephen Lawles met on the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the complaint of Columbia.
Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but former broker Abrox Liam Kelly knappt gave the goal of Lassano Kulibali and the effective attack of this Acharia.
Although you've killed the first goal in the 34th minute of Libya, perhaps, was against the further active game, but nobody refuses that they must demonstrate a good game to the prisoner.
"Renderers" was unable to test James's gate.
Scott Arfield was unresolved when Decklan Galhacher gave Scott Robinson's passport, who blocked Mengo's chance to kill in port.
JARARD substituted a Culibally stop to Ryan Kent, and this showed a effective effect when the attack came to Marellas, but the irritable Kelly escaped and blocked the attack.
But "Livingstan" continued to please the visitors, playing the game that they just liked, and Litgov and Halkett continued to share the ball after long opposition.
Bock Holt was able to overcome only in the last few minutes, but McGregar played well to oppose Jacobs before Lithgav went to a reservoir.
Reinforcer Glenn Middleton's replacement occurred in a row once after the penalty, when he met James, but Thomas managed to retreat.

Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which resulted in the manifestation of the device, known as Heiger's counter.
Heager's Numberer became part of science and appeared in pop culture, like in the 1950 film "The Queen of the Kingdom", in which they participated, it would seem, known scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who's he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Heager counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
"If you place your headphones, you really have a chance to hear sounds of atoms that are radioactive in minerals."
Evans: “Tell me, is this really pushing right now?”!
Hans Hayger died in 1945, a few days before 63th anniversary of his birthday.
But the inventions that bear its name continue to use.

Johnny English Strikes Again Review imposes a hit on invented spion of Rowen Atkinson.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British earlift, and this earlift seems to have been in comedy and ex-franchise Johnny Ingliss, which started yet in 2003 with Johnny Ingliss. "John Ingliss is awarded in 2011
Could salad well expressed about how obviously without meaning we look when talking about new export possibilities?
Ignorable Johnny Ingliss obtiene the opportunity to talk over the things - his name was more sound than all the comic creatures that he made for non-inglees watchers in the movies.
I'm known that he's a secret agent who, in spite of his wisegelistic preference to glamour, has become a little similar to Kluzo with the rice of Mr. Bine and a little like a guy who gave the only note in Hor Horn at the Fire in 2012 in the ceremony of the opening of the Lodith Olympics in the opening of the Olympics.
Initially, his character was based on the legends and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played in the Forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his path.
There are a few moments delicate that no exista before.
I liked Johnny Anglish, who is approaching the helicopter, helicopters in the middle age, and the rotator's holes a little screw over his shaft.
Dar Atkinson for theatre comedy is demonstrated by light, but humanity feels weak, and therefore awesomely when serious films, such as "Agent 007: Mission incomplete" surely propose comedy as a part of the main.
Humar feels like it's not just for adults, but also for children, and even the unforgettable accidents of Johnny Ingliss are not as inventive as the movable films of Atkinsson in a single Bine.
The ongoing conceptual multi-years are serious problems of the UK.
Cyber-hacker has pronounced in a super-secret community of British spys in Britain, discovering the names of all British agents in places, to deceiving the agent of the government – this is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last thing for the Prime Minister, which is a miserable and misleading acts, who already suffer from political inpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything possible with this Quase-Trezai-Mei, but in the scenario there is nothing like that.
She's advisors for the information report that since every real spy will be discovered, she'll need to act some of those who are already retired.
I mean that it means that Johnny Ingliss is the same thing is complicated: now it works as the sixth teacher in several complex institutes and gives lessons on how to be a unclear operator: some good examples here, because the English is the same John Ingliss is the same.
England returned to Whitehall for an extraordinary browsing and joined his ex-year-old friend Bo, who plays Ben Miller again.
But now, my marriage is bound to the commander of the submarine ship, the role of which Vicky Pepperdin has executed a little.
That's how Batman and Robin get badly wrong things in the secret agency of Queen, where they work again, meeting a beautiful woman Volga Kurilenka.
Inter alia, Prime Minister receives a dangerous order of a charismatic technical billionaire, which declares that it can solve problems with hackers of Britain: with a miserable Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.

All the moments have been pulled for the last event, but it's just like and sounding, which have a lot of children in TV.
Devil is good good material.
And what about other films about John England I couldn't think: couldn't British cinema industry give Roman Atkinsane a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Leipzig Party rejects the development of a plan for paying British for a four-day work week with paying for five days.

I'm noted that employees of the building are enjoying from the output of three days, but they'll be equally gained the same salaries.

ZEZ PROFESSIONS HAVE OPINION PER QUARTE DAY WITH A WITH A BUDGET OF THE ECONOMIC MANUFACTURATION.
The oldest source in the Labour Party reported to The Sunday Times: “The planned review of actions will be announced until the end of the year.
This isn't going to happen now, but the four-day workweek is a idea that matches the views of the party and the general industrial strategy of regulating economics for the benefit of workers.
The Lebarist Party is not the first to approve such a idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-day work week during the general election company in 2017.
However, the efforts of the Liberal Party in total are not supported.

US can use VMS for "blocking" to prevent export of Russian oil and gas
"Washington can, if necessary, contact the military-marine fleet to prevent outlet of Russian energy on the EU and Middle East markets," - said US secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner.
Zink affirmed that the actions of Russia in Syria, particularly where it acts on the invitation of the legitime government, constitute the basis for the study of new energy markets.
“I believe that their residence in Middle East is that they want to buy energy just as they want to buy in East Europe and South Europe,” he said.
And, dearly, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"United States have the possibility of using a marine fleet to ensure openness of marine fires, and, if it is necessary, to organize blockade, so that their energy must not fall into the market," he said.
Vinke refers to the participants of the event, organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-commercial group, which positiones itself as a "voice of Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He has compared the approaches of Washington to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same.
"Economic Alternative for Iran and Russia is equivalente and replaces fuel," he said, nominating Russia "Enazial Country" with a economy, dependent from the exhaustive fuels.
"These statements have emerged when Trump's administration wants to significantly increase exports of its gas gas gas gas gas to Europe, by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this, employees of Trump’s administration, including US President Donald Trump’s own, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the “impossible” project of gasoduct “North Flow 2”, which, according to Trump, transformed Berlin into “palone” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the gas pipeline "North Flow 2" costs 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively a project economic.

The placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice of promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington have deployed a trade war, resulting in the mutual imposing of tariffs on import.

The Ther Brensted, US ambassador in China, and former gouverneur of Job, principal exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Brenstade in the author article of Des Moines Register Sunday Edition, "nowadays doubled his efforts, printing propaganda propaganda in our free press."
"Assuming his promotion, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press, printing a publicitary paid in Des Moines Register, "Brensted wrote.

While many known Republicans defende the candidate for the position of Supreme Judge Bret Cavano in front of face of several accusations of sexual abuse, analytics have warned that they will receive a hit in response, especially from women, during future intervals outward.
Emotions around it were very powerful, and the majority of Republicans already show that they are ready to speak.
“Thite things can’t return again,” said Grant Richer, professor of sciences politics School of Maxwell of the Siracusa University of publishing “The Hill” for the article. which was printed on Saturday.
The Savior claimed that it was uncertain that the statements of Senator Jeff Fleck (Arizona) about the investigation from FBI would be enough to refresh the disrupted voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national secretary of the MoveOn Progressive Group, said
Friday morning, protestants scandalized "Liste of Fast!" during demonstration in Senate Hall, where Republicans, who control the committee of legal, decided to issue a candidature to Cavanato, in spite of the statement of Dr. Christian. Mi Blacse, Mi Ford Ford
"Entusiasme and motivation of democrats will be extraordinarily big," declare Stu Rottenberg, un independent political analyst.
“People say they’re already high, and that’s true.
"Everything can be even higher, especially among women-electors in the premies and young electors from 18 to 29 years old, who don't like president, but often don't vote."
Even before the opening statement of Ford, in which she detailly denounced the accusations of the candidate in the Supreme Court of Sexual abuse, analitiks estimate that if Republicans are going to insist on confirmations, they can place a strong strike response.
"For Republican Party, "esta's made some resident," said Michael Still, ex-chief of the National Committee of Republican Party at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
“The talk is not about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or about whether Cavanato is going on the post. The talk about how Republicans have done this and how they have done it to it,” noted by the news channel Gay Sessel. The speaker of the group,Group DG USAori.
However, it's like that the Americans split in the issue of Ford's or Cavanate's rights, which is a little bit higher than that of the last.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents are surely or not very surely trusted by Ford, and 35 per cent said that they are surely or not very surely trusted by Cavano.
In addition to this, 38 per cent said that, according to their expectations, Coffeen probably or probably heard in his statement, and 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
After a strike on the side of Fleck, FBI will investigate accusations on the side of Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week Ford made a statement under oath before the Legal Committee of the Senate, that Cavano, when he was drunk, claimed her at 17 years old.
Ramyrez argued that the candidate to the Supreme Court demonstrated her her genitals in the evening, when they studied in Eiles in 1980s.
Inventor of the World Network plans to start New Internet to make Competition Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world network, lanse a startup, which will be made to competitors Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The Last Project of Legend of Technology, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform of Bernard-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of data storage and who has the right to access this information.
In an exclusive interview Fast Company Berners-Lie, he claimed, creando Inrupt, that he had a thought of "consideration over the world".
"I am going to do this right now," he said about the startup.
“That’s a historic moment.”
The software uses Solid technology to allow people to create "own data storage on the Internet" or POD.
This can contain lists of contacts, lists of tests, calendar, fantasi and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available instantly on one browser simultaneously.
The uniqueness of a personal storage of data on-line is that only the user determines who has access to what kind of information.
Company calls this "personal boosting potentials with the help of data."
Determination of John Bruce's CEO's idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together resources, processes, and skills necessary to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The Company is now composed of Berners-Ley, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, several developers who work on the project under contract and co-workers-walkers.
Starting from this week, developers of technology around the world can create their own decentralized programs using tools available on Inrupt web site.

"Non, we're not trying to give them permission."
In a Saturday publication on the issue of Medium Berners-Lie, the mission of Inrupt "is the provision of commercial energy and ecosystems for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lie transformed the Internet, creating a Consortium of the World Network in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Ley has been very influential for the neutrality of the network.
Even by launching Inrupt, Berners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic configured after a new era of networking", adds Berners-Lee.

MMA Fans waited the whole night to watch Bellator 206, they received Pepa pig instead
Just imagine, you've stayed all night to see a packed transmission from Bellator 206, and then you're rejected in view of the main event.
The program of San Jose was 13 plays, including six on the main map, and they were shown in direct show all night on British TV Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gerar Moses and Rory McDonald's were ready to jump, watching Britain just ate when the program changed to Pepa's pork.
Some of them were deceived after they stayed silent night, waiting for this battle.
One of the players in Twitter called switching to a baby boy as "city unclear smile" (city unclear smile).
In response to the question of broadcasting Dave Swartz, senior vicepresident Bellator in marketing and communications questions said: “Desde la legislature state and 6 morning this content was inadequate and was necessary to switch to a child program.”
"Yes, "Svinka Pepa".
Bellator Scott Coker, President of the Company, said that in the future, they will work on the program to consider British viewers.
"Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We can do everything possible.
Assurance, if the programs were changed, we received very much messages, and they weren't all nice.
We tried to solve the problem, perceiving that this is a technical error.
But this is a state-of-the-art.
I'm sure I can promise that next time I'm not going to happen like that.
We'll lower the number of catches from six to five, as we do it normally, this time we'd like to order fans, but we'd grow old.

"Desk of an unclean island": Tom Dalee felt "unclean" because of sexuality
Tom Dalee's Olympian look at jumps in water said that he has grown with a sense of insignificantness for others because of his sexuality - but that's giving him motivation on the way to success.
Septuagint, 24-year-old athlete said, "I'm not all such as me, I'm not all such as me, I'm not all such as me, I'm not all such as I'm going to school."
Speaking in the program "Desk of the Insolence Island" Radio 4 in Leader Lawrence Lawrence, he said that supports the rights of gays to give another "hope".
He also said that when he was born a child, he began to think less about the victory at the Olympics.
Traditional leader of this pretty old program Kirsty Yang, took a break for several months because of the disease.
In the role of a man who appeared on the unbelievable island, on Lavern's first program, Daley said that when he was childhood, he felt "literally small" for all the others, because "the society didn't accept those that both boys and girls liked."
And he said, "And now I think that this feeling that you are not as all and as insignificant, was that he gave me strength and inspiration for success."
"He wanted to prove that he was a "kind", he said he wouldn't disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.

He said that he had expressed his expectation, because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The Three-time World Champion said that when he falls in love with a man – American script, director and prosecutor Dastine Lance Blake, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me”.
Daley is married to the owner of Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but, according to him, the difference in age doesn't matter.
"Siempre, si tu pases through such a young age", "si tu pases through such a young age", "si tu pases through the first Olympics at 14 years old," "si tu pases through three years after his father died of cancer," "si tu said it was difficult to find a balancer that would survive such a crop and underwear."
In June, they became parents, their son was born by Robert Ray Black Dale, and Dale said that his "perspectives totally" changed.
“Entonces, if you would ask me last year, I would tell you that I need to win gold medal,” he said.
"Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Robbie – is my gold medal Olympics.”
His son will also be called like his father – Robert. His father died in 2011, when he was 40 years old of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to London Olympic 2012 – he wanted to sit in the first series.
"I couldn't tell him," he said, "you wouldn't sit in the first line, papa," he said.
"I had held his hand, ''je said,'' if he stopped breathing,'', 'and just if he stopped breathing and died,'', 'I finally realized, 'He was not immortal,''.
In the following year Daley competited for the 2012 Olympics and won bronze medal.
"I just knew that just about this I've done it all my life – jumping in water before my ballots in the Olympic Games, it's the best feeling," he said.
This also influenced the choice of the song – Proud from Heiser Smol – which has found in them a comment in preparing for the Olympics and from which and now the mosquitoes run.
"Baby's Deadless Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 at British Summer Time.

If Americans who stand at the four keys of the beginning of 12 single matches, start with success, Michaelson match can seem extremely important.
Furrick expressed confidence in this game, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He has fully understood his role today, he has pleaded me, he has knelt down, he has said, 'Tomorrow's will be ready.
"He's very confident in himself.

"I'm constantly saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players from our side, but we very well understand that the best players in the world are on the side of the whole whole."
I am pleased with how his players played on a heavy field for golf, Burn adds: "I will never overvalue myself in this.

Launch of New German Military Ship Against Delayed
New Frigate of the German Navy must be built in 2014 in order to replace old military ships of times of the Cold War, but it will appear early in the next year because of false systems and cost constantly increasing.
Launch "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the absolute new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg fragentes, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citating a military representative.
Karabel should have entered the building in 2014, but the problems that emerged after construction impede this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class warships, ordered yet in 2007, must replace old Bremen class fregates.
They will be armed with powerful armatures, various anti-kabel and aerosol missiles, as well as some "steles" technologies, e.g., reduced visibility for radars, infrared and akustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics – longer periods between teaching service – more new fregates can't go into their partys to two years.
In addition, the European Union is the only one in which the European Union has been deployed by the European Union, and the European Union is the only one in which the European Union has been deployed by the European Union, the European Union, the European Union, and the European Union, the European Union, the European Union, the European Union, and the European Union.
Unfortunate F125 fragmat hits in headline last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take a boat and returned him Blohm & Voss verf in Hamburg.
The first time the Marine Marines returned the ship to a lift after the delivery.
The reason for returning is known is little, but the German media wrote about many "defects in software and hardware", which make the ship illusion in a combat mission.
The disadvantages of the software were particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have only 120 matroses – half crew of old Bremen class fregates.
Also apparent that the ship is very big, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further updates.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7000 tons, which double the weight of vessels of the same class used by Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the whole project – including the training of crew – also becomes a problem.
The price reached incredible 3,1 bilion euro (3,6 bilion euro) – initially 2,2 bilion euro.
Problems, accumulated with new freegames, become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the marine power of Germany is reducing.
Initially, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of Defence Committee in German parliament, assertioned that the Navy "has destot so fewer ships capables of military missions".
He said that the problem was overwhelmed, because the old ships were not written, but the ships were taken away from the sea.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregatten is incapable of joining the Marine.

New research, which will be carried out in the Scottish Mountains, is oriented to detect how they say they use landscape in hunting food.
The students hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying milk feeders and help in future actions in the conservation of these animals.
Scientific Research of the National Society of Monumental Security of Scotland is engaged in small statements and also burning long statements by Dabanton in the gardens of Innovation in Western Russia.
Special recording devices will be placed in the main locations of this site, to monitor the actions of the statements throughout the season.
Employees of the company and sponsors will conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
Answers of expert sounds of all records identifies the frequency of calls of speeches, as well as those said what they do.
Map of residence and report will be used to create a detailed picture of behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Djuar, Consultant of the National Society for Nature Conservation, hopes that the results will show which areas are the most important for stories and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the advantages of creating such places of residence, like luces, and how to support the glaciers for survival of rainbows and other animals associated with them.
The number of statements in Scotland and UK has declined considerably in the past century.
They threaten the construction and developmental work that affects the place of residence and destroys them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be dangerous, as well as liptic strips for mush and some chemicals for building materials. They are threatened and house cates.

But because of their nightlife, the ears said more rumor than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a complicated start-up technique to detect grooves and obstacles on the flight path.
The National Company, which accounts for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares land lands throughout the country, is very seriously addressed to the stories.
It works in ten specialists, who regularly conduct research, checks of residence and, sometimes, rescue events.
The organization is even created by the first and only testified by the Scottish witness of the speeches in the district of Troy in Damphrys and Gileady, where 8 of 10 species of the speeches in Scotland live.
The leader of David Thompson says that it's the perfect territory for the speakers.
"Triv, we've just got a great place to tell you," he said.
“We have old buildings, many old wooden and old wooden and very good place to stay.
"No, we don't know much about this, so our work here and in other areas helps more understand what they need for better life."
It stresses the importance of verification of the presence of the statements before carrying out the repair of the property, as you can endlessly destroy one seat, kidnapping up to 400 selfies and young statements, which will lead to the complete destruction of local population.
They are under protection and are prohibited to kill, defeat, refresh or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Feral, agent of the Organization of Defense Affairs in Scotland, invites the community to help in this matter.

The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be granted aid in restoration until Asad and the opposition will be reached a political agreement on the end of the war.
Deputates of the UN reported that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the recent major apostasy of Ideliyeb rebels created the possibility for the continuation of the political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a widespread attack of Syrian forces, supported by Russia in a province, where three million people live.
But Mualem insisted that the agreement had "accurate term" and expressed hope that the military action will be targeted against jihadists, including fighters from "Al-Qaida" linked with "Al-Qaida" front of Nusra, which will "be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Stafan de Mistura hopes in the near future to call the first sessions of the new committee, in which representants of government and opposition and governments are initiated to develop a reconciliated constitution for Syria and conduct the path to elections.
Mualem has expressed the conditions of the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, declaring that the work of the commission should be restricted to "observation of Articles of the Acting Constitution", and overview of the involvement.

External Cash Flows involved in a rigid pre-selective race of intermediary elections at the House of Representatives
I'm surprised that the 17th election of Pennsylvania circle closed a cash flow thanks to the change of limits of circles taken by Congress, which causes the two candidates participate in the elections for one place.
Recently depicted beautiful area of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conar Lamb, who won his place in another district in the elections of the past spring.
Lambu is opposed by another acting deputy, Republican Kit Ruthfus, who currently represents the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which coincide largely with the new 17th.
The Court of Pennsylvania in January decreed that the palaces of the old regions were non-institutionally counted for the benefit of Republicans.
The re-election race in a new 17th circle provoked a decline in the financing of the company by the groups of financial of the main parties, the Committee of Congress of the Democratic Company (KCDK) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (KRK).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after the complicated victory at a wide celebrated elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place was occuped by a Republican for over 10 years, and President Donald Trump won in a circle with a disruption in 20 points.

“I thought that we could have what he wanted – limited in time and in the area of investigation – we could get a little conjunction,” he said on Saturday Mr. Fleck, adding that he wouldn’t worry him that committee “developed” because he really tried.
Why Mr. Cavano and his Republican fans wouldn't want the FBI to conduct investigation?
They are not able to understand what they say sometimes.

Saul claims that more than 30 000 residents of North Korea have illegally crossed border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Majority runs through China, with which North Korea is the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Delimitated Zone (DMZ) between two Koreans, which is very strongly protected.
China regarde refugees as illegal immigrants, rather than as refugees and often forced them to repatriate.

This took place after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Cheng In in June in Singapore, when they agreed in general working with the aim of full liberation from the nuclear army of Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Rya Yun Ho accused the US sanctions in the absence of progress since then.

Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune edition festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman would behave like this, she would be called 'esterical'," said Pelozi about his reacción to Cavano's speech before the Juridical Committee of Senate Thursday.
Kavano is an emotional abrogation of accusations in sexual claims to Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, when they were still teenagers.
During his initial speech Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even cried and couldn't speak when discussed his family and senior school classes.
He also explicitly accused democrats in the committee, calling the accusation against his "gratis and organised homicides of a person", organised by liberals, who have devastated because of the fact that Hillary Clinton has played the president of the year 2016.

"I think he himself disqualificated with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelozi questioned if she asked if she would try a Cavanate impotence, when it was chosen, and when the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say so - if he doesn't say the truth in Congress or FBI, then he doesn't just have to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works right now," Plozi said.

In the auditions of confirmation at the post Cavano no responded to questions, whether it will annulle certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for the stereo, objective individuals to work in court and wait from us words "how wonderful this is,"," said Pelozy.
A woman must understand this.
This is a true accusation, months and years of anger just moves, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We weep when we're angry," 45 years ago Mr. Stanley me dijo.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"I'm very helpful for a woman who worked with a director, and who said that when she was hungry, she was crying, but she worked with the technique of behavior. When she was hungry and she started crying, she was crying, she was crying, she was crying, she was crying, she was crying, she was crying, she was crying.
But I'm angry."
And I just kept talking.
I think that’s great.”
And the lips of thee are given to thee, because they have seen the conscience of thee.
One of my brightest memories from the first work on which once I was crying from an insignificant evil, then I was screamed for a consortium for a lady of a lady – a lady of a lady who always lost me a little bit – and pulled me up to a walk.
"Never let's see you in the dark," she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad, and they will rejoice that they have given you."
Patricia Šrodar, a tempo de Congressman-Democraat from state of Kalarad, worked from House Hartm in the presidency of the company.
In 1987, when Mr Hunt was asked for a wedding relief on a yacht called Monkey Business and went out of a president race, a very excited Mr Sroder said that she and herself could participate in a president company company.
"Non, this was a very good idea solution," she laughed, she said 30 years later.
"Yahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Some people called this situation "Black snow and seven gnoms."
Since the company has gone for a long time, she hasn't had funds, so she said that she won't participate in elections if she doesn't win $2 million.
This was a lost situation.
It was evident that some of her fans, who sacrificed 1000 $ men, gave her only 250 $.
"Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
if she spoke with a statement that she will not participate in the election company, she's so strongly agitated emotions – thanks to people who supported her, anger on the system that so complicated to gain money and loss to the voters. the anger in the anger, and not the rage on the sides
"You might think that I'm nervous," remembered Mr. Shroder reacción de la presse on her condition.

Why Trade War between China and USA can be good for Beijing
The first waves of trade war between China and the United States were agregate, and since war is far from the end, in the proximity of the distortion between countries may be in favor of Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump has shot the first warning at the beginning of this year, covering taxes of China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium, China's solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation occurred this week, when the new tariffs closed goods to a total of $ 200 billion (150 billion pounds), in fact covering half tax of goods that arrive in the USA from China.
Beijing has responded this way each time, with a recent increase of tariffs from 5 to 10 percent per US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised a simetric response to the United States, and the second is the largest economy of the narrative or the eye.
In order to force Washington to retreat, you need to deepen the need, but public opinion before the United States is virtually non-required for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that when Beijing correctly uses the situation, pressure of the US trade war in a remote perspective could support China by reducing mutual dependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a quick political solution in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start the process of a short economic downturn, is much more dangerous than the observers estimated by the New York Times," said Eagle Grays.
