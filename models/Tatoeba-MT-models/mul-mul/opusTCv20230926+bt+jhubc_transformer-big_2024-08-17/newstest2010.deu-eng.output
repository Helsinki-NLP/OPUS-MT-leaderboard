Barack Obama receives the fourth U.S. President of the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive here as the fourth U.S. President in history the Nobel Peace Prize.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify the global diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
The boss of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the north-western metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He first visited the Nobel Institute, where he first met with the five committee members elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its high point with the ceremony, where Obama takes over the Prestige Prize.
He receives this as the fourth U.S. President, but only as the third who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when the prize is taken.
The President does not want to deviate from this issue because he knows that he takes the prize as a president who currently leads war in two countries.
A few days ago, he has strengthened the war efforts by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which no one of his critics forgets.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the goal medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided about a concrete caritative work.
The event program then provides a banket with the President and his wife, where the king and queen will also be present outside of Norway, as well as the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests.
Obama has been very restrained with the price from the beginning.
For example, he suggested that he feels that he doesn’t deserve the prize.
He also repeated that the price was not only for him, but for everyone who seeks the same values as he seeks.
Immediately after the announcement, he concluded that this is for him "a call for action."
Nature protector is accused of oppression
The Leitmeritz Police accused the President of the Citizen Association "Natural Protection Community Leitmeritz" of repression.
In several cases, he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals, he requested money from investors in his favour, said the police spokesman Alena Romova.
President of the Leitmeritz-Natural Protection Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and it threatens him to be punished for up to three years.
The sorting mill containers in Brünn do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packages, and in the southern towns you can find the sorting mill containers in step-by-step.
And in Brünn?
There you need to book a few minutes to find the appropriate tones of waste.
I do not want to claim that the separation of waste in Brno would not work at all.
But I think it's not enough to take care of this problem, even if we're the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste race in the Urwaldliga, not only because we, as a citizen, are always allowed to send paper, glass and plastic to the sort containers, but especially through the number of waste tons for such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to remove PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is art, before all, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the ground ground against the affected Gans.
Mr. Underka should not be angry with our colleagues, but this is too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is not a honey slaughter in other parts, too.
The whole series of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
From fault.
They are too far from the tones of waste.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street I haven't seen any colorful tones in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place while driving the train.
But the waste was almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to cool the brewers socialists.
You prefer to buy a city’s eishockey league that makes us shame in the whole republic rather than buying a few tons of waste more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I’m glad I could also confirm my adoption with official statistics after I’ve been searching for a while on the internet.
According to the company data EKO-KOM, Brünn is really the worst in the district of South Mauritius.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and hospital funds
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, hospital funds and building savings.
But not for the debt interests or for the international court dispute.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in the government in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have implemented the salary increase for some groups, they estimated that the government would provide the money for sensitive expenditure, pensions or hospitality. "This is just a boost of problems in the future, mining," Janota says.
Of course, the loans are increasingly paid higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some time.
Too much to choose from where to take, the state cash is empty.
If the social services or costs for the public business are not reduced, the tax is increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the firefighter, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
In order to retire or the hospital money from which the account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don’t have to be afraid to get that money.
But for the price that the state debts itself even more – next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state cash, but much more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will rise faster and, together with this, also costs and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to shorten the maternity money, as the government did in its regional deficit package.
Due to the reduction in money in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing for the development of highways and railroads next year.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly poisoned.
Get what isn’t free.
This means delay or suspension of thirty large buildings, also threatened the European money creation, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, warns.
The CSSD has suggested that it solves the flow of money harmoniously - it captures the CEZ shareholders in which the state is the owner of the majority, and then expenditure of the money into the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is not in any way an infinite source.
In the past year, 18 billion CEZs have moved into the budget.
Each year, the dividend pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled, and this money serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, the carnival of the conversions is not yet ending.
Almost three billion lowered the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for the court dispute, even for building savings.
Whether the state will reach out without that money is uncertain.
It's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money inside or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already launched two-billion project "State Cash", which will allow you to monitor on-line, for which individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project should be stopped and sanctions come in this case, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect the future with a mobile phone, where the user can switch by pressing a single button between different operating systems.
The plans presented look promising.
Just press one button, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is the option that the American company wants to present VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile.
You can switch between these, you can divide them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, reported Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware at the interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has successfully introduced the journalist the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously runs the above Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full.
VMware is now working with European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and will come to the customer by 2012.
Snowmangel on the mountains calls the hotel owners
Sceneless piste concerns not only the residents of the gigantic birds.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering skiing in hotels and guesthouses.
This is why you can still get free rooms in Riesengege for all winter dates including Christmas and Silvester.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we believe this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Anyone who wants the Silvester auction stay in the spindle mould just according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers savings and where the quality of stay only comes to second place, he can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer only weekly stays for the Silvester Day.
I think they'll try to sell them for a while, but then they'll also have to spend them on, and in shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly shine, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds at all winter semesters always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
We are mostly interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, said.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the Silvester Day in Riesengege, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Riesengebergs.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the piste is snowed within a week, Christmas will also be out sold, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, we managed to occupy the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about 5% better than last year.
On Silvester Day and Christmas we only have a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in the Poland holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80% for the Silvester stay, Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas at the last hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were surprised this year in January, for which we are currently occupied by about 60 percent.
A slightly weaker is now between February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giesengeberg will certainly also increase, said Hotel Director Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel owners are now waiting for greater snow protection.
On Thursday it should cool and if it comes to rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But afterwards heating will come again, Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove informed.
U.S.: Repeat is Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost strange with what students chasing with Barack Obama, the president, with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghanistan question he considered himself the most foolish.
Finally, when he broke out his expecting Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it over the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that he used the word “as in Iraq” several times in the text himself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: “New Path” without telling.
Three years ago, he criticized the Bush ideas - fresh military quotas - to send Iraq to the civil war - as "unresponsible and in its consequences karastrophic decision".
The next few months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on military recommendations was the only possible and in this way very successful that the news about Iraq was no longer spoken at all today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
In order to increase the military quota, the military asked him again, particularly the chief commander of Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even criticized the striking shields in the White House despite the customs of subordination.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to turn the situation to better.
The president complained for three months, but did not come to a better idea, so he deceived the general's petition by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he initially estimated at least 10,000.
The most problematic in the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some have doubts that the half-enlargement will have the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Even despite the Brotherhood of the last few years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders respect the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - on Niemanden you can rely and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they were formally established correctly, remain only shadow buildings behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The equation of interest between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially due to the intransparency of the circumstances that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "activist state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy is addressed by his volunteerism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now at the edge of the explosion.
They believe that the small soldiers who have been shouting in the war about the early returns can create a miracle here only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of the troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take it as an indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is a tendency.
Europe’s politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how Germany’s or Italy’s security is related to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions on Iranians do not affect, the United States is a very serious question whether the problem is not solved by troops.
This question must be answered during the period when the United States is heading to Obama for the withdrawal of victory from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
Barack Obama’s only consolation blast is the fact that he remains three years until the presidential election, and thus remains enough time to reach another strategy if it proves to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonuses in bar
The heads of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive any bonuses in bar this year.
This has been announced by the company that responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of money, but they can only sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to Reuters, stands at the top of the efforts to connect the Wall Street premiums with long-term performance.
I believe the Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which it has to go, the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target target of the criticism, after putting nearly 17 billion dollars on premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total increase in premiums over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure shown today.
The high premiums in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue with the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge bankers’ bonuses exceeding £25,000 once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also prepared by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record wives today in Stockholm have received the Nobel Prize this year from the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with her landlord Jack Szostak for research in the chromoson area.
The Israeli Ada Jonath Award for Chemistry, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the prize for clarification of the ribosom structure and function.
The latter awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her Landsman Oliver Williamson have received for analysis of the economic report.
The only professional category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was Physics.
Today, researchers Charles Kao, along with Willard Boyl, have taken this award for the research in the glass fiber area, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical remote pipes.
Each of these award-winning winner has the diploma, received the Nobel Prize Medal and a certificate of the acquisition of the money award.
In each category, it has ten million Swedish crowns.
If there are several prizes in each category, the prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, U.S. President Barak Obama has received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he has recognized the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and he is at the top of the country, which leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for achieving world peace, even if the price is high for it.
Minister Janota considers resignation, Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who considers his stay in the government early on Friday because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was informed by the President’s spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now receives the clause to be signed, the Czech Republic should handle a deficit of 163 billion Krones.
However, the Parliament voted on Wednesday on the proposals of the left party for money laundering and increased money for the officials, for the maintenance of social services and for the direct wages of the farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it covers the increase of budget deficit.
Between the left side and the government, Klaus and the right side, there is a sharp internal political dispute, therefore the questionnaire on the further work of the fishermen’s official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of savings implemented by the fishermen government in autumn, which, after their understanding, is intended to end the government debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, said today at the breakfast of discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have forgotten for a longer time the "stressful problem" which represents the "inseparable deficit" of public finances.
He believes that there is no good solution now.
Improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on an even broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS Chairman, Mirek Topolanek, argued that the budget was grey, and the government should consider its further existence.
ODS chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the office cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editing as "strong statements".
CSSD chief Jiri Paroubek responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was grey that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion krones.
As of Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claimed that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Beautiful" shows a lot of the world from its struggle and victory despite some critics that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, racial relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The untired fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as his first black president, Nelson Mandela, represented in his life history of American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked for the ninety-nine-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I said to him, "If I'm going to play you, I'll have to meet you.
The twenty-seven-year-old actress who had received the award for his role in Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby" already represented the leader of the movement to abolition of slavery, from which he has finally become a slave holder, a fictional U.S. president, who is, and also, God in "Evan Almighty", but is just as rarely important to many who still live.
The former South African Stateman had been in prison for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "beat" and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film paints a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the South African Rugbyte team captain Francois Pienaar to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racial and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can agree with his people through the sport, so he decides to agree with the rugby players who belong to the outsiders around the world.
Finally, the South African team is rising to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the Kinole Wall.
He had no other goal but to play this role in order to close it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politicians were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him in the evening and be behind the cults before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shot your hand, I take your energy, she will be transferred, and I had the feeling I know what you feel, he said.
It is important for me to be a different person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I climbed to the turkklingel that he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: ‘I look much bigger in the movie’.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unchacked" and also talks about prospects for an Oscar.
Todd McCarthy, the film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, shared his evaluation in the following words: “It was a very good story, a very well-executed film.”
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com websites, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light secrets over Norway: Russians tested a missile
Over Norway was observed a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defense has not yet announced yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile has been tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start wasn’t successful again and the missile called the type “Bulava”, which originally should be the pride of the Russian Army, will become slowly the alptraum of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on-site at the missile tests had no positive effect on the success of testing.
Bulava is usually not initiated or damaged in the air at all.
In Russian newspapers, you already write about "Bulava" as a "rocket that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly but lights
This 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight were technical damage to the missile.
Probably the engine exploded at the third level of rocket.
This time, "Bulava" started from the atomic U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which ran under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the removal from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that it was actually the damaged "Bulava" that was caused by a mysterious light over the northern paths by an uncertain flying object.
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first time that it was a Russian missile.
However, this time, the generality has defended itself and argued that you cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fall out and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged at the first stage.
Although no test launch was made without error, only six out of thirteen of the Defence Ministry’s leadership is failed.
The nearly fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the Bulava will fly once without problems and will carry up to ten hypersonic atomic heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at age 51
The legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov appears at 51 years of age in a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and the Stanley Cup owner, will help his team CSKA Moscow in emergency, and will probably take place in the KHL on Friday dual against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career for forty years in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club by Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is unclear whether the comeback of the famous eishockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morality of other players, co-player Nemcinov said.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional eishockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormman Gordie Howe, a fifty-year-old, played a whole season for Hartford and was able to benefit from 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful eishockey players in history.
In the Dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, and also won the Canadian Cup as well as the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he doubled the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Eishockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave the trade unions. All overhours are cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overhours.
Due to frequently arranged overhours, the trade unions announced the strike willingness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the automotive factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the executives want to agree with the trade unions about a layer of Saturday this week.
We should not give up our production plan, which is a principle, and therefore, on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overhours were proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on Saturday.
This will be received by employees in the layer of Saturday of November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overhours.
Or they can pay the overhour pay or they can take replacement vacation on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek added.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday layer will be paid for travel and lunch.
Given that the overhours were the most urgent and burning point in terms of the claims and complaints of the trade unions that had suspended production last week, the management decided with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overhours for the month of December yesterday afternoon.
The employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eighth class for two more hours.
After signing the agreement, the strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions will be held on Friday afternoon.
Trade Union leader Petr Kuchar said on Wednesday that if they could agree to fulfill the requirements and sign a joint document, they would be ready to cancel the strike.
The situation in the automotive factory last week, on Wednesday, has declined as approximately 400 employees were spontaneously struggling due to constant overhours.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged scams.
The management, however, argued that employees had to make the overhours to meet the car supply needs.
The trade unions also demanded that employees who had interrupted production on Wednesday would not be imposed with any sanctions in their Monday’s trial.
In the area of overhours, trade unions require to reduce overhours work to a minimum.
In addition, they are required to pay the fee of 5,000 krones this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai currently employs 2,000 people.
Serial production was launched in the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds to stop spreading HIV viruses into the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact overrides the disadvantage that the connection to usual virus variants does not act as strongly as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
However, the patient can extend life and prevent the reproduction of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the viral reproduction has also the development of so-called resistant viruses, resulting from which no drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical-Technical High School) and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
They have proved that the substances known as metalocarborane act on the protein that is responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbonates are compounds of bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus reproduction in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists have reached new ‘improved’ compounds that have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular arms mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metal carbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-layer chickens that consist of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled with a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homemade and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus split caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious virus particles.
If we disable HIV protease, we also disable the proliferation of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe the entire series of compounds in which two pairs of chickens (see table) are coupled with a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed further.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reaction glass, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variants is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical formations, makes metalocarbons interesting compounds for further development of effective HIV medicines, says Pavlina Rezacova, Director of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Science.
ODS went to fishermen, who turns back
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, overcome its further existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
There is allegedly time for the analysis.
Petr Necas, Deputy Chairman of the ODS, said that the concept of the office cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is going to remain in office using the parliamentary links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the issue of public deficit is diametral, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however, with amendments from the left side over 12 billion Krones.
Parliament has increased the money for officials, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
In this regard, the government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it covers the increase of budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should save 163 billion dollars with a remaining amount.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has complied with the desire of the government, as the amended budget is also a less poor variant of the budget provisional.
Disillusionment and meaninglessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of meaninglessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has pointed out that the government still judges the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened the case with his resignation, the amendments would be accepted, the situation would seem different.
According to the Czech television, Janota entered the Premier for Monday after the government business.
He pointed out that he considered his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the lovingness of the budget.
As fisherman expresses himself for the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominations of Social Democracy (CSSD), who had made the budget changes, had nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to health and pensions or the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not mistake
This is the case of Prime Minister Fisher and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the United States.
It has noted that in some ministries, people sitting in a deputy function admitting to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fisherman decides to give up the fight against the deficit of public finances, "it is completely logical and correct that he relys on the left majority that is currently in Parliament."
He is claimed to be unable to expect the support and tolerance of the citizens.
I haven't thought about it, and if it's going to be up to date, I'm going to deal with it," said the Minister of Defense Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon to the European Council meeting in Brussels.
The ODS returns to the Prime Minister’s request
At the same time, Necas emphasized that the ODS would likely vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the members of the Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not imagine as a fool, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS was retreated in the political negotiation on the budget due to the absence of the party sitting in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t notice that my voice would be missing.
Since I resigned from the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mostly positive for Bolshevik and destruction of Parliament, Topolanek responded himself.
According to the new CD schedule, less trains will be driven for approximately the same fare.
The Czech railway ends or limits some less loaded speed and local trains, other connections are reinforced on the other hand.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2 percent from the date of validity of the new schedule compared to today.
Most rates incl. basic and customer travel rates are not changed.
Several connections to the capital get, for example, the residents of the Ostrava area, which the railroad uses for this route trains of the type Pendolino.
The train is no longer going to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less buses will also be driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, basically the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction plans the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (Kingsgraz), in total, by eight percent, can be delighted by an increase in Prague and its surroundings.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days of the week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to move.
It is the fifteenth road of the municipal transport system of Esko, which is possible to open through rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance routes to the capital will end at the Prague Main Train Station.
The CD leads more SC Pendolino connection lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will be driven within two hours of time.
With the Pendolino, passengers are no longer allowed to travel to Bratislava since December 13th.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million increases
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the railway to compensate the so-called liquidity loss will receive four billion kroons in the next year, just as this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total, will pay eight billion kroons in the next year, with the state to three billion kroons.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains and fast trains, the railway has recently concluded a ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railroad is praised by the system, and maybe it has also not hit the price rise in the vast majority of tickets.
Changes are only available for one-day CD Net and eLiska for cheap internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer ticket, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 Krones to 600 Krones.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the driven stack, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 krones.
Philippine Millitants have found more than 50 people who have been released.
Millitants kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP, which initially informed only about 65 executives.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
It was deported in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 million people were claimed to use the prisoners as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the rest of the prisoners.
According to the AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the weapon fraction of the Philippine Communist Party (CPP).
According to AP, the police pursued the kidnappers for violence demanding revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, Maguindanao province, the state law was imposed due to the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which was associated with the election to the governor’s neutrality, were 30 journalists.
Due to suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatoan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatoan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
However, on Tuesday, the peace negotiations with the Philippine government were resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will come to the American cinema "Invictus: the Invictus", which includes part of the life history of the former President of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against the apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who was claimed to have been elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The legendary South African Champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the film’s launch, the reactions of critics and the public will also be heard.
Nelson Mandela
He is named after Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, and in 1993 he and the Klerk received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because he comes to the cinema at a time in which, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup culminate in South Africa, while at the same time, the media are sharing the world with scary news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black dominant majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are firstly positive, despite numerous reserves against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times personally so that, as we say, I could receive his energy, he took up in an interview after the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to excite Mandela's personality and his message with this movie.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book draft of British writer John Carlin, freely translated in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portrays the South African human rights defender within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and day-to-day groups, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in his role in the South African National Rugbydress at the World Cup, which he won at that time in South Africa.
For the entry of races in the dress, which is considered almost as a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovulations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience, and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may end to joining people in a single nation, led the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only blackman in the national team in 1995.
Whether the stressed situation in South Africa is improving, it will only be shown.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, such as in a recent interview with the LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
Transformers burn in the Louny area for more than 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformator of the company Ceps in the switching plant at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
The fire attacked six units, according to the spokesman of the district firearm Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan.
Originally, the firefighter wanted to let the transformers burn, but later it changed its views and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water - foam and special debris.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer inner course lock.
No one was injured, the accident was not threatened, according to the company spokesman Pavla Mandatova, to the safety operation of the management system.
The damage has been estimated to be a number of 10 million krones, and more accurately the damage will be reduced only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new, according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened in the company Ceps, mistakes are rare, he added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokesperson of the CEZ for North Boehmen, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the trafostation was not affected by the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech area as a single operator of the control system, with electrical ducts of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switching units with 67 transformers, with which electrical energy is transmitted into distribution system and conductive lines with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises punishment for prosecution against three leaders of the CSSD.
Owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for abuse against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the Southern District, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice District and the head of the Olomouc District, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute Inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is associated with the company’s efforts to carry out regional railways in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the roses, while we have provided the offer only about the extent to which it was matched with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway that were completed last week.
So nothing else remains to us but to turn away from us.
Due to this reproach from the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he suggested that he had evidence from all directions that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the punishment ad for the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertising for his society as well as his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name as well as the good reputation of my district, and for this I also call on other leaders.
I assume that it will also be clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the area of regional railway traffic and uses false and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising that will point out the disadvantage of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after New Year.
He said he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has launched Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail traffic with the Czech Railway and have not made tenders for the order of about 150 billion kroons.
According to Vancura, such behavior is illegal and is contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of rail traffic in the banks, he threatened, according to Jancura, as well as a deputy of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a deputy of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus for free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcus changes the habit from January.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But now votes report that the obligation vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The Medical Institute already determines the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance needs to pay.
Experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August-Children
Children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcus born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that you have not received a vaccine dose yet.
Those who have already started with the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay further recurring vaccination themselves.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the child's 3rd and 5th month of life.
Last year, a quarter of the families had vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Parents paid $1,600 and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the younger children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance for vaccine doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 kroons a year.
However, they save the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has spent about 500,000 children’s area vaccinations annually.
The mandatory vaccine was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus cause median inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
With pneumococcus infections, we die in hospitals each year by studying up to 28 children aged up to 10 years of age.
Outside the Czech Republic, the obligation to vaccinate children against pneumococcus was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be required?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be obligation in the future.
From January, the insurance will be paid and will be voluntary.
For example, that the obligation to be better vaccinated, Rudolf Kalovsky, chief of the Nahlas Citizen Association, mentioned.
Its association is already working for the pneumococcus vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference where our association was involved were not very satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to do at least that.
I think this is the way we have to go now, led Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccine against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not consider it at all,” said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claimed.
Hana Cabrnochova, the chairman of the company of practical pediatricians, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then you could think about reducing the number of repeated vaccinations, “In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was launched as a voluntary,” Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their babies against pneumococcus from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is also crucial in that it is paid as the first surface vaccination by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurances should spend money on prevention so that they save for further treatment, badly Cabrnochova.
Doctors need to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, there is a concern about the practical pediatrician concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then the doctors receive them on the same path as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some Members feared that the insurance could "explore the money from the health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 krones a month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son participates in "Museum stealing steel"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was captured in his vehicle with followers when he invited 90 paintings.
It means that Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a bagger to penetrate the museum into the Pocono area.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of designs such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP cited a police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family party.
The agency reported, according to a police official statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was charged by his father that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a warehouse.
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta is accusing Senior of having granted permission.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, economics and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have left an opportunity to "disambiguate" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by taking the decisions out until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor also agreed that he targeted workers with low and medium-sized income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social insurance and a 1% coverage limit of public wage budgets for 2011.
Social Insurance Charger
The trade unions, however, have protested that low-blown recipients are punished for a recession that they have not caused and warn against upcoming "problems".
The rise in social insurance - at about £3 billion a year - has irritated the private economy, saying that this is a job tax, although the attention should be paid to economic rise.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
SECTIONS OF THE VORAB State Report
An additional 0.5% increase in social insurance from April 2011
This year, the economy declined by more than the expected 4.75 %
New 50% savings on banking bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Control deficiencies for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5 %
According to the estimate, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £90 per year, while a person with £100,000 annual income will be richer by £110 per year.
The ministers said their goal of semi-deficiency by 2013 would mean "tough decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be lost to 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
“That’s big numbers, they’ll bring us the deficit half-life, and that’s also essential for the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions about the future economic growth – affecting the extent of the debt repayment and the speed of the deficit repayment – were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will likely shrink by 4.75 percent this year - much more than the drop of 3.5 percent, which was predicted in April - while the debt would be £3 billion higher than previously anticipated.
"Forgotten opportunity"
The Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn from Labour’s “debt crisis” said the planned debt of £789 billion would be inestimable over the next six years.
They added that the ministers have missed to submit a credible plan on how they will repay this and push themselves "zynically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They haven't said anything about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they left them out."
“The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police be preserved from future cuts, unlike the proposals of the conservatives, which will see deficit capturing faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore arguing that the plans are “built on sand”.
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said some at the time of announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some disabled persons in April - would put the treasury Chancellor to the vote, as the money could just be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers have not announced any state details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public expenditure will only be carried out in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Surveys said the numbers of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong abductions in many areas, possibly in the future also in transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It moves the pain only later," said Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," said Roger Bootle, economic advisor at the financial audit company Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-state report. Markets recognize it."
FBI investigates "U.S. citizens' murders in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five U.S. citizens reported for suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, the US embassy in Pakistan reported.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the same men were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them must be Pakistani, one is Egyptian and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the accusations they are being accused and under what circumstances they are being arrested,” said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of the students.
He said the local police had previously been interested in the house, and no charges against the detained men have been filed yet.
The Reuters news agency reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. had to work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.
The five students were reported missing by your families in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns "miss practices" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details the patterns of abuse by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man who was quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has backed its previous criticism of human rights balance.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the controversial election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens of people were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now located in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closing of the Kahrizak penalty station.
But since then, there has been no longer any tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.
"Fake Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protest against the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he said.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty told him.
The defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in jail in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape claims, but admitted that abuse had occurred.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said he had been arrested in a container in a criminal facility in Kahrizak with 75 others over eight weeks.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the courts had established a committee that should investigate the disturbances after the election and government's reactions, but that would be unclear the amnesty, the mandate and power of these bodies and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a symbol in Bristol into a race point.
The ski piste of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
At the top of the hanging in the Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100-meter long hanging.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hang, but it was also very scary.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine underneath.
He added: "There are some of the country's best skiers and snowboarders here - some of the right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best pieces of art performed on the hang - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss voters voted for a construction ban for minaret and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe has been widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a funded and well-meaning report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why do the French don't like headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely arguing study of a disputed question that has shared and occupied the country for over a decade, and their effects are still true today.
Bowens’ newest book offers a more comprehensive and coherent spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really is happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Free Spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives discussions between teachers and students again about the questions that most concern them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a family house (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permitted for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
They are apparently profane matters, he claims to make everyday life unlike the political dramas that the media occupy.
The author recognizes a new generation of Imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, one of the Arab-Muslim teachers and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, to be a good Muslim and, on the other, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don’t have all arguments on your side.
Conservatives are misrepresented by the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen surveyed are mostly unlike their salafi counterparts – defenders of the Puristic Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – showing today a small, but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He asks how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so passionately protects the separation of the Church and the State) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harder treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to do their historical compromise with Secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a "degradation of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Is Islam French? After reading this book, you tend to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most comforting view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, maritime and fisheries interests have moved into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their glass water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the ice bear.
Walking in the complicated history and politics of the wavelength, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proven themselves to hunt on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old lake rider who only fought with the gunshot of his muskets is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught when they swim behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circuses.
A circle presentation at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an idea.
Even today, zoo plants still typically own a millionth set of living areas of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore has become quite green by the algues that grow in the smooth hairs of its peel.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that the hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although it is forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, construction continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and engine-slitted Inuits use powerful storm guns to bring their waves to the path.
Ironically, the ice will remain in the waters in the north of these two nations for the longest time.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the Arctic science and an insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneer trips at the end of the 19th and early 20th century led to the confusion of the package for the first time.
Underwater boats measure in the Cold War the moving grates while driving.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale excavation of icebergs on icebergs, but still a lot is achieved by un dried people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson looks at the strange, small world of the flow system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater insoles that are pressed together when frozen.
But, starting from the bear on ice to the microscopic little miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when summer ice is past, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months...that could be we.”
Marines were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Krones
De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine fans who took the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peace Cemetery in Arlington to decorate tombs, the day was a tribe to the men and women in their footsteps.
In a few months, no matter where we are going back from, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put crowns on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, as he and some others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take this trip every year, attend in different cities along the way to perform events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (cross across America), which also extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs at the Arlington Friedhof, in areas of the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Peace Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memorial site for the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated for the second time more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had taken her trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back to the victims.
She said this is a small contribution to how civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the extended grass surfaces and hills of the Friedhof.
Volunteers had older graves from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War as they are not frequently visited as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was delighted, children played, and couples held their hands while wearing the fresh cheese branches into the gray-being tombs.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red shaft attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where veterans of war are mostly buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals were crying openly, others prayed, and families and friends stayed in the ice air.
Some read the names in stone, while others climbed down to small black-white spot maps, which were stitched into the wet slam, whose tombs have not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who threw bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She was 8 hours driven from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the graveyard of Marine Infrastructure Subofficial David Shane Spicer who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free, my son has paid for it, she said.
“If I haven’t been for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government, selling mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, representatives of the Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
The contractor who has not yet been identified is working for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the U.S. Office for International Development and for the World Bank.
Consulate officials of the U.S. Representative of Interests in Havana try to get access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the accusation of "the danger".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, bear a risk of arrest.
Government hostile graphics and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will likely increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro Brotherhood in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy highlights that the United States will give a repayment when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average income of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government only allows normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are generally used to send text messages as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and to some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in must often report their names to the government.
Access is limited to many websites.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are sitting for crimes such as drug trafficking behind gitters, Gloria Berbena, a press spokeswoman of the U.S. interest representative in Havana, said.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the U.S. section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently issued a harsh report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", claims to the former brother's office of his brother Raul.
Vivanco said the accused would be arrested, convicted and incarcerated within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time both countries are moving for more dialogue willingness.
Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hoped that the case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist attackers seeking the Internet for young men radicalized.
Investigators said they had searched for an untransparent rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had invented them because one of them had made comments on terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
After her arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the remote territory in the Pakistani tribe court which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistani secret service, informed about the matter, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the leaders of Al-Qaeda that men are not part of a CIA oath for the immigration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were arrested for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the unrealistic mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were not disappointed in any way and continued to try to get the correct recommendations to get access to the Al-Qaida warehouses when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - highlights the key role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of urgency to submit human assets within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization are acting as guards who do not allow those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American volunteer recruits are subject to a special examination by A Kaida, analysts said.
Due to their potential access to U.S. goals and their promotional value, they are also regarded as incredibly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more careful in recent years with regard to who they have allowed access because the U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
When you try to get someone into these groups, which way you could go better than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters demanding in Copenhagen Climate Action
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and demanded by traders at the Bella Congress Center of the city to act more coherently in climate protection.
The demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event went relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists bundled small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when climate negotiations supported by the United Nations were little, thousands of activists walked through the city with transparency, where "There is no Planet B" in English and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says "Suggective".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, makes her aware of the heartburn problems that the country has to face due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the motives why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - to give the word to the world leaders, to bring a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now, and there is no way to go around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to either being masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be mentioned as he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes were linked to several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main channel, nearing several ministries.
They threw it near the building, he said, and added that they began as light missiles, but then followed by "a few large explosions."
Inside the Congress Center, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently failed to reach the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China’s main climate dealer.
When asked if he thinks that the demonstration has a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “That’s something I didn’t even know.”
He then continued in Mandarin and said, “Because the place is large, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of others.”
Examination data show hard racial air
The mathematics performance certificates were welcomed last week for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country that produce the highest performance, the evidence shows that the Four-and-Eighth players have made progress faster in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
What, however, is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), is the harsh performance gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white firefighters from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance airline increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-American advocates remained the same in essence, falling from a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample range was not large enough.
The picture of a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The cluft, which separated the white and black firefighters in 2003 when the first NAEP was captured in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points reached by the children of both groups has grown in this time span, the difference now has barely decreased by 58 points.
Some supporters of the district expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor of Democratic Adrian M. Fenty were promoted mostly by white students who are already powerful children.
This indicates that we have increased the overall value by treating those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that joins for educational equality in Washington D.C..
I don’t jump up and down for a span of two or three points,” said the Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in Eaton’s fourth-class primary school.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of test points is that the city’s high schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs I respect.
But what makes me worried is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy we have to use for our high school.
Rhee said the district had to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the highly weak students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new lesson plan, the Wilson-learning system, which aims at students in the upper classes of the primary and secondary school, which have not mastered the basic skills of the lesson at the beginning of their school course, and which are significantly behind their similar classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum from the children's garden to the sixth-class games and life-threatening experiences, was brought to Washington under former school-leading inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is assigned to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I mean, we must continue to work to make the best measures benefit the students who are below the note level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results emphasize the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while continuing to provide additional funds and resources for the poor schools that are necessary to reduce the atmosphere.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, studying urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could have political impacts that work against this important agenda.
The weakness, as with other urban school inspectors, is of course that they try to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to close the performance cluster is to extend the traditional public school year that is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
You need to increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, Janey, who came to an agreement over 185 days a year with his teacher's trade union last year, which he considers as a "milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future views
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, rises up and flashes a moment in view of the white pillars, the zipstone facades and the smaragd-green races.
Graciela's parents had barely completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was secured in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a college campsite.
Their attitude and those of the group’s other critics, who explored Gettysburg, where the lesson cost $38,690 per year, were rather the ones of a fearful visitor than the ones of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully when she was reported the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully taken the intentional message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the U.S. who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive college education needed to go to middle school.
In fact, one of the five of these “second generation” Spanish-Americans closes the college – which is a remarkable performance since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workers.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and a drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who have high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children as they come to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer time.
If you consider children whose parents have no experience and skills to help them in searching for the way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, said.
We need to think about providing for these children a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded the Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a high-speed run - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that begin when income-sleeved students are and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi oil ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry show that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been parallel to war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only share two out of 10 scattered fields for themselves.
Seven American companies paid for participating in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that has issued an order has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for enlarged fields in June.
The subtle seeded representatives of American oilmultitis in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European companies have announced the way, said Ruba Husari, issuer of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, probably have abstained from American oil companies, analysts said to engage stronger in Iraq, which possesses the third-largest proven raw oil reserves in the world.
U.S. companies were disadvantageous in some cases because competitors, particularly Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower salary costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained close relationships with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the largest in the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its partners and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
For the tender tax, selected companies gave offers, which were then compared to the price per barrel oil that the ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al-Qaida's top plans seem to be killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is expected to have been killed this week a top Al-Qaida action planner, U.S. counter-terrorism representatives reported on Friday.
This would be if it would be confirmed that the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in northern Pakistan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s illegal tribe.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents who are suspicious to belong to the soldiers ran to the place and quickly took everything left of the “fullly destroyed bodies”.
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. fight against terrorism led uncertain evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al-Qaida, leading terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy around the world, noted a leader who wanted to remain anonymous, referring to the terrible character of U.S. air strikes on Pakistani ground.
When it takes its central role as a given, it also includes the planning of attacks on the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al-Qaeda and reused them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had risen quickly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does in no way reduce the risk he had for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al-Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed since September, when in a similar attack, Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribe, and three more top activists were killed.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined from an average of six operations a month since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website spoken by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their aggressiveness, while at the same time brutally killing suspected information.
U.N. Senator will resign in Kabul
U.N. chief ambassador to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, ending a storm of office, which was tormented by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-supported Afghan presidential election.
Eides withdraws when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Ambassador said he supported the army rise, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. schedule for the military withdrawal to begin in 18 months could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their army forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian assistants to help in the political shift of Afghanistan.
The army rise on the military side must correspond to a rise on the civil side, he said.
Eide said he did not establish his office, but only fulfilled an agreement made with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he would like the report to the UN-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now redirected to take care of a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban, according to UN representatives, has started looking for a replacement.
U.N. representatives say he has considered Swedish-Italian staff di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put on trial after his former Deputy Representative, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential elections and committing evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has rejected all charges, but he also said Galbraith's charges - which were fired - "the mission has undoubtedly damaged because there was already a large degree of scepticism regarding international intervention in the election."
He said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the U.S.-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successor to stop more staff from the United States and other Western countries donating for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper spending of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment in the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the U.N. regulations have undermined his possibilities of bringing people into Afghanistan.
The UN rules have been designed so that I have been able to set up only one person since May, he said.
It's disastrous and can't go on.
U.S. Defence Minister Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be imposed "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, taking the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good choices in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such development.
“One of the things that I am on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is our own unpredictability to the war.”
Obama’s government is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average siran.
He said a "packet of positive and negative incentives" is required to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "your people will suffer unhealthy" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government has joined European top politicians in warning that Iran has to expect "credible" consequences if he does not expect the requirements of the UN Security Council and its come of nuclear power, the International Nuclear Monitoring Organization.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be gained only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said he would restart the talks to restrict his nuclear program and resign from a substantial part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since that time, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the interim agreements -- partly, experts say, because Iran’s leadership is unconvenient about whether they should be committed to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community with regard to some proposals they had already agreed at the beginning of October has, openly said, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, combined in a way that they never had in connection with major additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set on December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he continues to pursue other options, including those that Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "expressive sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what she on Thursday called "unfunded and unfunded allegations" of some security council members on Iran's nuclear activities and said they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to "a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he met with the soldiers in Kirkuk and flew with Kurdish officials in Irbil in the oily Kurdish region in Iraq.
The tensions between the Kurdish and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and due to the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to prevent delays in US plans to reduce US troops’ strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to spread the Kurdish concern about the upcoming military withdrawal. U.S. representative quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, “We will retain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
Change of course in China's growing age
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up around propaganda posters that held their lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a tomb more."
These lessons have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started changing the course by the low birth rate and the elderly population this summer, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was instantly and final: “No case.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, depleted individual children, lovingly called “small Emperor,” a population crisis in the country is rising.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy entered into force, the UN said.
The Department of Population Questions is determined, while the population populations from 60 years of age and older in 2020 will rise from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 per cent explosively, which is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalances are stronger in rich coastal cities with trained populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people have represented nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate is less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in fertility age need to get babies to help reduce the relationship of older populations and reduce the labour shortage of the future.
Shanghai will soon be "as old - but not as rich - as industrial countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the 1978 constitution of the country, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy have to count on enormous fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed this policy to avoiding the critical use of natural resources, while human rights representatives have condemned abuse in the implementation of policy.
In rural regions, some pregnant women who had already had a child were forced to dismiss.
Many couples also had done sexually selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004, they have approved more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was demilded.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Peking University’s Population Research Institute, said government representatives recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children in which a partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters taught families to have only one child have been replaced by guidelines almost overnight, which describes in detail who is in question for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information leaves under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction wasn’t just encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Desperate reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said a resignation is to be recognized by couples who want a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts do not report any changes.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications per month are still an example.
Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be about 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai Municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are likely the main reason why many people don’t want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children, and this is also legally permitted.
But they, as many Chinese, own only a small health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West assess one-child policy misrepresentably as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, we have the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples provide psychological reasons for their complaints.
Wang, the staff manager, said she just wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to all of us to take care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others, and we don’t really want that.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it was unforgettable.
For parents from the middle class with a double career, by which the rate of birth decreases, he said it turns to be successful and you need to be selfish.
The age group of 20- to 39-year-olds today grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they don’t want a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, puts huge requirements to the time of his parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life plan -- "If the child is nine months old, you have to have a curriculum for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
“Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of life,” he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UN Group Develops Emission Reduction Plan
The UN-promoted climate conference -- which has been marked by wild posts and mutual charges so far -- has again focused on the publication of a document on Friday, which will highlight an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, while industrial nations will have to take the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he has been considered an important progress in a negotiation that goes out as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a specially created UN Working Group, is silent about the amounts of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can manage global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large-scale countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit value of global temperature rise should be to contribute by policymakers.
The process will be given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, chief representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarised a 180-page long negotiation text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has referred to as “the big whole”.
It shows the basic rise of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020 compared to the limit values of 1990, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also provided an increase in the negotiations on Friday by providing $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change – from the masters of floods and droughts to avoid desolation.
On Friday, however, they brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had set up last week.
The U.S. Climate Specialist Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions of greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger developing countries, if not funded by industrial nations.
The train announced that the Obama government is running a harder line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign any agreements without the rise of larger developing countries and taking measures, so stars, who also complained that the text did not go far enough, can ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by foreigners.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after the statement of Chinese Vice-Sea Minister He Yafei, who said that it was either a lack of reasoning or it was "highly irresponsible" by him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not financially help China with global warming.
The future economic marching direction of the great world powers has opened lines between the industrial nations and the thresholds.
The current struggle equally refers to the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, while China and the United States are subject to their corresponding commitments, while the poorer countries claim that the two dozens of most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the great powers should fight for who should bear the costs of braking greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have been more aggressive to take account of the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, as Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impact of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said the talks would lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of the small islands with 43 members submitted a 24-page contract draft early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states "exerced political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and require measures from developing countries, such as China and India.
The talks were newly urgent when the delegations focused on the fact that most open questions must be clarified before the heads of government arrived to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Minister, have emerged from their planes and run through the Bella Center’s gangs to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to hide claims to be negotiated over the next week.
The pure scale of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to the Congress Center a day and go out, guitar-playing activists organize night shows in which they are fun about the countries that are betrayed and sold in their opinion, and contract designs are hand-to-hand transferred rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just based on: almost all major ministers are here now and 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen from Wednesday.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights come.
UK's first 225 km/h faster train defines Monday's feeling
Monday morning at 5:00 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the dark to announce a journey that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed drive train in the country will reach 225 km/h to London St. Pancras in Ashfort, Kent, and return 93 km/h in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will then move aboard the first Javelin Pender Service from London.
He hopes that the UK’s new service will eventually be connected to an international network of faster, reliable trains and will connect the large balloon areas of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The negligible province could become lively pendular cities, working hours would be radically reduced and the shift from planes and cars to the train would reduce national carbon emissions and steam on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, which could still push inevitable planning battles and concerns about environmental damage in the UK high-speed railroads.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a conductability study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on December 30, according to the Times.
This provides a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed rail network.
The new train line to connect London with the West Midlands will be conducted in urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 also aims to create three options for a larger, northern-leading high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route driving, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a departure would lead west of the Peninsula to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railroad insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours to 40 minutes.
The first partline that would not be opened before 2025 would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today in a little more than an hour.
The designs punished the trains with a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive it.
Up to 18 trains may be operating on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would, in turn, mean that a final station would be needed in London, where 20,000 passengers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, an existing train station is expected to be expanded to undergo the high-speed network.
Train experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston has this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be pursued in his opinion or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he puts the wheels in movement, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains must first change from the high-speed routes to existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, making the travel time between London and Scotland remains more than three hours.
This is considered a crucial point to ensure a shift from the plane to the train, a direction measure for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come for the mortgage for £75,000 of a conservative’s ranking
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-home member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orange that he was building in his home in his election circuit.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron, because he complained that sub-home members had to live “from smoother rations”, has raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to build an eagle woodworking building at his second house in Rutland.
He was able to charge the taxpayer’s additional interest rate, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The sub-chamber officials approved the applications at that time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducted a review of the expenditure of the sub-chamber members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "clear or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-home members, owns a two-storey house in a village in its electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of nearly a million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, a expenditure control center of the underhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he grew up a winter garden, which is called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked during a recent review of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to make an opinion on increased money receipt.
The Committee released him last month after an examination of his expenditure from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (EUR 300,000) from his London House to his election cruise, which he had purchased in 1991 a year before his election to a parliamentary member.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as a mortgage interest rate by March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan’s RBS mortgage interest rate has not changed during this period, which shows that the entire increase in funding was 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal steep-free RBS mortgage rate decreased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest papers published by the sub-house show that Duncan continued to have its right to £1,250 per month in May.
Duncan lost his position as an opposition leader in the underhouse in September after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the issue scandal that parliamentary members would live "from more magre rations".
Essentially, it means that when you work for the state you need to live by more delicate rations and how to treat S***.
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and raised the right to a very small portion, measured on what belongs to it.
And I could have requested all the damned sum, but I don't do it."
The parliamentary member, a millionaire from his former career as a oil retailer, was first attacked in May because of his spending as it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had cleared with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as an excessive demand".
As a protest in Duncan’s grass, an activist has buried a hole in the form of a pound mark after it has become known that he had requested 4,000 pounds for over three years.
When he was questioned about the increased hypothesis last night, Duncan said, “This was approved by both Fees Office and after that by Legg to increase values.”
He added: "There is no debate about deviation and cross-section or commitment to the rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all of your believers to admire Brighton’s Beach House Advent Calendar
Beach houses in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1, and visitors were able to watch the latest house every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free dishes and traditional Mince Pies, with dried fruit-filled bags.
The so far selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the cabin decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorable spiritist of the Chichester diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said, “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach house advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday worldwide and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where police have made hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion until Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the Climate Conference, has contributed to the increasing mobilization of the world for the climate, which shows that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, had broke off the windows with plaster stones and hamers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-anxiety police officers immediately and without consideration have intervened.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your estimate, were arrested mostly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent division groups, which have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has undergone the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers have been arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that approximately one hundred of them have been arrested on the streets on Saturday night, despite extreme colds with hand sheets and position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped approximately 500 meters away from the building without attempting to enter.
A scene was installed to welcome the intended speakers for a evening with candlelight, including the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators came with buses and trains from large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue rain pads, have made a first ride in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of Earth’s friends to form “blue times” for the “climate justification”.
Today, we are going on the streets to demand a renewal of ecological guilt for the South , said Lidy Nacpil, Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t continue and say to ourselves, “We have time,” said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that can be walked dry, water ride, just as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
European Member José Bové, a form of globalization critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific space, where many islands are particularly threatened as a result of heating, has given the start-up committee for demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have gone to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
There were hundreds of people in Manila, mostly students who were marching in Red, and who had been in Bandanas where you celebrated the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (Western) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, declaring Georgia that it is a "street" here.
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, which took place a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi declared the "streak".
Around 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control over the South Osetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The elections closed at 17:00 GMT.
The election was about 58% hours before the local election, according to the Abchash election commissioner.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former President Serguei Bagapch, are categorically rejecting the idea of a reunification with Georgia that condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakachvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceived it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After the separation from Georgia during the conflict between 1992 and 1993, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia, through this election, wants to prove that it is willing to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to choose in a election place located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Big pictures on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian President and Governor, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the execution of elections.
We, the Abkhasian people, are grateful, he said, at a small celebration, as an appeal to the support of Moscow, especially in terms of the decision to recognize Abkhasian independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, has raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, as those in Abkhazia Russia left control of the rail for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit value, a second election round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday all over the world to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive the delegates from 193 countries seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train went towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters away from the center and have not tried to penetrate.
A scene was built to welcome the intended speakers for a evening with candlelight, including the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train was passed, a group of demonstrators who were fully dressed in black and were armed with backstones and with hampers began to hit disks, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-anxiety police officers have immediately invaded you and invaded you without mind by throwing some of you into the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that it is mainly members of the Black Blocs, these extremely violent divisions that have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg in April, in the east of France.
At night, a police officer during the incidents in which, according to police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested, suffered injury by a blast stone, four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in custody," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said while helicopters circulate in the air.
Most demonstrators arriving by train or by their own car from German major cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue rainbow, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after calling the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group that should represent the "blue seas" for "cloud image justice".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the south," the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition said in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say to ourselves: we have time,” says Benin’s singer Angélique Kidjo.
“There are rivers in Africa that sealed, there are water flows through which you can walk, which has never happened before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was introduced in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the opponent of globalization has approached the environmental protection organizations.
French MP and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference now between the fight against earth warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilised several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who address the masses.
The Asia-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to the warming of the earth, has led to the demonstrations.
In Australia, approximately 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizations.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in most of the students, dressed red with Bandanas, have made advertising for solar energy before the city administration of the Philippines capital.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
During the demonstrations organized by the "Network of the 350" several hundred people joined in France, particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
A number of people met in Geneva.
The fields of geography and history, according to Chatel, come out of the school reform of the high schools.
National Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Sunday" that matters geography and history are reinforced from the school reform of the high schools, even if they are not required to be taught in the 12th year of school.
“The students of the Première (11th school year) now have the same program every four hours of the week,” Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "they have to overcome this apparentity," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but, in general, a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not be a subprofile of the scientific," he continued, "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who had been involved in the lack of historical-geographic education in the terminals on technical licees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in humanity found that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the state project of deletion of mandatory teaching in history and geography in the terminal S (12th year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also undergone this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister responded, however, that there was no question regarding a restriction of the philosophy of the programme of Terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called on Tuesday to protest the project, which, in their opinion, becomes victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister concluded that they undergo Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year of a professional-related suitability examination and at the end of the year of an authorisation examination which examines their teaching skills.
In addition, they conduct practices during the year in M2 and then teach students as teachers in practice a year before.
He continued: “If you add all the practices offered before the performance examination, you can reach even more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
Finally, the minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in people's education."
He once again confirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to address on Saturday at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP found, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences in which experts addressed the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to do something that makes people feel like they want to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, and one of the organizers of the day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event comes back to the name that students have given the fish in the school’s base.
“Among the experts were selected for the twenty participants of the discussion, even after their charisma,” he said.
"On climate heating can be spoken for hours, but the core goals can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of films about 50 people before.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he emphasized in the hope that listeners will understand that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolute serious scientific dossier."
The videos toured by these conferences will be found online on the school page from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months.
Payment delay : angry prisoners, planned actions
The trade unions of criminal enforcement officials called on a general action day on Friday to achieve that the prizes and overhours of which payments were cancelled for budgetary reasons until January are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The Second Union of Criminal Officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") urged employees who do not have any services to demonstrate and block them in front of the Criminal Office on Tuesday morning in order to pay attention to "theft of what is happening to them".
The 3rd Union of Criminal Competition Officers (CGT-Pénitentiary) urged "to agree on a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of overhours, night-climbing and sun- and holiday climbing in December will be burned as "harmful and unacceptable".
The first trade unions of criminal enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Penalanstalts Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "general mobilisations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The management of the Criminal Office and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overhours increased significantly in 2009 and not all were provided in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice told the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of criminal enforcement officials, guaranteeing that payment is made next month.
“I know very well the staff’s efforts to keep our criminal enforcement system functional and to modernize,” the Justice Minister said in this letter.
"I have ordered the executive authority to take immediate measures so that such a situation, which has occurred due to a lack of over-hour assessment, does not repeat itself in the future," said Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore less, except for the management staff that enjoys high service and target rewards, the UFAP/UNSA explains, for which the "budget walls" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional FO trade union in Marseille is engaged and announces to boycott "all assemblies and initiations" to new instructions.
“The staff does not go on sun and holiday days at work, then the hours of October in December are still unpaid, and that is also true for their overhours,” the FO Rhône-Alpes Auvergne also threatens.
“At a time when more and more tasks are being charged without being set up more staff, the attempt to enrich the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate,” the Bordeaux CGT Association said.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, notes the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes he distributes Christmas more and more gifts than he gets himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is going to spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, told TV spokeswoman Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
At a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening over the ABC channel, President and his wife Michelle gave an insight on how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-foot family companion, will be with the party.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” says Michelle Obama, and adds that the dog will also get a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's allegations on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she naked the president.
"So please," he shouted sharply and shouted on the First Lady's pearl chain: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known TV moderator, which Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about gifts they had most loved as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a 10-round bike and a basketball that his father had very rarely seen brought to him to Christmas from Kenya.
“I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball,” the president said.
“First a lot later in my life I realized that I had this ball from him.”
First Lady remembered her puppy house.
"I didn't even know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the cabin. But I loved this little puppy house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms that he was moved into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "injury" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated on Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had detected "injuries as a result of the operation of a bandwidth accident" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company required in Paris.
However, the singer’s production company wanted to clarify that the situation was “under control” and stated that a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
Only after 48 hours, however, there was somewhat more certainty of the patient’s condition than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither confirmation nor comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "it comes from certain sources" that after its first operation, "no drainage" was placed in Paris.
The rocker was operated in the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a band drive incident.
The intervention planned over several days was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments on RTL.
After the operation by Johnny Hallyday, the singer was introduced on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles due to a subsequent infection after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who was very close to Johnny Hallyday, had the view that his friend was going through a "deep valley" on Thursday, but he assured that you need to "don't worry" about the rock musician because he's a "good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a weakness to sit on a plane after such surgery for twelve hours, that's not going," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday “reacted well on antibiotics” and that “the infection was depleted.”
Mr. Camus also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and he had no special concern.
However, the concern about the singer's health has become increasing since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, it was a general surprise that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer OP" which led to a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a goodbye tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not found that the singer on the stage had an effort to move.
Only in mid-November the people around him had to demented a re-entry into the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kursbahn: First place for bousquet over his favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title on his favorite distance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane trains were allowed, there were only three world records, while you expected a real record flood.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m layers of men.
Damage for bousquet who wanted to hit the 50m free style after the world record, whose record is held in the large pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in the swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec., in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe in increasingly larger, and in the present case I said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try it.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane trains that are prohibited from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epos in Istanbul, which started in 1999 for the first time at the same competition.
The use of the combination this time has not been paid for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer failed to improve his best time over 400m free style (3:32.77) but he performed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Denmark Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my duty.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
US: Zola’s tomb plate is estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman cemetery, which appeared with French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday, Sotheby's art dealer.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century to Christ and has always been rated with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysos in a sophistic architectural decor, surrounded by satures and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the Enlargement of Roman and Egyptian antiquities.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is surely what the buyers have mostly offered so far," said Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble by Emile Zola goes far away.
The plate was nearly 300 years at home in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then she broke pieces in pieces with French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and appeared at Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In browsing the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelayas trip from Honduras to Mexico has been completed
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the falling Honduras President Manuel Zelaya on domestic ground as no longer compatible, after this jet was rejected by the Putch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya at the night, everything seems to indicate that you are unanimous about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft sent by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, returned to his place of departure.
The Putch government wanted M. Zelaya to "thank" and ask for political asylum abroad.
The ruined president refused, however, because he wanted to return to Mexico as a congratulated, official head of state.
The Putch regime "have suffered a resumption by trying to move me to give up on my expenses . . . they wanted me to give up," said Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he often reports to the word since the beginning of the political crisis in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay well here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the falling president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two months and a half ago, with some agreements.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for jealousy, but we cannot accept it, since it did not include asylum, on Wednesday, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch Government, told the Honduras Radio HRN.
I am not looking for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the channel Telesur whose headquarters is located in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only take as president of the Honduras people.
The rumors about the departure of Mr. Zelayas had mobilised on Wednesday the supporters of the falling president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and then the military had strengthened its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to its assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was crushed on June 28, on the day of the folk query organized by him to prepare his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves this, he is imprisoned for high betrayment, of which he is accused of justice, according to the Putsch government.
Putch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to dissolve Mr. Zelaya.
Although Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial elections, it was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argenia or Brazil.
Three days later, the cogress had massively voted against M. Zelaya's return to office until his mandate expired on January 27.
Wall Street in the rise, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high level, the numbers of the American trade balance testify to a rate recovery of the shares of the United States as well as its partners: the Dow Jones has 0.67%, the Nasdaq added 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405,83 points, Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190,06 points.
The Advanced Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was added with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from different industries, Lindsey Piegza judged by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotic under the premise that the market focuses only on "half glasses", so it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo by Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixed on the numbers of the U.S. trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion compared to September.
The analysts, on the contrary, had calculated a deficit growth.
Imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the rise in the overall volume of trade, particularly in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the U.S. main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell by the company research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have increased against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers has been "falling to the depth of the year over the past four weeks," Scott Marcouiller by Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
Obligation market has declined.
The profitability of government debts for 10 years has risen to 3,482 % compared to 3,432 % from Tuesday night, the profitability of the debts for 30 years to 4,492 % compared to 4,408 % from previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans standing in power pushed out "Ladies in Weiss"
Some hundreds of partisans standing in the Cuban power expelled wives gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and also unite another announcement, due to which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
For the 40 "ladies in Whites", wives or neighbouring political prisoners, were exploded on the open streets of the government by partyans under Raul Castro, just as they were on the footstep to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a reporter confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", the authoritative partyans with uplifted faust scanned against the dissidences.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who appeared to "see their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the evening, where neither were injured nor arrested.
On the contrary, in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who also appeared on Thursday to demonstrate the International Day of Human Rights were temporarily arrested by civilian police officers, a reporter of the AFP confirmed.
According to this reporter, the dissidents forced by the partyans of the government to enter civil vehicles under the use of violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As prosecutors to the 2005 awards awarded by the European Parliament, the "Ladies in Whites" have organized an unauthorized move for the purpose of the "Bit for the release of all political prisoners" whose number, according to the dissidence list, has about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders of 20 years in prison, whose husbands are Hefesi.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind gitters.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "solders" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
One rare thing is that Cuban television reports on the demonstration events held on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contrarevolutionary" reports.
This one party, the Communist Party, led by Cuba is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of enlargement of rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of expression.
Crazy kills eighty-year-olds with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-knife-armed madman killed an eighty-year-old in Clichy-la-Garenne (Clichy-la-Garenne) and injured five more people on Friday to late afternoon.
The 28-year-old attacker had injured the 80-year-old for an unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, according to police data, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man born in 1929, according to a police syndicate alliance officer in the hospital, reveals the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, approximately in the three-year-olds, has been injured and injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured is in danger of life, because, according to police sources, it is apparently affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman was worried because of the incidents, and she is supposed to be hospitalized according to a police source in the "chock state".
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence, should immediately escape on the streets, the equivalent Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passengers, apparently by accident: a thirty-three and a forty-year-old, while the latter is heavy from both.
The scenario remained dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives that he weared behind his back, Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine region, said on site.
Several passagers, including young people, should have attempted, according to the witness reports identified by the AFP, to restrain the madness.
I saw a guy in the three-year-olds with a green west.
Three youths tried to enter.
They failed because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a kellner of a neighbouring bar.
A horde fell on him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the hand link.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at home number 61, two city police officers, including their boss, have tried to arrest the armed man and have been injured with knives.
The event took place in one of Clichy-la-Garenne’s main hits, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers came to me to tell me that there is a injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought her into first-help position and noticed a complaining wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty-year-old, was injured by cutting wounds.
Finally, police forces have arrested the man who had no exit papers with him.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre has commissioned the District Reference of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case information.
The madness was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not conclude that he is delivered to a nerve healing facility.
According to another police source, six police officers doubled him at the police commission in Clichy, where he was led.
He was "in a state of excitement" such as "all spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the tapping process".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer calls for a suspension of law enforcement
The French-Polish filmmaker’s lawyer, Roman Polanski, has repeatedly requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to allow legal prosecution against his clients currently in his residence in Switzerland due to a sitting breach of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the Pianist, has opposed serious trial errors at the time of negotiation in 1977 in front of three court judges of the Appeal Court in the second district of California.
I demand a penalty release at the point, Mr. Hummel said before he added that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband at the time of the negotiation with the case "it lets a cold back run down".
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who was now dead, before he fell into his court, had discussed with a state prosecutor who had told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which represents a serious procedure error.
This discussion was postponed in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), particularly by the questionnaire prosecutor David Wells.
Wells had finally declared that the authors of the documentary film were "leaning."
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr. Hummel requires the leadership of a trial that would allow him to submit evidence for his argument.
On the other hand, the accused has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the revocation of the charges imposed on the accused cannot be taken seriously unless Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled from the U.S. in 1978 before the prosecution was announced for "unlawful sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he hasn’t travelled to the United States anymore.
The Deputy State Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "has to be there to attend the negotiation."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that the escape is a possibility of exit?, asks Ms Asayma.
In their opinion, the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and despises its authority.
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days of time to announce their decision – even pointed out that “there were other alternatives to escape.”
Hummel wasn't the only one who requested the arrest of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also reiterated the abolition of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer be tolerated by any resurfacing of the affairs Polanski and added: “No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-three years are enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the occasion of an American arrest order.
After spending two months after Gittern, he was then sentenced to death in expectation of possible detention for home imprisonment in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is broke by the rise of the dollar and ends without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Friday without a course in a market that was lowered between better indicators than expected in the US and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% and the Nasdaq lost 0.03% on the other hand.
Based on the final figures available at close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65,67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has issued 0.55 points to 2.190,31 points.
The Advanced Index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
“Honorably, the market is quite quiet,” Mace observed by Marblehead Asset Management.
“He remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very small, and I think this will remain so until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "aid to improve market views on the solidity of the renewal of the economy," said Charles Schwab’s analysts.
In the U.S. retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus two months afterwards and much more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence has significantly improved in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to an index of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were stirred by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level in relation to the euro for two months, “the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation are pushed down,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost somewhat on the ground.
The Obligation Market has declined.
The return of the shit loan over 10 years has increased by 3.540 % on Wednesday evening, compared to 3,482 %, and the return of the loan over 30 years to 4,497 %, compared to 4,492 % of the previous day.
The Miss World in South Africa
After a month’s round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World on Saturday will exceed the last obstacle to fulfill their dream: to be chosen to be the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this before a billion TV watches.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already had their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut off during their African stay to Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model.
This was a true strudel of fun.
Beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Kap Hoorn were simply exceptional.
I have seen a lot of things and made a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be transmitted live on Saturday, from midrand, north of Johannesburg, at 17:00 a.m.
I couldn't imagine a better country to give my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have done this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russin, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous experience exchanges with candidates and the re-discovery of "admiral landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and safari, the miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to take place in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as the Aishwarya Rai, which was elected in 1994 and both Bollywood stars became.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates are defiled in traditional clothes and not to forget, in the bathrobe.
The presentation is presented by a television moderator, Chinese Angela Chow, by the former South African Beauty Queen, Michelle McLean, and by a director of Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is not able to receive the world with a barely superior heartfeltness and pride, Julia Morley, President of Miss World, assures.
The candidates, like last year, have made a safari visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time cost the bicycle and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was exceptional.
Unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
However, their most beautiful memory remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (Southwest) for the football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country, to promote a little more for this event.
I’m wrong with people I’d probably never get closer.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive" according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” his son David said on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything goes very well, said David Hallyday to the press when he left the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "the fastest" move to Cedars-Sinai hospital, delivered to Johnny Hallyday on Monday due to a bacterial consequence infection after a band band accident in Paris on November 26.
The singer was moved this night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was moved by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles into an artificial coma in which he was introduced on Monday due to a bacterial consequence infection after a band sheet surgery in Paris on November 26.
The singer had to be subjected to surgery again in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French gymnasium in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer of the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The manufacturer has severely charged the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique International du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had set up the cleanest massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles said they were completely disturbed, Mr. Camus said.
I have heard that you may start a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "is traveling too quickly and this is with the Paris surgeon's permission to Los Angeles."
I personally phoned this doctor, who assured me that he viewed this journey as completely unproblematic, which, however, had very surprised me since I have already had two band drive operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematome after a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a doubtful reputation, who has already been condemned several times due to failed operations and not forget about tax reduction and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Doctor’s Chamber, called him “a man without scrap” who has “regularly” to be responsible for the Chamber’s Board and is “all other than recommended”.
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux issued a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "no bleeding caused and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer’s tournament, whose health problems have emerged since last summer, appears to be questioned.
It is clear that it is a little too narrow for a continuation of the tournament on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr. Camus said.
The UDF Party Association (Union for French Democracy) becomes strong and calls on the Nouveau Centre to no longer use its seal
The party association, supervised by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, has on Friday on an attempt to take the seal of the party, once established by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the President of the Party's Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and has not responded strongly and has not asked him to reject this document under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take this UDF seal as he believes that François Bayrou would not deserve to defend this political heritage after he had left his hand.
Moreover, the Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to further his efforts, he had received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC) who gained a claim to own the UDF brand, as he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrial".
However, the business story of the UDF’s supervised party association of François Bayrous’s friends broke the silence and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be dismissed and set a deadline to the Minister and the Deputy under the threat of a judicial persecution, to no longer use this seal and to transfer the property of the brand.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would suggest your political movement to take the UDF Seagelzu+, the party’s alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central alliance.
They also believed that you were entitled to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF+, on their political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF headquarters said and calls on the NC party to "remove immediately the name of the UDF from all materials and from (these) websites".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal claims".
If you refuse this, we will file a complaint against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they emphasized that "UDF has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds that Morin and his friends have "taken the election" to leave this 2007 to start a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to set up the UMP party.
Therefore, according to the signatory, the Partie Nouveau centre has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la democratie française).
They continue to remember that the UDF’s last 2007 Congress adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party, as well as the establishment of an office to defend the “material and moral interests” of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the business office continues, "he has not been a member of the UDF for three years at the time when he has requested the brand name," but the UMP.
It profits in a scandalous and fraudulent manner from the absence of the deposition of the acronym UDF to carry out this for itself.
In addition, keep in mind that this ignorance is the best way to transform itself into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems to us in politics and in life to make us a name more generous than to try to come from anonymity by not imposing a name on a fraudulent basis."
Affaire Liliane Bedtencourt: François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to evaluate the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he claims that the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt has used a weak moment of eighty-year-olds to hide part of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photographs, will be responsible for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, for a crime that is charged with a maximum three-year freedom penalty and a fine of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this affair that is worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are pregnant and at the same time have the shoes of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Chamber arranged a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bedtencourt, which is carried out together by three doctors.
So far, L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder refused to undertake such an investigation, not particularly under the conditions submitted by Nanterre's prosecutor's investigations.
The doctors appointed on Friday should submit a report before March 10, 2010 in which you will clearly report whether and at which times Liliane Bedtencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll be undergoing these investigations.
I will talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt’s attorney, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiation.
As regards the attorney of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banier) manipulated this old lady that you need to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bedtencourt’s only daughter has initiated a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to give her a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On her side, Liliane Bedtencourt had always rejected being manipulated by the photographer that she viewed as a long-term friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the complaint initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers of the lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
As such, Liliane Bettencourt’s attorney appealed to three of her client letters sent to her notar (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she misrepresented the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bedtencourt added: “Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to the banier for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
I have never been able to talk to Françoise since her marriage.”
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre once again believes that the applicant had no right to respond to this, especially because a prosecutor has rejected her application in the last few days to initiate a defense procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bedtencourt "is fully legally qualified, is not under protection and has no predecessor.
No one has the right to act in her place,” confirmed the Attorney’s representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to make a judgment after the proceedings on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of strategic early learning?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been free of charge.
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "value" determines the best as it was previously designed to impose on consumer products by the technicians in the factory.
By giving the customer the focus of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of the markets on the ground ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors to repeatedly impose customer preferences regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demorality.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon, particularly affecting employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, particularly on those of R&D and, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) requires "a proactive approach and a future-oriented perspective from all parties"; it requires an employer who fully contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we demand an operational revolution that would consist of putting employees equally at the center of the company’s concerns next to the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to his wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm scared, unfortunately.
“First, because I was able to find that the whole wing, in view of a new situation after many moves, finally achieved priority in doing what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the significance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behaviour.
From the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanical.
Through intellectual comfort, they take over the old behavioral theory, which has recently been reactived by the U.S. "neuroscience" and was unconsciously widespread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "Hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a current survey of Le Figaro.fr published by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for the present world.
Identification and measurement of the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol in any consideration or practice of control: for the recipients, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambition and plans.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate managers can control, predict and predict their “social performance” and place their Human Resource Management at the right place.
Thus, they create a fertile soil that is affordable to develop robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Speech of Oslo: The "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The US rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama on Friday night in Oslo and was pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 defended the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had dismissed the award to Obama on October 9, this time applaud the President's speech, the example of the former Vice-President Candidate at the 2008 elections Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, explaining Palin, the face of the right-wing of the Republican Party in the USA Today newspaper, and added that she itself has brought the theme of a "sometimes necessary" war in her later lifetimes.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, attempted on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, represented the opinion that the president made "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt this speech completely historically, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former deputy, considered to be some of the possible candidates for the Republican nomination to the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen a "left president" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could not give a prize for peace if the use of violence would not exist.
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to representing himself as a “cosmopolit,” as “he always does,” he “speaking like an American president” when he pointed out that the Europeans “live like in a security bulb that they have not created themselves and for which they do not do much for their protection,” Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a Falke of the Era Bush, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "loud, high-speed and inspirational".
At the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the back attack on the armed forces.
If you packed the war under the rooftop of justice, the massacre can easily justify the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praised on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize has been awarded early to Obama, described the question itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, as a "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "offers an end-to-end plan to manage international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper enthusiastically said.
The New York Times believes that Obama has "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and referred to his speech as "deep and exemplary at the same time".
Remote driver: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply to Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the road alliance and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that would end the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass to Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport Dominique Bussereau welcomed the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And that although the three employers associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict “warms a lot of harm to the companies” and “it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year,” Bussereau said.
The agreement provides an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
Thus, the hour rate for workers with the lowest wages increases from €8.72 to €9.06.
“It’s not very much, but we’re starting a little bit,” Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now ordered to no longer block the supply centers.
"But there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
Philippe Grillot, chairman of the TLF, spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "tough to raise these wage increases in view of the international competition".
According to him, the increase of EUR 170 per month for the low and EUR 100 to 120 for the high wage groups.
“This agreement is based on healthy human mind and respect for employees,” says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) said of “a historical agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed himself in this regard about "a acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3 % increase in travel costs, as well as the maintenance of the overall road transport rate in the first half of 2010, which in particular will allow the 13th month salary and the modernisation of tariff contracts.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the decline in employers' fees of €100 million" was subject to a government amendment to the draft law for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday night.
The government calls for a "identical" vote by the Senate.
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies associated with the organization, and then to apply in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the entire occupational status.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", says Bussereau.
The opposition of the employer associations can only delay the process.
The FNTR alliance pleaded for a "fraud trade" because the 100 million euros were already promised to compensate the sector for part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to dilute the Gans-eases on the next Christmas Day, the Unostra complains.
For the association Otre, the deal threatens "to swallow a large grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the coming 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances in this weekend, trade unions unsatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on line RER A, the largest fast rail network in France for the Greater Paris Area and Île-de-France, continued on weekends, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the RATP (Independent Paris passenger transport management), the strikes were awaiting to continue paying for their demands.
At this important shopping week before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready to use and only one of four trains was ready to use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travellers to move.
The sales chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP seeks to connect large businesses technically".
The RER A line passes the Paris balloon from the west to the east.
The route section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one out of two trains was scheduled for the main traffic time, and nearly none during the poor traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human excitement on the railroads, as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had set up the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crossed than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnastics.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work in time."
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of travellers through staff and order forces, pointed out that there were no insights at Saint-Lazare Station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or traveled through Saint-Lazare Station to ensure the connection to the metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers were held again, while the results were verified, which the associations were classified as "probable" after the meeting with the leadership head on Friday afternoon.
The RER business manager proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for line RER A regarding all relevant aspects, working hours, vocational trails, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they require a long-paid wage.
The CGT was amazed that the RATP itself puts its salary proposals in clamps and emphasized that the headquarters "is unable to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clearly stated that a re-assembly for Monday is intended for a "complete review of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignore the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers searched for the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the headquarters that refused any discussion during the strike until now, and a meeting approached after a reassuring situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to line RER B after an announcement by Unsa and Independents.
The associations require a salary increase of 120 to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents), and also complain about the deterioration of the working conditions on this route on which millions of travelers are traveling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of work experience, shall cover a gross tone of EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 as well as a wage addition of EUR 600 to EUR 650 for layer services, as well as sun and holidays.
The Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdic Party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the pro-Kurdic main party of the country; a decision followed immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens the government's work, which strives to give the Kurdish community enough hand to end the conflicts that have been undergoing for 25 years.
The "Parti for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities that are harmful to the independence of the state and its unity", said President of the Constitutional Court, Hasim Kiliç, four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been unanimously taken by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution, and he also pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the President Ahmet Turk and parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, for the duration of five years, were dismissed by political parties.
In addition, the judges announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, the enjoyment of Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the consolidation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The leaders of the parties expressed themselves before the judgment that parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than to act as partial parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure in 2007 launched by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, accusing the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political view window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that there is no connection to the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court functions between the government's endeavour to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurdish people in order to stop the support of the PKK by the Kurdish people and to end the conflicts.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-explosion of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan’s detention conditions in recent weeks have led to conflicts with police.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the DTP’s spaces in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurdish.
The ordinary forces used tears of gas granates and waterfalls when the demonstrators began to throw Molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the court’s judgment, Turk assumed that the court’s decision would “deep down the despair” further.
"Turkey can't clarify this question (Curdic, i.e. editing) on the basis of the ban on a party," he said.
The government, consisting of a party resulting from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties in principle.
This doesn’t solve the problems,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government,” said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
“Obviously, you can get caught up with a response from the PKK,” he added.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks of the past few months.
The snow break can come
A good winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not just because he wants to send the citizens, the FES Winter Service Chief said.
Instead, so that your employees can try and learn to control the entire vehicle technology.
It could be so far for the first time on the weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES plans to do this according to a precise plan.
As soon as it is covered in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degree, 20 so-called A trails are decomposed with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main traffic and transit routes such as the New Road and the Hanau Landstraße.
But also firefighters, ÖPNV-routes, pedestrian zones and routes with incidents, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES begins at 3 a.m.
The roughly 1040 kilometers should be distributed for up to three hours if necessary with moisture salt, which is better fitted.
Therefore, the FES begins at 3 p.m. at night, "to allow the routes to be free until the vocational traffic starts".
It will be hard if it is only snowing at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, the winter service manager says, “because no one is willing to place the scaffolding vehicles.”
Only after that, unless it continues to snow, there are supply and relaxation routes, which also belongs to the Council-Beil-straße, on the row.
The last priority has side and sideways.
There will be complaints, White Brauburger.
At 5:00 a.m. the FES’s foot people are on the road, hazard points and transitions are prioritized.
For all the bicycle routes, the FES can usually not take care of it.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in mind from 22 to 4:30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since this is rapidly light, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the string is on the way.
If necessary, it is also called by the police.
The weight of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-free dinosaurs: the two meters long and 1,50 meters large animal runs on two powerful back legs, had a long shell with sharp, bored teeth, short arms with seal cralls and a long swing.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived approximately 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Panga near the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the relative relationships, the spread and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began with a gravel on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we have found a dozen dinosaur bones on a day, which is unexpected for deposits from the Trias, team member Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones identified the researchers quickly as a new type.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi Indian sunset.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional finding: "Dinosaurier fossils from the trias are extremely rare, most often only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This invention is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, therefore the allocation of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, experts discuss when the eagles split into their three main development lines: the meat-feeding theropodes, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and the birds known as "language" examples of four legs belonging to the saropodes and their relatives, and the species of the species, and the plants of Oruri.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as well as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than the breathing of the breastfeeders.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine seemed partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive theropode with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the gigantic sauropodes later also had airbags and lightweight bones, the common precursor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Since the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers say that the eczema appeared there for the first time.
Accordingly, the three development lines were separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth that were still a single country mass as a supercontinent of Pangea.
The fact that the team, along with Tawa, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropodes.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrated ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-writer of the Science study.
Moreover, there are also objections.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says the Bonner paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted image could emerge because in South America, just a number of primitive dino fossils have remained, while it is hardly possible to find anything on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptiles tribe to the dominant agricultural animals of the medieval age, it is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today’s crocodile and the air saurier, and with many other eagles.
By the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relative disappeared from the border of the Trias to the Jura.
Successful history did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, Martin Sander said.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story would not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack of a group of animals flourished, which had already evolved in the Trias, and since then had freshened a shadowline: the pets.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatures are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are at the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police raid of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University strikes waves around the world.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and South America, solidary with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they were "missident" to the police intervention by the presidency.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had left the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the educational strait last week because walls and artworks had been damaged.
Five students were injured.
The injuries, the signatures judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events by students and teachers by a police command".
The smoking represents a "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "deligitizing and criminalizing the protest" and disconnects from the content.
The presidency has withdrawn the necessary discussion.
The teachers require the immediate suspension of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the damage, it says.
Protest legitimate
The youth of the Verdi Union and the German Union also solidarize with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, Verdi Land Jury Secretary Alexander Klein said.
Hessen’s Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the process of the Unipresidential and Police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU's last day deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions SPD, Green and Left saw this.
The CDU takes painted walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, it has been dismissed.
The left has filed an application calling for the Interior Minister to report on the use of police.
New Silicone Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten headquarters of the capital of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strictly guarded location for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 km from the center of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have linked contacts to the Frankfurter Science site Riedberg - with the universities and companies of the Frankfurter Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg now signed a "protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt planner Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research centre will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it’s also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be allowed to walk on the growing Russian market.
In contrast, Russian scientists want to make orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutions and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large Sitronics companies and Rosssijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called “socialist plan city” for the arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the forested hill landscape in which the research facilities are incorporated.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 cannot be high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply and simply about "the new heart of Europe".
The S21 is much more than the depths of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will fall down the city of the Baden-Württemberg country capital for a decade in a heavily chaos of construction.
Stuttgart 21 was derived from the spirit of the 1980s.
Main railway stations, which ended in the middle of the city, were then regarded as the 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes of a modern railroad, since it once took a huge amount of time to restrain locomotives from behind to ahead.
Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in.
The main train stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a trail station located about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, which is why the slogan of the heart of Europe.
S21 is now being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian Grand City it is almost unpaid to implement the depths.
Nevertheless, headway stations have no problem with entry and exit since there are modern racing trains with driving vehicles and driving cars on both ends.
Still: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new route to Ulm is now going on.
National and municipal politicians have implemented it.
The train also supports the risks of the largest infrastructure single project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the state companies.
In urban construction, the project can still be justified somehow.
There is a new city room, which - believes the planners' computer-generated graphics - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the railway system.
The transit station and road development are designed for passenger traffic, which typically led to huge growth in the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening goods transport, since transport on rail is significantly more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction path is not due to heavy rises for goods trains.
It is even more serious that S21 indirectly tanges many other railway projects.
There are six billion euros to be banned in Swabi.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion realistic.
In the next decade, money will be missing on other nodes and nodes in the network.
A total of sixty large projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the approximately 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the trail at the time.
It would be necessary to press the tube right here.
However, S21 will appear as a brake clutch.
The Rheintal route becomes the bottleneck for international goods transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The national government has left open in Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) for the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to make the comprehensive VGH judgment legally examine over 400 pages, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written on this day that the country should reregulate the ban on night air in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest Landbahn at Frankfurt Airport.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as provided by the national government, shall not be compatible with the lawful protection of the population against night flight noise.
The coalition must decide before January 4 whether it will go into revision against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this relapse and urged the government’s representatives to resign to a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election on a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as a word break.
It's fucking hard to keep his word," Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in appeal to the FDP election slogan "We hold word".
Minister Posch rejected the claim of Schäfer-Gumbel, attempting the national government to come to their night flights with "right disruption and trick".
A precise legal examination takes their time.
The coalition will not operate on the basis of a "speed first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group have never been a night flight ban.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The U.S. big banks are stripping their state prisons.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repayed the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp to a hit of a total of $45 billion (about €30 billion).
And the Citigroup also plans to refund State aid according to a report by US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to eliminate the limitations associated with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation of payment of manager bonuses and the deduction of high fees.
The Bank of America had taken care of around $19 billion of fresh money from investors.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own cash, which was well filled, among other things, by spart sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday night: The money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The cashhouse had risen to the highest point of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to acquire money on the capital market to be exempted from its liabilities to the State.
As of Thursday, the U.S. Bank could announce a severe increase in its capital by about $20 billion, CNBC said.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repayed their aid.
Quick selection
Then everything went faster than thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board had pulled out of the office Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender, the broadcaster may present a successor.
Last night, the board wanted to vote on the personality.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studios in Berlin, was his favourite.
However, there was no confirmation by the sender for this - officially not to access the procedure.
However, it may have also played a role not to further harm the ZDF-Intendant Markus Schächter, and this proposal should also not be passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächer's candidate, needs support from nine of the 14 members of the Board.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of the editing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächer, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender by another five years, failed in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members voted for Brenners, seven voted against him, and Brenner's election was a heroic defeat for the potters, but waited for a while.
Because the majority of the Union in the Governing Council had signalled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in the office.
He had organized the resistance to the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender had lost the ZDF's messages in unit quotas, he rejected another term of office of the highly regarded chief editor.
Soon before the election, there were protests in which political influence on the ZDF was influenced.
Lastly, even 35 state lawmakers had been involved in the debate, which considered the procedure to cook as a constitutional counterfeit.
It has nothing to enjoy.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referee of the chief editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "Morgen magazine"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then director of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brenders, which was elected by the industry magazine Medium as a journalist of the year on Wednesday.
Kochs’ opponent in the Governing Council, the Rhineland-Pfalz Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brenders' expected successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board of Directors with a clever shackle – criticizing the Board for it immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this document of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him for the positions of the chief editor and the board of directors without suspicion of entering into the office of a party party.
In party rhythms, Frey is assigned to the left liberals.
Study is disrupted
Share success for students: After a year of the educational stress, the country’s cult ministers finally ended on Thursday: at a meeting of cult ministers and high school teachers, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future as well.
In individuals, they agree to reduce the examination burden: in principle, each examination module should only be completed with a single examination.
In addition, it is intended to review the workload of students and ensure a "realistic and reliability" degree.
Politics and colleges also want to simplify the recognition of examination services between colleges within and outside Germany.
The countries undertake to make common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s courses more flexible.
In addition, there should be no deviating country rules.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the students’ protests in June, Ministers of Culture and Uni-Rectors have carried the foul word of better studyability in the mouth.
For the first time it was filled with concrete content.
The so-called accreditation board decided to reduce the number of exams partially drastically: "Every module usually closes with only one exam," it says in a 30-page paper that is intended to partially reregulate the admission of courses.
With the "significant reduction in audit burden," Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Council, should be provided with "deficiency that significantly impaired the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" will be the "determining criterion" for design in the future.
Modules such as content are "stretched to check" whether "unnecessary engagements of students in the choice of
Events would be avoided.
Students had "the right to obtain gambling spaces that enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules are to apply for the approval of new, but also for the review of existing studies.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, but this means that it will last until 2015 until all studies have been checked.
It is responsible for ten accreditation agencies across the country that are under the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had called on the countries to "respect" so as to affect the agencies that the substances are not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and colleges have already agreed on appropriate measures with the country’s ministries.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz has allocated additional funds for further development of the Bologna process.
From the funds, the universities are primarily designed to establish tutorship programs and to strengthen study advice, as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and colleges want to spend ten million euros.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring a novelle of the Law of Higher Education into Parliament.
After this, only one exam is needed to complete a study model.
The study is designed to become more flexible, in addition to ensuring recognition of performance evidence at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
By the end of the coming year, all of the country's courses will be checked for their studyability.
Government and opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal government of the Juso High School groups urged that the design of education policy should no longer be held “behind closed doors” of the ministers and high school sectors in the future.
At the latest after the educational stresses, students should now also be involved as "a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Rector Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need students' experiences," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the cult ministers, with which the HRK consults on a joint reform paper.
The Trade Union for Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough to Bonner decisions in general: it requires a legal claim that enables every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a continuing master’s degree course.
On the other hand, the countries need to ensure that the current generation of bachelor’s students have sufficient master’s degrees available tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, GEW Board member Andreas Keller said.
The countries need to set up significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves for a joyful access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and out is almost no control..." is the beginning of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which he themes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom, but also lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in the Romanian banana in 1951, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a reader in a child book publishing before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literature awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
For significant non-literary appearance, he took care of last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the level of their security levels".
In the end, Söllner issued a statement in which he made his work as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, before Romanian German writers.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The advertising attempts had begun slightly, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "so someone who hasn't rejected enough anti-terrorism attempts by the security."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors originating in Romania will be shocked by a case that makes the grounds and detriment of a political system known for monitoring and consideration.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say to the past knowledge, not only criminals, but also victims.
In his Securitate Act, IM Walter played a role, according to the confession of the literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He's "haped him out in all the difficult points for him at that time," says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but it is not surprising to confess a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian Secret Service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own record, 914 pages.
The affected, so you can suspect, are speculated, and in some cases may have also known what clear name came behind the deck name Sorin, Voicu, and also Walter.
Unlike the present-day very procedural perception of the Stasi acts, the handling of the retreats of the Securitate supervision is still very diffuse.
Systematic insights have been overwhelmed and disturbed in recent years.
One of the Birthler officials of the National Council for the Revision of the Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the publication of the documents was rather sweeping since.
Only since 2005, there is a law governing the administration of the documents.
According to the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar expressed abstinence over the prize winner.
She has a psychosis, but she has only been interrogated once.
The infamily of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, inevitable questions are linked to the case of Söllner, as often associated with distorted guilt.
The special response of the listeners to Söllner's confession hopes that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge demand rather than by guilt removal and shame.
For the healing of Herta Müller’s work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League
It seemed to come from a very nice Christmas celebration, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, came a quarter after midnight into a C-Klasseeg.
The man with the marvellous flattery was allowed to drive a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself – alcohol wasn’t at the end of the game, and the 55-year-old was just as little for luck.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just go right away.
In the words of the Swiss only three days before, "We have reached the eighth final," namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we should not let us blend from the success: there will be a brutal harsh fight against the decline."
The "more important task" is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal class performance in Mainz in the daily league.
And the totally revealed weaknesses after the fast three doors by removing Marica (5.), trash (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Auslosung
The eighth final of the Champions League (games 16./17. + 23./24 February/backgames 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be released on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy of the fulminating state of the Babbel successor remained behaved.
Not only with the presumed rescue provider who had given the unsafe Stuttgarter professional self-confidence, willingness to use and joy in the game in the short period.
I went on to the players and told them that they should be focused on their strengths, and I stopped them to be more bold, said the soul clamper Gross, the so simple recipe of success that was no longer timed under the therapist Babbel.
He has uncovered some magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann admits, "If a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think were possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weekly break of injury, advanced just as the best player on the spot thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected phenomenon with the pronounced "fresh wind" and the way the new director works: "He's a man who takes care of the intervention and discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it was obviously missing.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly constant.
Like Gross, players and managers were also guarded to overestimate the victory against a weakened and completely overreached defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later, when the bad awakening came to Leverkusen at 0:4, Khedira remembered.
And sports manager Horst Herdt said that a seasonal goal was achieved, but the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That hero, even after his 40th birthday after his first home victory for three months, was on the events of the weekend, which were freshly experienced in the form of a TV interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann, broadcast directly before the game.
There are decisions that others make, not the Jens, contradicting the harsh criticism of Lehmanns.
He had demonstrated leadership weakness to the Board and decided to change the trainer on pressure of puberty fans.
Also that his free day after playing was deleted, Lehmann appreciated him as a sign of lack of sovereignty and dishonesty.
Lehmann's statements are "traced by pure egoism," the hero backed and announced consequences for the final man.
You will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the pre-working by the trainer team dismissed, it would not have been possible to play and fight strong ideas.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great deal of success," Hero and Lehmann said unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in Heavy Weight
Hitziges Duell in Bern: Ever provoked challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judge expired unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains a boxing world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion after the version of the WBC, won Kevin Johnson on Saturday night by a vote in point (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the World Champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, the K.O., which everyone has expected, has failed.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to beat himself due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2,02 metres large Klitschko wanted to dictate the battle with his left hand.
The eleven centimeter younger Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko-era before the duel, but repeatedly escaped the hits of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights into the target.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his hits rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he was only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who passed through the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some spine before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "heavy zombie", who "nothing can be right."
When weighing, the champion then forced Johnson to shake the sunglasses from his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also won in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of vacation, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "her" WBC shirt, which he had to release without war before.
This year he forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I had only a hit in this battle and I’m physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA belt is wearing by British David Haye, after he was able to escape Nikolai Walujew, 2.13 meters in November.
Haye had previously rejected a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko in summer.
It is alleged that its promotional company is now planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin has named Defense Minister Guttenberg as a liar for false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left require information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings about Kunduz's air strike, the opposition Defence Minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has undergone conscious fraud.
The minister said about the deadly bombing on two tank trains from September "which knows the truth," Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Dagesschau".
It is called the countryside: He has lied.
The order to kill was issued under respect of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only a destruction of the kidnappers, but also a target of killing two Taliban leaders.
U.S. air attack requested by German Kunduz Commander Oberst Klein, according to a NATO survey report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, SPD and left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan-policy – and whether Chancellor Ramt, Bundeswehr and the news service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green-Collegen Renate Artist.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor has not influenced the concrete interventions of the Federal Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, the ministry’s presentation of the reasons behind the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert was also made clear.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the tanker attack.
Officially it had been remembered that they had considered the existence of NATO reports and kept the minister sensitive details.
However, from the surroundings of the two top officials, they suggested that they had even referred to the Ministry of Defense to several reports, including a bilateral document of the commanding officer Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is now expected to have requested in a letter to clarify the case, the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper" reports.
He hasn’t received a answer yet, it says.
The ministry did not express the accusations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the federal day’s investigation committee, which will constitute on Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
Some see images and hear voices that others don’t see or hear.
Not only in mentally ills and in drug trafficking, the boundaries between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
If we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can unhinderedly give ourselves the wildest ideas and imagination.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern western world are mostly considered crazy or narcotic, at least specialling.
However, such images and voices do not only occur in mentally ills or in drug smoking.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels, sometimes make sure that the boundaries between dream, dream and reality disappear.
Dreamically changed consciousness conditions can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case wound.
Although triggers and effects may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic disturbances, psychoses, and hallucinations can be linked to similar processes.
Hallucinations or misconceptions occur when the balance of neuronal posters in the brain - all in advance of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin - is disrupted and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and boring thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection of sleep and dream has been occupied by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle's term hallucinations as a form of a wake-up dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, founded in 1861 a "great similarity of misconception with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was not "a psychosis, with all such immortalities, deceptions, thoughts."
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he swims on the room ceiling.
He feels a trick.
Behind him, the devil's shapes with bloody, distorted fragments, toothbrushes.
They hunt him, throw him with heavy, flaming shoes, throw him to the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voice, malicious voices drain from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. turns two cables out of the stereo system, knocks it into a slide and attachs it to a hack on the ceiling.
He ascends to a speaker and lays the neck around his neck.
Run!
The slide is solved.
This should be a teaching for you, shouting the voices of the chorus in a chorus of thumb, "Go to the clinic and let you be healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoactivity-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is mania-depressive, he takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The foolish images are cruel reality
About a percentage of the population has schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics, it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people can no longer distinguish between the inner and the outer world, they fall into an impressive state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
It is particularly common to hear - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter alarming signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the slices for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centric, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Clinic Heidelberg.
Schizophrene is in the center of the event, everything has a significance to it.
At the same time, he plays a passive role, he, like in the dream, is overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively make them.
Therefore, schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible for them, the fraud images are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the meaningful and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains essentially preserved."
The dirty thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the promotion of life takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain hit caprioles, researchers still face mystery.
Exceptional situations can lead to the loss of reality in a short time, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It appears to be a genetic enthusiasm for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only factors that determine.
Researchers believe that there are minimal brain damages in those affected.
We assume that the neuronal maturity of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, by a virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But there is still a mystery about how the disorder of the neuronal system occurs, which does not even manifest itself at first over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogene drugs can also cause psychosis as they interfere in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and scratch expensive drugs to get rid of them, spending money on drugs to get what, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Kasten.
Whether fraudulent images are felt as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of the point of view.
Kasten has collected reports about hallucinations and fraud phenomena for decades, last year he has evaluated his results in the book “The Irreal World in Our Heads”.
Although hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, they often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and pancreatic brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people is hallucinated.
Hallucinations, such as boxes, are composed of memory content that are usually kept back.
They occur when brainreales in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain runs hot or even when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritation, stress, love room or other mental exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one-third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gym there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there were no pictures and voices.
In the pause, it can occur that a slim boy with long, dark hair applies to it.
When it answers him, the students are surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the embarrassed girl is a desperate day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel her presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, sometimes she asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other cheating pictures are not real and disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are most scary.
Often, the scams are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher just presents a new co-school in her eyes and ears, while explaining mathematical equations visible to all others on the table.
At night, the phenomena are most scary.
When she waits to sleep in her dark room, which comes too rare and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bloody cutting wounds on arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Let me be quiet, she shouts the shapes.
Parents and friends don’t tell her about what they think they’re crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She lived the Abiture last year and lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist on the internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from irritation, he is likely to have some hallucinations after a while.
I suppose that the brain is then under-employed and self-cares for its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls her father since she could think is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult to distinguish people like Sarah K. from false pictures and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain develop, so they seem so real.”
Even night dream images value boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of health care do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenes, mental health workers are able to recognize their counterfeit images as irreal.
The box therefore advises its patients to evaluate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our very conscious world, imaginary experiences are mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chef of the Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Clinic at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also provides positive, creative - despair is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called uneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-changed consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed Quasi dreams that the experienced person considers real and that he can’t even be different from the state of awakening.
The uneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme trauma or disease-related situations, for example in patients with polyradiculitis who experience a motor parallel in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, e.g. by persistent, complete movement inability, he replaces the life-threatening realisation with his own, imaginary world that is unconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A sort of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a change in the world takes place, but the reality is in the imagination.
An intense form of senselessness and senselessness in an intolerant situation that allows us to undergo our own designability in nothing of consciousness loss.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Zürger’s art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book “Heart Change” as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness occurs after a heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation for days, while his body is condemned to movement insufficiency at the intensive station.
Claussen enters a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedtime man, an old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot awaits his health.
He lives in the early medieval ages among agiles producing drugs from blood.
If a Greek is climbed on his motorcycle in his home country, he surf with his hospital bed in the Firn Snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely into the imaginated events, everything is real, even later in memory.
These internal travels differ fundamentally from any dream for clauses.
Dream is a different condition, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are clear to me even after years and in neighbouring details.
Clearer and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Lastly, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drugs smoking show how fragile our internal images of external reality are also in guarding.
Any change in consciousness state, summarizes the psychologist box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children will take over the publisher at 27 years old
The new publisher chief Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his business into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
Holding will also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company long-term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit 27 years of age and have the strong will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have carefully regulated the details of this.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
7500 employees cannot present their children if they are not sufficiently skilled.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the chairmanship from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen was appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Callen has been a member of Burda since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the company’s assets were responsible for this and after the deceasing of Jürgen Deadhöfer also for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member stands at the top of the edition.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of calls also serves to overbridge "10, 15 years", according to Burda.
Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that family companies are not sure before the collapse: “This always concerns families who have been infected by a capital seizure that have completely speculated and thought they could rise to such a big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had never had world power dreams, so Burda.
I don’t see myself as the political predator of this country, as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the World League with ‘Time’, these stores have become too large.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least it was what El Corte Inglés recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in Callao (Madrid) shopping mall, where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find among other reputable companies such as Hedonai, who take care of laser enthusiasm; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatment; the hairstyle Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or hire the relaxation area for two hours to sit your own "beauty party" on your legs with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual coaches that take care of the customer’s training units, providing them with a perfectly personal training.
A training unit starts by entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including heating and dining exercises) are perfectly enough to train the body muscles.
If, after you have trained your body, you want to look forward to the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for recovery of hair, glance and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusiveness appear to be the keywords for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 pm to 22.00 pm in the evening 365 days a year.
The most varied decorations
Christmas is getting closer and therefore it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their festivities into our wardrobe.
The form of the decolletés, which is very important to advance the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an overwhelming and very complicated decoration. You can only abbreviate it.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electrical company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the LIVE office.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE Office (Logistics for the Introduction of the Electric Car) will define and coordinate the Roadmap for the Introduction of the Electric Car in the City and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, granting, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is currently being developed to promote electric cars and to summarize the views and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the transport means of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework treaty with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement would like to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative to participate in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is involved in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a "horizon of tranquillity" for the automotive sector
Government President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the prophecy of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's cropped exporter, is "a horizon of calm".
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the actions the government has launched to support the automotive sector during the government’s year.
"Without the car industry's competitiveness plan, we would have had a panorama today of the negligence and bleaching of some of our main production works," the President said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automotive manufacturers to produce in Spain in the future in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the consent of this industry, which is our crop export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the total car industry plan (PIA), provided 800 million euros for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided more than 3 billion euros for investments.
The head of government said that these investments are designed for both the development of new models and the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also emphasized the government's efforts to boost demand, in line with Plan 2000E, which will be applied in cooperation with autonomous communities and automotive manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce the gases in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, resulting in a "strong growth" in authorisations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Auto Show is held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.
This exhibition will be held from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
Not only can you admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all the only memorable items related to the world of motors at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
In this way you can find at the exhibition exhibitors accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniaturautos, etc.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic motors that will enthusiast the collectors and lovers.
Among the companies that will participate in this exhibition are Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of cars, specialized in Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests in the auβen area

Skill tests are also carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a self-furnished race path in the outer area of the exhibition floor.
Mazda3 i-stop: environmentally friendly sport
Mazda wants to prove that sports is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic motor stop and drive system, based on the name i-stop, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out in the overall image through its good notes.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its straw behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seat can be found that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good stand.
In addition, the game of the wheel is excellent.
With further views of the unit consisting of the instrument board and the armature board, you can find that Mazda is located in the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colors of red and blue.
This style reminds us of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, without furthermore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3, and Civic, both the Japanese models, are removed from the nudity of the German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf that everyone wants to overcome.
The passenger space of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can first drive comfortable with the car.
All of this comes a groumatic and clear-formed luggage room.
The stop and touching system is available so far only for the 2-liter gasoline engine with 150 PS and a 6-road circuit.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It stands out by its pureness, its empty noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine due to its severe comfort in the circuit and its low consumption, even if Mazda is especially the diesel models that are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the sample journey is a particular feature, as it has a significantly greater number of elements from the series equipment.
From the series replacement, mainly the assistant for driving track change (RVM) highlights that eliminates the dead angle, as well as the controllers for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the Bluetooth computer with a high-speed screen, the sensors for single-parkingB, a light-luch and a rain-eto, the independent air condition.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if it weren’t enough for equipment, the premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to additional elements, especially the learning Bixenon lighters and the sound system BOSE with CD-chargers.
Fazit
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly excellent with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
Moreover, those who don’t retreat many kilometers per year can also buy the i-stop version that is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative of this model is to be a little higher price, between €21,770 for the Luxury model and €23,270 for the sampled model Sportive.
However, in return to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving space every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red teppich of sensitivity for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, were more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as usual, chose a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is firstly limited to a device that only allows you to read his emails without being able to see certain attachments or browse through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine to be one of the products of the year.
It is quite unlikely to see on the Strav, but the idea itself is still especially of interest for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the price of an iPhone’s flat rate.
After the company’s success, it has introduced two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, quite unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for Europe.
Those traveling around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the country border or desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or an opportunity to connect to Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly reluctant and should have been possible for a long time.
It’s true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but I think you already need a doctoral degree in physics and a good glass to read all the small printed.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming rates for Europe has almost always remained unaware.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and that’s right.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (when it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer this type of rates means that telephone providers have to think slowly, but safely, and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices is the download of books and other requests on the Internet.
Without vegage and no hacks.
This is an internet-powered device and you pay for it only once, namely when buying, and not monthly.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day to offer a life-long internet access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is definitely the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At Barack Obama’s office as President, she appeared in a dress and a cloak of this color and re-elected the same color to accompany him with his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
On both occasions, Michelle Obama weared very similar models: besides that it was almost the same color - a brilliant green - the clothes were made of three parts - dress, jackets and shirts of the same fabric, and for that, she weared a slightly groovely stitched or a necklace.
It is even as far as it seemed at first glance that the first lady of the United States wanted to follow the pattern of the princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different from the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the official introduction, she wears a dress made of top and in Oslo a patterned samt.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-touch pieces and for the second time an end-to-end model, but golden colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hairs were covered as a haircut in this case, before it was wearing the hair open.
75% of professional mothers have suffered problems at work due to their maternity
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who want to have children.
This results in cooperation with the CSIC’s Women’s Institute for Women’s Fertility and Career in Spain.
The survey of 9,737 women aged between 15 and 75 does not doubt: 75% of the women who are occupied see their career opportunities on the labour market limited due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are serious differences in deciding to establish a family and the number of children depending on whether women work or not, and if yes, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half a day or have no fixed work contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women with a fixed job, especially in the public area, move to the establishment of a family and maternity, and therefore also have fewer children.
“Women in the age group of 35 to 49 with a fixed employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the gathering, a number rising to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment, who needed longer to achieve this, and which have achieved their first child much later.
Moreover, the kind of work also has a serious impact on maternity, although less than the calendar regarding pregnancy preparedness,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
Educational level is another factor to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to a survey, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the educational level.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only high school or higher education, were on average 25.1 or 32.1 mother for the first time.
In addition, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While women with the main termination already get married before their first fixation and get their first child, women with a middle or high school graduation do it exactly differently around and only seek a fixation and then get married and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to his all-sided list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also the widely known advertisement "Because you are worth it."
"Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant international actresses, will become another famous hanging shelter like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones who joined this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional messengers: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangile's play colleague in "Lost").
The award of the British fashion industry
In the fashion world, the British have been involved in an important word.
Their top representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual awards held at the Royal Court of Justice in London.
For this reason, they all appeared.
Ex model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen to be the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the thirty-six X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and terrifying genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a similarity to the bright heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves no fear or excitement.
Auβer, that this book is a delicious reading, is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some sections from the book.
“In reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost meaningful tribe, just as I always felt, without finding words for it: joy in contrast to unhealthy fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, Allegorian Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, had between power and ignorance, with a surround poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband has been born by this woman with a passion, who has endured for thirteen years, whose meat, due to adultery, has been united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that existed in it to come to heaven on the way of destruction."
James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world’s literature, one must climb on the northern wall, on the wall where the best mountain climbs are always trying again."
William Faulkner: “It was a comic chauz.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the inheritance of a good owner of the county, and again he said that he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams witnessed a certain Gröbe."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the crazy shouting out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo was deep into his literary way until the night of the 20th century.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: My God, I beg you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave, these verses are ingraved by Spencer: ' sleep after effort, after the wind of the port, / rest after the war, / after a sad life, you find pleasure in death."
Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with full normality when she told him that Eduard VII spyed them between the Azalees or the birds sang in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic girl whose literary talent was much bigger than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but trying to float Joyce into Baroja?
What, then, did Benet intend if he did not drive Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What then did Cela do to destroy the fame of that man so that he could stand himself on this podest?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada last week, when a group of young men between 15 and 18 years of age suddenly came next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture we took out of the animal house, weighing six pounds just once, and then they hardly missed him out of the hot sky.
Our disarmament can’t even be spoken, because it’s incomprehensible to us, because where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the leaf.
This is also the first-hand attack that a woman who was going comfortable to walk when she wanted to address these people because of the accident, she was even afraid of her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might be the same with a woman, a child, an older master, or perhaps even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally calm city neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon at a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has remembered the whole day.
Of course, we have made an announcement in a nearby police office, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from beginning, we just want to clarify that the fake criminals were Spanish.
Our dismantling of the event has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what these young people have to do in their minds that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal, a funny animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don’t know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
Tire manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial) to promote helmet use, especially with younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies announced today.
This initiative seeks to pay attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle crash.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which "is much more comprehensive than just designing and manufacturing products that are increasingly safer every day" and further confirmed that it also helps with other pedagogical and informative actions to get closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will be distributed into more than 500 motorcycle stations in a first phase to achieve the best possible spread.
Finally, Michelin emphasized that transport safety is a "continuous concern" of the company, and just because it always considers itself as a manufacturer of tires for two-road vehicles to be one of its main objectives to be the development of increasingly safer products.
Sales of small trucks is rising a little again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November represent a rise of 12.6 percent compared to 2008, and, much more importantly, they are the first rise with a constant decline in 22 consecutive months, compared to the figures presented by the manufacturers' association and the Ganvam auto dealership.
However, these good figures are currently only to be cautious with great care, as the reference data used to compare from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of decay with a 60% decline in the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, in addition to the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles consisting of the small transport market include passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter trucks/cars.
Moreover, the same wind clouds are still in the sky, which attract the demand most in compassion, because although some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the large part of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases are purchasing with a third-party funding.
This means that these restrictions, which are the consequences of the credit institutions' contribution to money, have to include further factors, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the persistence of poor economic situations.
With this panorama and unlike passenger cars, financial assistance has little helped in buying a vehicle of Plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for independent and small businesses, if they want to buy a small transporter with a CO2 emission of up to 3.5 tonnes, which may not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Yesterday Ganvam recalled that the state had to pay special attention to these small loaders, as well as of course to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Auto Traders Association prophesied for 2010 a year similar to the past, for which it is expected to have a 19% sales failure (in passenger cars and land cars).
Supporting braking in critical situations is now required
As with the ABS anti-blocking brake system at the time and as with the stability control ESP right now, the emergency braking aid systems must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already obliged for all newly approved passenger cars and light small transporters, for which the rest of the vehicles have been fixed a carriage period until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's decision to take the lead aims to improve the protection of fugitives, but these brake systems can also help prevent many failures due to their operations.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver which identifies the system using the brake strength carried out by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not carry out this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the manufacturer of components for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collapse no longer came to the brake pedal and half of them did not have a full power brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the contrary, enters the brake system with maximum power, reducing the braking time and thus the braking distance that a vehicle returns during the braking process.
According to a EU study, up to 1,100 deadly accidents could be prevented every year when all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even less accidents - one is expected to prevent any four accidents with individual injuries - as soon as the so-called smart emergency brake systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that identifies obstacles (via a radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while already carrying light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the collapse is inevitable, the braking assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the employees of the Opel Works in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first April week, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the U.S. vehicle manufacturer suggests that it takes more time to finish.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the party concerned already agrees to each individual point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where works are present, may be moved by early 2010.
On the contrary, GM is assured that there will be a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the U.S. car builder so that it will make a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to be in contact with some new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but gains the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, who has a stronger rear cover from the Russian group Converg.
If there should be an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to drop Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until that time, will continue to be maintained.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewelry, engineers used the Boxster S as a base and really managed to make it easier for 80 pounds, bringing only 1,275 pounds to the weight now.
In order to create such a thing, they first abandoned the automatic climbing roof, replaced by a tent wall with a manual drive, so that only one saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3, they "small switched" back by B3, another 15; with the exception of the air-conditioning system, another 64-part was also added to the 13;
Then, by resigning from the audio system CDR-30 again six pounds less and by exchange of door handles by fabric handles, the missing pounds were reached.
Although it is also available with the PDK double coupling drive, the sampling was carried out with a vehicle with a 6-day hand drive, mainly on the smaller countrysides of California, on mountainways that were really very curious.
With his driving behaviour, only the note can be given to him.
The reduction of his weight has nevertheless resulted in that he would no longer be so safe on the straw.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we haven’t tested a small and light model, but at the same time a feeling of serious safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles at a low time in the necessary time until we give him the orders to hurry, brake, recover, and then again take everything out of his engine.
He does everything you tell him. The car does everything we suggest to him with our hands on the wheel, thanks to his direction, which is as communicative as accurate.
And he does it with the accuracy of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all taste directions
The sound of its V6 Boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) is quite successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the motor noise, which was already used for the first time at Panamera.
The acceleration capability is inconceivably brutal, whether it's out of the standing or when it's accelerating again.
Federations are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the landslides on which we drive with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the hit holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do all the way; and that, although we found some of these curves ice in the morning grey and roller split in the morning.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultraliquid car, a car with which you have an undescriptible driving space, as otherwise it is probably more rare and there is much more than just a little improvement in the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70.831 EUR.

The singer, a bus girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion views of 'maison', she presents her bad face with the same neck starness as her pockets of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Basconia gives herself a victory in Israel
The Caja lab celebrated, despite the many prominent players in Dusko Ivanovic’s team, an excellent triumph of 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus arrives at the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight times the best of his team.
The team of Vitoria could replace the significant failures of Mrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a gross dose of use and teamwork, even though they were mute waiting for their victory to the bitter end.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples made mavbbly a contribution to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the bluerots, which were at the top of the display table from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, you could already realize that they had come to the game field with well-heated handbags.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, but the team from Álava decided to play Barac’s inner side and to play Eliyahu’s game when he returned to the team with Pfiffs and Applause, which is his home to expand his advantage further until the pause (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" review of Splitter already realized that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
However, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game has not been determined for a long time, and the Maccabeans wanted to remind the Vitorians again that not everyone won on their field, and thanks to the repeated attacking "hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the “gelben” turning the rope (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but all other than dead, had to prepare a few match trains with match security to get back to the air, and one of them suddenly came to the guns of Mirza Teletovic, who could with three almost consecutive threefolds and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that on the display board, Vi54 was displayed again with the third time of the 6th distance.
The Alaveses were blowd in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned sincerely in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, not the best of their team, and tried to give their team strength back through three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, although Splitter was put off because of Fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, he defended himself well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaya from being given the head
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, in a game that was characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which facilitated the victory to the Greeks.
The Malaga team was neither afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opponent team, which maybe is one of the strongest in Europe and possesses a lot of money.
Thanks to their first quarter game, the Andalusians were able to dream of an aggressional defence and three consecutive trips, two of which by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the host blew 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja event, although the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the display board in 13 minutes 22-20 in their favour, the minute, in which it was almost qualified due to an action to beat between the two Americans.
The Greek team began to finally get warm and his superiority on both sides of the game, while the exit of the English Joel Freeland due to a injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left behind significant traces at Unicaja.
Among their inner field players and Lithuanian predator Linas Kleizas, with their three-folds, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, even managed to compensate the difference of the match performed in Málaga by 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to avoid the many failures and the exit of the Scottish injured during the game Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to Cook’s drills and the use of Lewis again a little hope for 66-57.
However, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, once he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not braking.
In the 37th minute, Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62, and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to resign from the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you earn due to your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users now, thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with most ads of real estate, jobs and cars in Spain, can learn their salary that they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salary of users using more than 140,000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form on Facebook in which their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish workers were on average “badly paid,” said the Trovit responsible for the product, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross wage of €45.226 and a French 31.059, unlike the 24,000 euros a Spanish earn.
Consequently, a truck driver has a net annual salary of €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is the net of a client with €11,592 per year; followed by the work of a seller with €14,725 and the work of a worker with €15,667 per year.
The most searched jobs on the internet in the last three months are those of a driver, a semi-day station and a social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The president of the office must leave the diplomatic representation no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to television TV Globo that "Mel" said he had to have left the message he had found since September 21 asylum before that date.
"He is surprised that he must go on January 27 because his mandate will expire on that day and he must seek a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also cited the former president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the date set: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the rear coverage of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (which Porfirio Lobo highlighted as a winner), Zelaya assured that he will remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed to recognize Zelayas' status of an asylum-seeking politician that the "de facto" government wanted to force him under Roberto Micheletti's presidency.
Thank you very much.
After the most fascinating days since last spring in which the assets inflation was the dominant mood on the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural condition, in an environment where the brokers make decisions about a naturally unsafe future.
The withdrawal applied to stabilize the markets was to compensate for debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave the liquidity free hand at interests moving around the zero so that the banks purchase assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been completed as well as, and without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, they will begin to seize some sand into the line, as the ECB has already made with its annual increase, next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox deviations and we will see a reverse in reducing the risk prizes.
The fluctuations of stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, although they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to state the private risks and government debt rise again.
The U.S., Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the Eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had been hardly affected by this episode of instability so far, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to bring the moral risk defenders who once again tried to create a consciousness of what they had caused, since they had the devastating effects that would have resulted in the limitation of loans to loss of jobs, which actually had a new day of burning Dan.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates, and development in Greece was previously anticipated.
A government that dismisses debt, elections, and a new government that draws the same strain.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungarian will save from the failure of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and, consequently, a member state of the euro will no longer meet its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the duty to maintain the stability of state funds in the need of exceptional deviations.
Yes, we are, as expected, before an episode of normalization of the risk prizes, after some expenditure to too high amounts, this would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences decrease and the Spanish increase continue, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While these preferred indicators require a large portion of market research institutions to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which does not bring back all the long life scenarios with a Japanese tropical scenario for the Spanish economy.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment “precaution when driving” is noted.
Connected branches
Iberdrola's Chairman Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first before the Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, discussing Spain's energy supply strategy in the next two decades.
After his appearance, on which the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán of the press gave some point of view about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and 60 billion additional from that date by 2030, under the precondition that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that you should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal systems with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, it is assumed that more 18,000 MW is needed, under the natural preposition by other "support energy".
Galán, who believes that the joint venture for a sustainable economy, which the government has just adopted, is in line with what his company has requested, would never say anything against this law, how to stimulate national coal consumption, which would be precisely the opposite of all policies in combating climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, it is clearly put in this direction, despite some "individual" mappings, as it described by the President of Iberdrola.
Whatever it is, Galán says, you already have to make the decisions on investments, even if they are in the long term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework will be created to attack them.
Ferrovial gets "handling" from Aer Lingus to ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at the ground airports, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no numbers have been announced, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Kastilien-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares have signed yesterday a protocol to cooperate with the aim of establishing an Innovation Center for Intelligent Infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million to 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be the examination of energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona struggles for authorisation of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Highlands are its competitors.
A 5km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the eastern coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and automotive operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration for public-private cooperation (PPP) had decided to advance the project according to a business plan set by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a definitive list of candidates for construction and manufacturing management.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amounted to $1,047 billion in Australian dollars, with three consortiums, mostly European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia’s grown-up construction companies, while the second is one of the best specialists in deep construction in Italy.
Acciona’s team joins the Northern Direct Consortium, formed by the British company Laing O’Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last consortium in the narrowest election is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), also the native Baulderstone (own of the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and the French company Razel, which has speculated on the public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises enormous construction work and privatisations, however, it has a barrier to overcome because only by purchasing a local construction company access.
A strategy that follows the above-mentioned companies deep or bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which the Spanish building giants still have to follow.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30% participation in the high depth, the owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the highest importance in this geographical area for the industry, where it is already well known as energy supplier for its activities and in the desulfuration industry.
Additional assets have already its grew windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies entrusted to build and manage Adelaide’s desolation plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate and use these synergies in these two areas to obtain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and heated by Northern Link (Northern Transporter), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the transfuse road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometers through the tunnel to the city of Brisbane.
The schedule issued by the city administration anticipates the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this route is already to open for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two drive tracks in each direction, an electronic mouse system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government participates in the funding with $500 million (308 million).
For the highest, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia, which signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday, has repeatedly granted significant orders.
ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fiber cable through its native subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet started the construction work and has received 129 million.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to €75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has earned over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers long for a highway in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the addition to the construction work to expand the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine enhances its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will last for more than 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore receives an advertisement from Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Mrs. Rushmore's agency for the next two years over a sum of about three million euros a year, the railway company reported.
In this Treaty there is also the possibility of two extensions of each 12 months. Ms. Rushmore has been elected among 16 agencies presenting this competition by Renfe, of which 4 came to the end, including TBWA, which has been responsible for the advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and manufacturing the campaigns.
France Télécom is a fine of over 63 million for the disruption of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of €63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed networks and mobiles by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programs for consumers at the edge of the regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than 560 million euros for fines since 1994 for disability of its competitors.
The punishment that was imposed yesterday was even increased as the competition-guarding authority believes France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore resigned.
Application Trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet in order to increase revenue from businesses not originating from the telephone connection.
This application website of Orange is essentially active in France and the United Kingdom.
You need to wait until 2010 until these sites are available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has been a source of revenue for the football club since 1992.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since, bringing them into the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring fame, it is also one of the main sources of income of the major associations.
The league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) participating in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in the third place of Europe, which has earned the most money by participating in it, and which is the only one to win the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The official Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 ranks fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took the most money by participating in the previous Champoins League.
And that even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only a third place in the countries that could owned money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious objection is explained by the complicated payment procedure applied by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization whose chair is Michel Platini expects revenue of 1.090 million from the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA expects 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs who participated in the qualification precursor (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who struggled to participate gained 3.8 million because of their blue presence, in addition to the €550,000 for each game they dispute.
There is also a bonus for winning (EUR 800,000) and an undecided (EUR 400,000 per team). The clubs who have come to the eighth final get three million each; the four who have come to the quarterfinals get 3.3 million each.
The last four get four million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, receiving 5.2 million.
This is how a football club gets at least 7.1 million and up to 31.2 million of fixed income.
Barça earned 2.5 million wins in the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are intended.
This money is given in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
The Master last year will receive 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa group has made details about the purchase offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire a limit of 25 to 29,9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers € 1,5025 per share, which is paid for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday the sos shares closed with €1.85, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of €1.50 reflects the real rating of Sos again.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a 15-day time period to communicate their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the Authority.
With a graduation, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to rebuild his management.
In the attempt to stay on the edge of possible purchase offers and the court courts of his former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal audit.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman to take a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post that is directly subject to the Chairman of the Group.
This is all other than polemics because the company is involved in a judicial battle for suspicion of relief from more than 230 million Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar’s loan, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) joined the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their decree.
CNMV approves the public exclusion tender submitted by the investment company Mer by Paternina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by the Investment Company Mer for Federico Paternina on October 9th.
The supervisory authority stated that it approves this tender after it has been proven that the terms of the law may be fulfilled and therefore the content of the declaration document submitted, after the amendments of last 2 December, may be considered "suficient".
CNMV has also notified that this offer targets the purchase of 550.008 shares by Federico Paternina at a price of €7.65 per share, which is 8.95 % of the corporate capital, which consists of €6.142.786 in shares authorised at the stocks of Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it has been notified that 5,592.778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender, and their prize by Federico Paternina was established in accordance with the laws.
New programs for evaluation of vehicles
In these days, disasters and accidents don’t just earn KFZ workshops
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are crashing into the workshops where an expert needs to evaluate the damage and the costs of repair.
No single accident is the same and the calculation of the costs for parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the contrary, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the reviewers use this type of systems.
The service and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and maintenance collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them and provide them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are made with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for evaluation and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is all other than easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are collaborating with each of them, providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the quantity of data to be processed is increasing to the point that even more versions, variants and motorizations have come to the market in the past five years than in the past fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes into the market, the business starts working.
It is a difficult task, because each individual of the thousands of vehicles must be catagolysed and its price must be entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
When it comes to a lot of sales model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure progresses quickly.
When it comes to a less common car, it can take up to three or four months, with 99.2 percent of the cars distributed in Spain available full information.
For example, the most exclusive models have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the car park driving on the Stravs, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and producing databases, and each has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
Developing this huge information flow allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scratch parts or for calculating the failure or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain but in the United States.
By reviewing the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide an overview of the kind of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution to begutachout of accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and lightweight industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the lacking prices.
This tool is paid depending on the use, i.e. for each review.
The most expensive is for customers who rarely use it up to ten times a month, i.e. 5.75 euros a month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it runs from the mounting belt solely based on the passenger number.
AudaGlass is engaged in the vehicle drives, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for vehicles declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or in order to obtain information about differences in brand and model.
For example, you can investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to paints, or how many of them had been involved in a serious accident during a particular period.
Gt motives is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It distributes Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides the same digital images, access to parts or prices, and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions to assess damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years, and the sales amounted to 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and founded in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops in Spain.
The total sales in the world of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In addition, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and today its shares are trading at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been at the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Increase of car accidents on the Internet
Last October, the company Solera Autoonline purchased a platform for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles on the internet.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer to its customers more services and value increases, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals such as insurance companies, consultants, car hire companies, workshops, slots and car dealers who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed daily and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose passenger number has been disconnected must no longer be driven on the straps, but certain un damaged parts must be used as spare parts.
On the contrary, cars with historical value may be re-approved even if they have been disconnected after difficult entry.
Cost proposal of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in just four steps: ID of the vehicle, search for the spare parts, creating and creating a cost proposal.
Easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of which include passenger cars, 109 ground cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small cars and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the repair model has been identified using the vehicle number, a graphic of the respective model appears and the required spare part is then selected.
The user may include variables, such as the price for working hours, fees or discounts, and may then print the cost proposal and communicate to its customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workplace targeted does not include estimated working hours.
The use costs for this tool are €350 per year, a amount that the customer can pay without any further.
Currently, Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have long been waiting for, for example, you can choose a door with it and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
