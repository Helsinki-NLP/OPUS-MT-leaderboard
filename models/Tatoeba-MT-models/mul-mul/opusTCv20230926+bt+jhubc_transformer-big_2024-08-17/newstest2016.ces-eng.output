In an emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend.
During an emergency call with a terrifying voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and needed to come home to them.
Lamb imagined that his "small dog" was home alive and probably excited, and that contacts to the family of the dead women can be found on her phone.
Within the police, Amy Prentiss found the body and handwritten a report on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could get it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," she wrote in a letter that was signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the doors of his office.
Deputy police officer at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university's employees heard shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
Lamb said he made a fate call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, students and faculty were forced to hide behind closed doors, the authoritative authorities are still trying to figure out what Lamb’s motivation was.
The details published by state investigators and students and employees who knew it together created a picture of a talented but probably problem teacher.
Students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no records in a criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, to thank the "good people" with which he shared academic life.
Both studied at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with the 17 other members of the faculty and many students went to courses at the same time.
At the same time, inclination occurred when it comes to problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and terrified, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was faced with stress at the end of academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for free for health reasons when he stated he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employees’ collection meant that the doctorate at which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic functioning period to become a professor assistant.
President William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Lamba probably had something troubled."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, police captured his trace when he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only gun shooter at the house court about a mile from his parents at Greenville's premises in Mississippi, confirmed the Washington state crown, Methel Johnson.
The car left on the street.
It was not clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, reading about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and educational hours.
In the spring he received a doctoral degree in education.
One of his long-time friends Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when she met through friends.
She was with her friends at high school and he was the great elderly boy who used her to play a guitar for several years.
It was a very heartbeat at that time.
The hearts of all the girls fled as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40, and lives in Jackson's pre-country.
Lamb and Prentiss are supposed to have been together for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a cave house near the Gautier River.
Police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely broken," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
About 'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Abigail and I went to the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, near Gautier, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss at the night of September 5, a pot that Lamb played on the guitar and harmony for countless donations.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We lied and recorded each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boy student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people including faculty members, employees, students and community members participated in memory events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also took part in the vigil during which the university assembly held "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this reporting.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were actually settled.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Less Seasonal Workers
Toys R Us declares that they don’t take as many seasonal workers as last year, but children’s toys and products manufacturers claim to give current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire around 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centers across the country, which is a decline compared to 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares it will begin with the collection of applicants this month, and employees will gather during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and the companies are preparing to temporarily accept employees for help in stores and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox laughs about his 'dating' with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister "Return to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre and waited for the coming of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that there would be Princess Diana," he said in a trailer for the next documentary, "Get back in time."
The film starts and I think I'm at the reach of something that could be called a fake date with a princess of Wales.
"Return in Time," is the document on "Return to the Future," which indicates conversations with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyde, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The Prime Minister's "Return for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document that has ever been filmed for me."
"Return in Time" will be received on VOD, DVD and in selected films in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said his response to Russian accelerated military support for Syria was that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict conflict and more weapons are only worse than violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Chief has urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unify and support an inclusive negotiation on finding a political solution.
On Wednesday, Ban said he planned to meet with foreign ministers with five permanent councils of countries - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of this month's General Assembly for a debate on the situation in Syria.
He expressed regrets that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unresolved."
Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and unity demonstrated by Iran’s nuclear agreement in Syria.
8 election figures that show Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to mark him as a person who often changes his opinions.
Others have few hands over, like, over an unpredictable joke.
And some are preparing for an implosion.
But even if some Republicans try to take Donald Trump down from the top of the elections, they don’t do it (so far).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the leadership of a two-digit number, and some people begin to seriously ask what this means for the nomination chances of the real estate magnate.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
Nothing says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that during this period of 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership made the way to lift Herman Cain, and none of them finally won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why it could be hit in general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bushe and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will to endure and begin to invest their dollars in a stop in order to throw him down.
Here are some recent vote numbers that indicate that real estate magnets are not just a mixable phase:
Trump’s favourite assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, the Monmouth University voting showed that only two in 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnet.
In mid-July it was 40%.
At the beginning of August it was 52%.
Six in 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 people say they have a negative opinion on it.
These numbers are in the early stages.
After the Quinnipiac University voting last week, 60% of the Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey that took place last week, 67% of Republicans said they would either be “super” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "deceived" from his candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent of people said they would be "advanced" against 40 per cent of those who say the same about Trump).
Another closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush's favourite business would become a candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his abuse and insults, 52% of Republican voters are nationwide motivated to think that real estate has the right temperament for the president’s post, according to ABC News/Washington Post Monday.
The same number is held in the Iowa Senate Club, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans believe they have the commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44% believe that they don’t have personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that their temperament is not part of the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When they set up their scholarships, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is a change from late July when four out of 10 put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters had never had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
During this past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry as a winning candidate against 28 percent for the possible nomination of Mitt Romney.
However, it appears that a number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Although Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump also defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the scattered field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is widespread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey from early September shows that in the hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets major support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Ruby by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul by John Kasichem by Chris Christ by 33 points for everyone.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead over a trader with a wide 19 points in the hypothetical match of one against one.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they’ve already made their opinion.
A new Tuesday survey from CBS/NYT shows that only more than half of Trump's voters say they will no longer change their opinion.
It is obvious that it can change a lot of things, and no one can actually say that he would never change his opinion.
46 percent say they keep the rear door open for a change between candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would have gone twice more likely to vote for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violence” in his campaign’s announcement, immigration continues to be the main and central topic of 2016 conversation.
Some are afraid that Trump’s rebellion will take away key Spanish voters from the Republican party and the damage is striving for rebranding.
But according to a new Monday survey of public opinion ABC/Post, six in 10 Republicans argue that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as the issue of immigration remains in the light of the reflectors, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The frustration of the government reaches new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of their support from Republican voters, especially due to their state of outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new Monday vote ABC/Post say they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
They are also very angry with Washington.
Voting Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated in Congress, 54% were "unsatisfied" and 21% were "infernly angry."
The House has supported a larger share of the State from coal fees.
The Czech Republic gets more than 400 million.
The House in the first reading supported the government’s novel of the upper law, which adjusts the amount of revenue from brown coal mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mladek (CSR) promised to Members that they would also get money in addition to both the state cash and the budgets of the municipalities.
The proposal was criticized by opposition deputies who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they are now because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in first reading supported the government's novel of the upper law, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger part of the profit from the game.
The share of the state will rise to 67 percent, while the share of the municipalities will fall from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The template also changes the way to calculate the compensation for the growth that companies will gain.
The change in the mining fees is expected to bring to the state treasury of Rs 427 million more than in 2013.
According to the government, the municipality's budget revenue must have a neutral impact, as the fee must be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
From the brown coal mining, there were about 200 million crowns in the municipality and 66 million crowns in the state.
Novela also calculates the increase in compensation from residential premises with permitted mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments continues to be fully belonging to the municipality.
Minister of Industry, Jan Mladek, told Members of the Czech Republic that the municipalities receive 14 million to 100 million crowns annually.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law but by the government by its regulations.
Recompense shall be calculated as a component of the amount of the extracted injury and the rates for each injury species.
According to the government, the reason for change is, among other things, the possibility of flexible response to the current economic situation.
Mr Marek Benda warned, however, that imposing a fee by government regulation may not be in line with the Constitution.
However, according to the Minister of Youth, there is no taxation in this case, because the State is paying for the growth that is a state asset.
The fees are received only by municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, they will receive three quarters of the money of the municipality and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive horn mining.
The part of the money that you are paying on the mining fees will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a rescue service.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs who claimed in particular that it would damage municipalities affected by mining and countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostové) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they are still because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions only in order to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in Auschwitz.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mostecka, Ms Hana Aulická was warned by KSČM.
Kadner and Aulikia failed to propose to reject the novel, and Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to contribute.
The reasonable report states that mining companies say that the increase in fees will not turn into coal prices, as prices are over 90 percent long-term agreements.
Therefore, main consumers such as power plants or heaters should not feel price rise.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will increase wages to compensate for an effort to reduce their operating expenses, which would mainly mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government said.
However, it believes that increased fees in terms of employment is profitable.
According to the rapporteur's Milan Urban novel, it is essential that Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, government decisions on coal mining limits before adoption of the law.
If coal is also benefited by limits, then it will have impacts on incomes for both the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Youth in the fact that the decision to break the limit down the Czechoslovakia army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of ČSA should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy will lead the Czech Republic as a single, inflicting the weather impacts.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Davis Cup bar on the table in India on Thursday, and this time each of them will be the best in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans, due to the difficult conditions, to lay burden on the whole quartet.
In Delhi there is a hot and high air humidity, so demanding matches are expected to extend to up to five sets.
We have to take it in the way.
I would like to spread it by weather.
And according to what it will look like, Navritil said at the Czech election training in the center of Radže Kumara Khánna.
With one team and the world’s forty, Jirim Veselím counts into Friday and Sunday two games.
In the position of the twins, Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to flow.
I would like almost everyone to be involved.
I have a little bit in my head, but I can't say it yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech assembly should be Stephanko's participation in the Thursday four games.
It's just the question of who will stand next to an experienced deblist who has Davis's cup in the four-three balance 18:4.
It won't be fun.
There are other options with Rosol or Adam Pavlas.
"I really don't know with whom and how it will look," he said.
Determined according to the development of the two.
The variant may be Pavlásek, with the Beautiful surprised in the 1st round of victory in the debel over the Australians.
"He's a good man," he said.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I would like to present the same performance as I have shown from the second set.
"I am pleased for your experience and I would like to bring a point," he said.
The home is placed in Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ranking), who won last week a challenger in Shanghai, where he defeated the players of the third and fourth ranking.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both are challenger players and our ATP Tour experience, but many times we have convinced that the numbers in the Davis Cup do not decide.
"It decides the momentary form, the weather," he said.
Friday's introduction two times will start at 6:30 SELČ and can be charged due to the weather.
According to predictions, it is rain and the cot is not under the roof.
However, it can be played for artificial lighting, if possible.
They already wanted it, and it has about two thousand luxuries, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Mr. Corbyn’s debut in PMQ is very excited since his election.
New job leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time he will work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after the afternoon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he asked for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he could jump over a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby’s leadership to come after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the labour leader of the state in silence during the singing of a national hymn in service on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met criticism from a series of conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the title pages of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing a national hymn has attracted attention
Mr. Corbyn said he would stand in honorable silence and recognize the heritage of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two’s Newsnight that he would recommend a labourist leader to sing a national hymn “without regard” to his belief that the monarchy should be cancelled.
Almost a dozen Shadow Ministers refused to serve in the top team of Mr. Corbyn, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in the work also "stricken" after Mr. Corbyn’s appointment through his position in the European Union and the government’s donations limit.
Mr. Corbyl noted at the TUC conference that the Working Party had submitted amended proposals to eliminate the whole idea of the limitation of dosages.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Shadow Work and Retirement Secretary, stated that the party "very clear" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Working Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The working party leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas of "withdrawn" on questions for Mr. Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
The MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confronting and that it will stand up for both "emerging responses," as well as dental trade, and instead promises that it will focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges that young people face.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow business secret, will represent him at PMQ when he does not participate — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also left the idea that he would leave other colleagues to come to him from time to time, because he had heard that he had discussed the whole matter with John Bercow's spokesman.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to withdraw from the style of politics "Punch and Judy," which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometry of the judgement of leaders, their leadership of the House and their position among the other MPs, although critics argued that they became a caricature and needed extensive reforms.
"Photographing in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn something and earn a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighbourhood and make money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Libra rises while salary growth in the UK accelerates
The Libra hit the following dates and showed the recovery of British wages, while FTSE 100 was conducted above using the SABMiller offer target.
Between May and June gains of GB including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
It was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed to be approaching estimates when rates are rising.
Sterling increased by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro to €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped by 20% after getting the offer closer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine two of the world’s largest beer bars, and the approximation of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s shares were 0.9% higher after inspiring reports from Richemont’s rival group of luxury goods.
The latest Richemont sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Glencore shares rose by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest index failure and declined by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating on the company to "sales."
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jump in the mid-year earnings before taxing £46.6m
JD Sports says higher wages could harm expansion
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, said that a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "a greater buying power in pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the buying power would exceed higher salary costs in its company, he says.
Costs could affect JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague Marshmeloun are shaking.
Controversy building got a footprint.
Investor Prague e Investmenti considers the withdrawal of a decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
A hundred people protested against the building, which was supposed to be in close proximity to the Aegean Monastery in the center of Prague, and also a petty.
The Magistrate noted in the decision that there was a violation of the construction law because all the relevant territorial decisions were not respected.
"The topical territorial decision does not contain certain aspects, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clear and clear form of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the impact of the building," he said.
The magistrate also considers the fact that some documents for decisions were issued to the original documentation discussed but changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental bodies.
Part of the building is to be found on the National Gallery, but investors do not have its valid consent.
From the written material, however, the owner of the land has only submitted consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not consent to the placement of the building on its lands, the Committee of the Construction Order writes.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta, from the investment firm, the committee of the construction order did not notice the decision of the supervisory authority - the Ministry of Local Development, under which the deadline for the start of the review has already expired.
Anyway, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, respecting all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all relevant authorities and institutions," Razetto said in a press release.
The project that people call a marshmeloun because of the allegedly proposed color of the facade, triggers strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre for a protest against construction in the past.
The associations and residents of nearby homes claim that some permits were issued for a house that had to look different years ago.
They also criticize the failure of buildings for the historic center of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Monastery of Anež.
The house was designed by the architect Zdenék Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted with a glass facade, rejected on the basis of the opinion of the National Monument Institute (NPU), the Ministry of Culture and revoked the permission of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces was approved by the NPÚ and the magistrate monuments, and on this basis construction permits were issued.
The author of the proposal refuses the opponents' withdrawals, he says he never counted with a pink fascist that gave the project a renamed after pink white sugar.
The Czech politicians linked migrants.
The Hungarians also put him in the bass with them.
Berg moved to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the road, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into the car who said they wanted to fly about half a kilometre.
He said that there was no penalty in Hungary at that time, he said in the People’s newspaper.
We knew that the guards of the law did not want such actions.
But when we were arrested by police, they arrested us to our surprise and brought us to the investigative bond in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in politics.
Police said they were behaving correctly, but they were tied to communication because they did not get too well in English.
The prison, however, was sad.
For example, 15 Syrian refugees were killed in our target of dimensions about three times four meters.
There was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were closed the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would be going on with them, Berg said.
What can't be fun anymore?

Metcash launches rural campaign to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and build IGA brands using mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as Dunsborough-based Simmo's offering taste in IGA stores and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware sellers celebrate their annual investment strategic day.
There is a lot in bet because South and West Australia represents nearly 30 percent of the Metcash IGA trading steps and generates higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in eastern countries.
Customers in South and West Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in eastern states.
Anyway, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will pay 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first stores that took over markets from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
In his report this week, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail sales could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million in late 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 stores in the West over the next year and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a fixed price base of Metcash could cost it about $13 million on incomes before taxation, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash lost market share in Eastern states, especially in relation to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Managing Director of the Fund, Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "very likely disappear over decades."
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass’ comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash Board contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA fell from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and the revenue from the Metcash food store, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the development of speculation change as sales and revenue are under pressure.
Nevertheless, the wholesale has moved to the anti-attack and invests more than $150 million a year to deliver stamp prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, thus helping IGA retailers re-equip shops by adding fast-growing food and private news.
Ian Morrice, Executive Director of Metcash, says that the programs for pricing and supplying trades will decline and hope that the great world will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis Supported by Australian Tennis President Steve Healym
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves reputation for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a remarkable loss in the recent story of his friend Nick Kyrgiose and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says Steve Healy, President of Tennis Australia.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented dual often called "Special Ks," attracted an unintentional attention to himself thanks to the afere with unknown Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in a passionate qualification contest in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by arbitrator twice, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka had to take one to Kyrgios and I had to take him too."
While he was last seen breaking the rocket after the crash dropped Richard Gasquet's possible defeat at the US Open, Kokkinakise was unwillingly defending Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a second position behind Bernard Romec in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I was quite intensely thinking that, in my opinion, Thanas was put a bit into the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed the missile when he lost because of a crash in the US, but he's not the first player to get revenge on his missile because of frustration. I know Thanasi well enough, and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he seriously controlled himself very well because he was exposed to a very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around himself, also has a great family around himself, and I think he has been treated a little hard.
It's a very mature 19-year-old man, working very hard and getting into the team great and so on, never had a problem with the other players, in the dress he is very respected, he trains hard, he is in awesome condition, he is very stable and mature young man and I shortly think he deserves to be compassionate according to his own.
Healy also supported the decision to review Kyrgiose for an important match that begins on Friday, and claims that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports the Canberry family to return to the team as a long-term stability.
"We want our team to be fully focused on the game and not on all the controversy around him," Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people show, he has made a few terrible mistakes in public eyes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of my mind, he will be out of my mind.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and retains migrants
Following the announcement of the threat state, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and arrested those who attempted to cross its illegal crossing in order to stop the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and the Serbian authorities reacted rebelliously.
Those who have taken on the bands of the country for an unknown time between the two states stand those who flee from violence in their homeland, build tents and live in their homeland.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When the helicopter is flying over them, migrants are shouting together "Open the borders!" and assigning the Hungarian police units.
Some protesters refused food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect damage.
Over the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Anxiety on the Hungarian-Serb border came a day after the 28-state block did not come with a single immigration policy at the continuing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprised Italy and Greece and talked with hope to reach a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year that EU nations would accept more than 20,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not rely on Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of threat in the two southern regions has given the authorities greater power to address the crisis and has allowed them to close the roads and accelerate judicial cases of asylum proceedings.
In the meantime, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to construct a plot from a rough wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the plot is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News co-ordinator Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped upload the defeated wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other countries from the Middle East.
However, the President of the Government, Viktor Orban, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are looking for better lives and not military refugees who are looking for protection, which is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize the violation of the four-meter plot that the government has left to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establishes longer jail periods for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of threats," said reporters of the government spokeswoman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we are absolutely clear: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, the parliament still needs to approve the army navals that were expected next week, but reporters from Associated Press on the border have observed a severely armed army with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s domestic defense adviser, said the authorities had captured 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 already captured in the state’s territory.
They penetrated by damage to the plot and are now accused of committing crimes under new laws in the police prison.
The authorities promptly let the plot be fixed.
Hungarian authorities also shut down two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a wagon covered with a crushed wire.
At the main border crossing of Roszke, there was a chaos because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing, and the pressures of people emerged.
About 20 of them entered, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked main roads connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
2016 elections: Hillary Clinton's post before Bernie Sanders decreased by half in national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit crash in the Democratic Nomination Race at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders holds her crash.
Clinton is now supporting 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (support from 58 percent), while Sanders is on second place with 27 percent (support from 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has to announce if he wants to be president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clear the decisions they will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News survey, Clinton has lost the ground under the feet of several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton maintains a large gap among women and relieves, but her leadership is pushing.
Her support among men has been significantly reduced and Sanders has only lost 5 points on it.
Clinton’s advantage with Democratic voters under 50 years of age has stepped up, and now they are equal to Sanders.
But Clinton is still a great leader thanks to the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digital crash in front of Sanders among the Liberals, but Sanders now lost only five points in this group.
Approximately half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say they would be excited to support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It is probably not surprising that Clinton’s current abhorrents are particularly insulted because of it.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would be excited to support it.
While 48 percent of the Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiasticly support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favourite Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed that it is time to become a woman (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There is also a great option to choose and agree on problems.
While the Vice-President considers a potential candidate for the president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to lead – a third of them think they should not.
When the primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second election for the nomination of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Between Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden was named their second choice, far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to appoint Democrats, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden will appoint to 30 points without his nomination.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning in general elections; however, this number fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far second at this scale, but the percentage of people who see it as the most likely optional is increasing.
However, when the question of greater importance of the candidate has taken place, democratic voters prefer to solve problems before a greater chance of election.
Like last month, neither a democratic candidate nor a potential candidate represents an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most people see Clinton, Sander and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership quality.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
30 percent of Democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, that is, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have this view.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
As for all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanderse.
As the questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision on using her personal email and server as a state secret, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of it did not affect it at all.
But this is a different story between the American public.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about one-third is satisfied.
The opinions of the public on this subject were divided already in March, shortly after this issue was revealed.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no impact on their overall view of Clinton, while 36% of their view of Clinton has worsened.
It is mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim their opinion on Clinton has worsened.
Although Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among its party voters, this issue is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, which is a decline of eight points last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don’t think they are honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the registered voters across the country also don’t see Trump as honest and reliable.
But Clinton and Trump have good signs of leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best led in honour.
Sanderse sees more people as honest than unfair, but, as with Carson, many voters have not made their opinion on him.
The error range in the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended after Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and others leave support.
Voters from a number of Republicans across the country continue to support Trump with a sharp majority, expanding from 23% of support in the latest CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson leads well across demographic groups, and triggers Trump among university-trained Republican voters.
The remainder of the field, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio John Kasiche, is backwards with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, totally at the disposal of 10% of support, falling to current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all at the third place with 6%.
The error range in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of support among Republicans for 32% of Trump’s support.
A recent survey from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
During Carson’s growing trend, Trump decided to shoot a blind neurosurgeon in service, and even Carson apologised for hearings about Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood members are accused of the death of the first year student Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during the overloading brotherhood ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, he was charged with murder against five people.
The New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Denga during the launch of the ceremonies in September 2013 and late took him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police claim that he had bound eyes, had a bag full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly disturbed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches and then fell into unconsciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Dog Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng smitten, and they were supposed to wait an hour before they took him to the hospital, police say.
Nevertheless, they found time to wear Dengo's dress, take out his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national brotherhood president, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner told the press conference.
"At this point, members began hiding the equipment and essentially preferred brotherhood's well-being from Michael Deng's life," Wagner said.
He failed to live and died the next morning.
According to the petition report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a dirty object in the head, body and stand.
"A lot of families have been forced out as a result of overload in the brothers and sisters and at least one student dies every year from overload since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengo family, wrote in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The Grand Court of Monroe County recommends a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with an attack on overload and criminal association.
"We want to arrest not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or informally, we will be responsible for it as well," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and national brotherhood cancelled their relationship with local branches.
This happens when Fed raises interest rates
Rate growth will come and the market will climb, debt revenues will rise and the economy will decline.
We know all this.
What we don’t know is how long it takes and how long it will take.
In particular, for the economy, the history of a small source of time.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in raising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why U.S. Central Bank officials emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate increases begin, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, the market members can make sure that all rates due to speed increase can be overwhelmed.
"Fede's first rise since the global financial crisis will be inevitablely interpreted by some as the end of the era of cheap money," Julian Jessop, global economist Capital Economics, said in a statement.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to a more common but still low, creating a seismical shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is an overview of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given the market has recorded in the last about a month, the expected increase in rates can make the air slightly unstable.
As soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems there is a trend for the re-stop of shares after 12-24 months after the first rise, which may reflect again the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what would happen after the rise of Fed.
More precisely, the market in the last 35 years often - about 14 percent - is targeted to increase rates in relatively surface rates in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent) and then returns to normal status again after 500 days, Nuve publicity, with the average analysis of the company's non-revenue of Boron from the last six main cycles, according to 14 percent.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares tends to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recession is a real economic life, but increasing rates often help it.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could accelerate the recession.
The most remarkable is that gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history with an increase in Fedu rates.
According to the Deutsche Bank, during the 118th increase in rates since 1950, only twice the nominal inter-annual GDP increase was below 4.5 percent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, it is rarely expected to retain it, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Increasing rates in this complicated economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "when this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were prepared for the growth of Fedu throughout the year and all eyes turned to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting that took place this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve growth in this session, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the rising cycles have been so far in a super rising cycle with GDP covering the beginning of the recession very quickly after the recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is far the longest of the Fed's waiting since the end of the last recession; a record was 35 months, now we're 74 months and we're still continuing.
The solid yield was also volatile, as the market expects an increase in rates and the pattern is slightly similar to what the shares experience.
The main difference is that the impact is faster visible in debt bonds than in shares when the Fed changes the policy direction.
In debt bonds, revenues appear to change the direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the debt increases, debt revenues fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that increase in rates will cause revenues to be closer to long-term and short-term debt bonds, which will equate the curve.
High-income debts often work better in this climate, although "we're still careful about the voltage of income," said Kathy Jones, a firmly-based retirement analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed’s policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs of the market adapting to the prospects of rigorous monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is wider, the credit margin has expanded and volatility has risen - all the market characteristics when the Fed triggers politics.
Generally speaking, companies that carry out most of their business in the United States win after the rise of interest rates and local products become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be worse because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market area and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to be overcome within three months after the initial increase in rates," analysts Goldman Sachsve said in a customer report.
Companies with strong balance sheltered weakened companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital revenue, as well as low volatility supplies, also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high rate of moving interest rate lose the most, Goldman said.
Apart from pure action games, consumers also enjoy thanks to the growing dollar.
Partners can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different opinions about how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Mr. Andrew Bingham
Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "occupation"
He believes that he is becoming more and more unrecognitable than his commercial competitor.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said he was simply deceived by British
Ambassador Damien Collins has attacked a voice and says he is not an original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" in Classic FM, claims a leader and collects fresh pressure on broadcasts to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public service radio station appears to be "occupied" and is increasingly unrecognized than his business competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "occupied" - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appears to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me when you actually just imitate what we already have on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC’s Director-General rejected the allegation by saying that BBC Radio 3 is far from his business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn’t learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live with music and creating music is actually at the top level.
“I also think Radia 3’s commitment to finding new music and putting new works in operation is also very important,” he said.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before because the British are less educated with respect to classical music.
However, Radio 3 wasn't the only element of the BBC production that came under the fire due to the swelling of the business competitors during the broadcasting of Culture, Media and Sports and came to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show purchased by the BBC by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as an unoriginal and how different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which September stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was made "a typical way for the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "found a hit from its own stake" when it starts a fun series next time.
However, he refused to exclude orders from more future series of The Voice or spending money from taxpayers on other formats of entertainment.
Online sales are growing at the slowest rate since August and may be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 saw 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since the beginning of the recording itself in 2000.
Online sales were increased three years ago thanks to mobile purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday may be the cause of braking expenditure
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise, and thanks to it, many British main streets became the city of ghosts.
However, experts argue that there are signs of online selling stability, and new data show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August was the lowest growth since the beginnings of the 2000 measurement, with only 5% rise compared to last year.
Experts argue that there are signs of online sales established, and new data show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the growth level in the past years and go back to 2000, the state has always been rationalized over time,” says IMRG market index editor for Guardian Andy Mulcahy.
It explains that online sales were reinforced three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growing) is slightly stagnating, and therefore it appears to be disproportionate.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was withdrawn from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe customers can stop shopping before this event, which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year, the average of purchasers was five times more than the average of purchasers turned to their computers to organize purchases and at the same time agree a number of seller websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers are contracting again, can keep customers from other purchases
Research published by British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was lost online.
For some products such as television and washing machinery, more than a third of sales are carried out via online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of rabbit fall in Mexico and the family Bin Ladina was sanctioned
29 dead bodies were transferred to the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mexico City
Saudi Arabia is partially blamed for the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the rabbit collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims have gathered to burie 29 victims of the fall of a jerk in the Grand mosque in Mexico. The bodies of the victims were carried on the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, tricky, they chose the way and rejected the honor of the victim when the first of the falling came on his last journey to the cemeteries in Al-Moais.
The sad message walked around the Holy Place, where only a few days earlier the building rabbit threw the ceiling of the mosque and threw himself to the believers.
The body was released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctioned the building group of the family of bin Ladina over a disaster, which also left 394 injured.
29 dead bodies in the Grand Central Mosque in Mexico were carried out on the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was on his first trip when the rabbit collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before starting an annual ride.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hague will take place in Mexico and thousands of people will continue to go down into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not leave the shoulder of a shark up when it wasn't in operation.
The Arabic version of the statement, carried by the state by the Saudi press agency, states that Binladin Group is partially guilty of falling.
The British Disk Agency’s service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s heads were prohibited from traveling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the fall of a jerk into the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims cover in front of the Hadge desert later this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the rabbit and its representatives were not made available for comments.
The Royal statements also accused the group of non-use of the latest security measures and the lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of rabbits are surrounded by the Grand Mosque in Mexico, which is part of the massive construction effort in front of the Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family was near Saudi Arabia’s ruling families for decades and operated large building projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Uzama bin Ladin, was the son of a debris whose family rejected in the nineties.
The crash occurred in the middle of a strong wind and rain just a few days before millions of people were invaded into the kingdom on a journey, which at least once in their lives must be carried out by every Muslim.
According to officials, 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million rials (£174,000) will be devoted to relatives killed, and the same amount for permanent injured.
The other injury will receive half of this amount.
B&Q says East Europe’s traders are working on the left trend
Brits are increasingly employing workers, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the point of growth
The result is that 200 Screwfix stores are open to traders
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Worked by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for Daily Mail
Brits say they are delaying craftsmen and craftsmen and delivering them to employees trained in Eastern Europe to work at home.
If it's about you with a bet or a painter bitch, it seems you're in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employed by retailers to carry out crafts at their home, according to the company's boss at Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns a domestic chain, claims that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores focused on traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Laury says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions make better half.
Currently, most of the workers are male.
She said there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more women's households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says, "We are still working in the shops mostly men.
We need to get closer to the balance.
In essence, half of our customers are women who make 80% decisions about buying goods.
Women play a great role in the decision-making process.
Laury, which is one of the only five women in the cormidal leading companies under the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between men and women’s directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that he has a half-representation of women among employees, including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laury said: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced the decline in profits in half the month and sales after the group took on the cost of closing the trades.
The result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution to retirees is in danger of 600 krones.
"It's justification of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 Vice President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of dignity.
The President of the ODS Members Zbynīk Stanjura noted that the single contribution sounds good, but in the long term it would be better to be in standard values, as it would also move over the next few years.
"We have a space to find a mechanism how we will arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaely Marks (CHR) to be valued over the framework of the law next year.
Marks said she would improve the social situation of pensioners, which is not pink.
A higher value next year would mean the budgetary impact of 5.5 billion krones, and ministers will discuss each billion.
The Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) of the right reminded that in the past the rate of value decreased.
The reporter Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) noted that the proposal would not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
This right of payment in December is significantly complicated and perhaps even impossible, he said.
Consequently, the President of the Members of the Czech Republic, Roman Sklenák, proposed a shortening of the term for the standard negotiation in the Committee for 10 or 20 days, even blocking the right.
The committee will have a month instead of two ordinary.
The bonus should cost a total of $1.73 billion.
The money should be paid in particular from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The pensions should increase in an average of stocks next year.
The contribution should be obtained by people who will be entitled to retire in December or part of it.
They could also get those who had lost their retirement right in December before paying it.
However, they have to ask for an additional fee in writing, and it is later than the end of next year.
In the Czech Republic, pensions are regularly valued by January, with a price rise and a third of real wages rise.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, which should be 40.5 percent next year.
Last year, the state spent $314.7 billion on an old retirement account, which was about five billion a year more.
Elderly pension expenditure represented 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all legal expenditure.
Last year, the average full age pension increased by 104 to 10,714 crowns according to the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration has provided 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17.000 relative pensions.
Jakunin has left plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
The Senate chair, according to Russian media, was almost certain.
In the Council of the Federation, the Western Russian Kaliningrad region was represented by Governor Nikolai Cukanov as a candidate for the United Russia government in the Sunday elections.
According to Russian laws, the senators are not elected by citizens, but they are elected by the governor of three candidates whose names will be announced before the governor's elections.
After the election of the Senate, he chooses from three candidates himself.
It was a complication for Jakun that in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years he did not live as required by law.
However, the Kremlin found an exception for Jakunina, with the exception of being an extraordinary and empowered ambassador to which the lawful requirement for long-term stay does not apply.
The Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger ended.
The last drop in the assumption of the main hero is the voluntary death of his teeth, to which strength and patience came.
Grandma - Iva Janjurova decided on grandfather’s life, age and funeral.
Jan is clear that he and his wife Olgou - Eliška Balzer are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live honestly and freely again.
He seeks to regain government over his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from that so far, he pointed to the story of Slavic.
Bajgar wanted a comedy form to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
Since the beginning, it has been clear that the main role belongs to Bartosh, with whom he has already worked in the Invisible series.
However, he was surprised by an actor who appeared before the camera after a longer break associated with the reconstruction after a serious illness.
We had a deal with him three years ago.
I gave him to read the script and he told him he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me that he was apparently a bubbled athlete.
He always asked where he was going to sit before the show.
This time he walked on a bike, jumped on rocks and even went to the hill.
And all of this in recorded tropical beds, was undertaken by the director.
According to Bartoshsk, women take a tiger to make it a chicken over time.
They will feed him a little bit, but they will immediately close the door, so that he wouldn't have the chance to play outside the tiger.
And we're trying to tell our film about it, commented the actor.
His wife, which may have a slightly negative effect on the viewers, was created by Elisch Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathy and thinks well.
But at the same time, she is a surgeon and wants to stab her husband to death, Bajgar underwent.
The film also resembles the fate of John's married daughter Olivy and Alenky - Táňa Vilhelm and Pavla Beret - and the poems of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
Producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has promised to provide up to $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing to Europe.
It was announced on Google.org on Tuesday, which is the charity of this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled a part of the visit for criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the movement of YES Pavel Telička resigned the trip to Baku on Thursday, because Azerbaijan officially cancelled him today.
Baku, according to Telička, is justified by the last week's EP resolution, which criticizes the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and was co-authored by Telička.
The decision of the Azerbaijan party Telička came to talk with official partners and also to visit political prisoners, depending on the consent of the authorities, explained in a press release his Brussels office.
The journey, which was planned a few months ago, Telička wanted to take advantage of a meeting with parliamentary leadership and executives as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, clarified the text sent by the Czech Republic.
The EP resolution condemns "invisible repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She urged European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent judgment on Azerbaijan's opposition journalist Chadydžou Ismail, who committed himself to revealing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not exclude the construction of its airline base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not exclude the Russian airline base in Syria in the future.
We don't have such plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has an airline base in Syria at Tartus, which has been used as a service and logistics center.
According to reports from the Russian press, but from early August, the supply of Russian weapons and military material to Syria has increased.
According to Moscow, these are armed shippings resulting from applicable trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to set up an air base at the city of Latakia, which remains the base of Syrian President Bashar Asad.
But Washington is not clear about the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria, US commentators agree.
U.S. Foreign Minister John Kerry talked about the situation in Syria with Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday, which was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be issued to Moscow to explain concerns about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The spokesman of the White House, Josh Earnest, signed the support of Assad by Moscow for a feeding bet.
Russia’s political goals in Syria have said they are rather unclear.
Moscow has made its satellite from Syria.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is following a rather long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
According to Russian press speculation today, the war in Syria will be Putin's main theme at the next UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the other hand, the Russian leader is unwilling to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.
According to The New York Times, the U.S. government does not exclude that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian President during the UN meeting.
The opinions of the White House advisers still differ.
Today, the TASS agency, appealing to Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet had a new york meeting with Obama on his schedule.
Sesame oil put on the yellow diet, the canopy helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the addition of beneficial non-saturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When seedling for cold, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, for example, intestines.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, the Czech Republic has been the most common cause for the death of the Czechs for several years.
Gastrointestinal inflammation suffers mainly from women, helps sesame oil.
If you are among the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss sesame oil in the spider, which is part of the original recipes for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the thermal treatment of foods and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in a yellow diet.
Essential fatty acids containing are a good prevention of the formation of yellow stones.
They are 90% of the cause of intestinal inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more frequently than men.
Generally, problems with the bulk are especially related to people with overweight who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can be used successfully even in a liver diet that is very similar to that of the intestine.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that brings the consumption of this oil, they should pay attention to the goods from the exotic food stores.
Asian producers often use grain-free seeds that have a more significant taste.
The oil, however, is about all the active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, CEO of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovska, which produces biological virgin oils in the cold.
The company is also new to produce sesame oil and uses exclusively non-featured seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our liss will be able to get 8 pounds of sesame.
Mechanical grinding the raw material is heated to up to 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for extra virgin labelling.
At higher temperatures, the loss of nutrients would occur.
Sunflower oil benefits in heart and blood diseases.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunshine.
According to research Jarmily Hamerské, who led the Masary University, 43% of respondents preferred it in the hot kitchen.
In fact, it is not suitable for diluting, but it starts to overburn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to store salads and fit especially in a diet, in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 of non-saturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids most reduce cholesterol levels.
In case of heart problems, it is necessary to pay attention to the amount of totally consumed fat and calories.
For example, in one teaspoon of sunshine oil is 62 calories, in a teaspoon of ripe oil is 99 calories.
As for food energy values, it is important to note that natural foods with nutrients are far more suitable than so-called empty calories.
They are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is appropriate to catch extra virgin oils.
The sunshine will last as much as the sesame and the canopy nine months.
With storage in the refrigerator, the durability is extended.
The old oil is known especially by the highest taste.
On the contrary, there is no fraud on the bottom.
It is a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Soap oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical cannabis seeds are classified to so-called superfoods, and so the cannabis oil is considered to be the healthiest of plant oils.
Thanks for this label to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 of non-saturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids are not able to produce the body alone and the person must take them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
Scientists’ studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume it 0.6 grams, on the contrary, Icelandians will take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Soap oil is appropriate to be included in the dining room as part of a supportive diet for strengthening immunity and healing injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is essential in cell membranes.
People do not need to use soup oil to fear, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling ones in the company.
It is sold 500 liters per year.
People often consume one teaspoon in the morning.
Coconut oil is not a tastely significant, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vulček from the Bohemia Oil fragrant company.
According to statistics, they are the most honorable nation of American grillers.
There is 1,4 grids for one home.
Worldwide, there are a variety of gril competitions that are only confirmed by the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives have neglected.
Most of them also grind several times a year.
In order to make grilling successful, we should not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust meat by sealing a few hours before heat adjustment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this, and at the same time leaves a beneficial substance for the health of grilling?
In general, it is necessary to save support in the gril process itself.
Experts agree that much of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oil also comes from the body of the beneficial substances that we otherwise obtain when consuming oils from foods adjusted at lower temperatures.
This does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grinding.
Grapefruit oil for grinding, health and beauty.
When meat is said, Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovska will immediately be equipped with grape oil.
It adds to the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food is characterized.
It is also suitable for cleaning and grinding because it has a high combustion level of up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperatures, as one of the few oils maintains a beneficial substance for the health, it describes the benefits of the grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil company, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this wine rice oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linol acid and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also takes important non-saturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Using grape oil, we also help increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and smooth hair.
The chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold foods, for example, in cooking salads, but also for the thermal adjustment of foods.
When grilling, it can be used in two ways, while marinating and grilling alone.
By marining meat and fish, we preserve their juice.
When preparing marinade, there are three ingredients: oil, acidity and beverage.
For example, we deliver acidity with apple octus and achieve softening of meat.
Rice again supplies meat taste and the oil preserves and delivers the right rice, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is directly ideal for marination because as one of the few oils can pass through dark meat.
So, marinated meat or fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops of them are enough to prepare food.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are a total tabu for this way.
This is especially true of lining, cone and rice oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grinding on your own, spray oil to prevent the burning of food.
The necessary part of the gril is also the preparation of the appendices.
For grilled meat and fish, almost anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, brown bread, light vegetable salad and much more.
Bohemia Oil chefs, for example, recommend hot summer salad.
You need to: • 1 piece of browse • 1 piece of bracelet • 1 glass of wrinkled oak • 1 glass of salad leaves mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bag a mixture of salad leaves with a wrinkled roll, wrinkled peppers and large bowls wrinkled brosh.
Depending on the taste of salmon and pepper, you can also taste a mild chilli and soya juice.
Finally, drink some drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sauce the salad with finely coated mandles.
Stretched sclerosis: it matters not only to drugs, but also to fight the will of the patient.
Disinfected sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs care from a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapeut, ergotherapeut, urologist, oftalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with distressed sclerosis need also consultations if they decide to have a child, care for these ills also includes socially legal advice, recommendations for adjustment of residence, etc.
However, all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he will actively fight with the disease, the longer he can work and has no need to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors warn, the passivity of the sick releases space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been proven that regular movement significantly distants the time when the sick needs some compensation aid, such as a rod.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not undergo different myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads to ending on the car.
This is why the page Dej Chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Dej Chance.
The most important person in care of a sick with scattered sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of scattered sclerosis, it is twice said that the more the disease begins to be treated earlier, the more the doctor can affect something.
This is because we have drugs for spreading sclerosis at an inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong yet.
The sooner we interfere, the greater the hope that the disease will be able to stop and remove disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medova from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with distressed sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often address weaknesses of lower ends or balance disorders.
Patients work according to their individual needs: to maintain condition, improve walking, strengthen the fever, relief of polyurethane disorders, or to improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the patient's specific problems," says MUDr. Martin Kövári, prime minister of rehabilitation and body medicine at the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with split sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it is manifested in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but can always relieve its symptoms.
Movable activity, however, also strengthens the immune condition of the body, which is desirable in the case of scattered sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-esteem.
"During exercise, endorfins are also shipped and a person feels good after it," Dr. Kamila Řasová from the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic of the Royal Vinohrady Faculty Hospital.
By affecting the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these patients were so-called savings, today we know they need targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the Priority of the Rehabilitation Clinic and Body Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The aim of physiotherapy is to enable a person to remain self-dependent as long as possible, including employment classification.
Therefore, physiotherapists work with ergotherapists to ensure that each person receives compensatory help with his ears in peace.
Many patients also need care for a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When you get a serious illness in your life, most people fear it.
They are experiencing shock, panic, fear.
They have to respond to a big burden - loss of health.
With such a distorted soul we have to go behind someone, not to try to get everything out of our own breath.
“I’m working with them to finally conclude that even with disabilities, a full-life can be lived and that split sclerosis does not mean the end of life,” says psychotherapeut Renata Malin Schubert from the Neurology Clinic at the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses wouldn’t fly.
Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or lightweight and solid composite materials that no one can produce and process immediately.
Nevertheless, alongside superaccurate computer-controlled processing machines, alongside autoclaves for the formation of composites can be hit on something as usual such as mercury pecks.
In the bubble, which resembles a sugar vatus bowl, the edges of plate parts that just came out of the freaking machine are sent in the assembly.
"No one has done anything better yet," says Ivan Dubsky, director general of the air door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the Prague Summer Area, the former Flight produces a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world, they supply the doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors whose part is built in Prague also enter the first and higher-class passengers on the top boards of the world’s largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner is also equipped with a composite door.
The accuracy is the main motto here.
Maybe the momentum keys let the company adjust twice a year.
If a check record is missing on the yellow label, they should explain to Airbus or Boeing’s auditors who travel regularly to see if the doors are made in accordance with the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not replaced human senses yet.
On one door to the A320 there are 1,500 nuts.
The nickers have to screw hands.
It takes them two days.
The sound of the sound that sounds will know if the sound is not sounded properly.
The tolerance in which they are moving is minimal.
The neck can reach the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 mm.
It is about twice the thickness of human hair.
When checking, there will be a number of trained bulbs.
When the controller goes through a number of nuts, he knows if someone is out of tolerance.
Then take the precise screw meter in your hand.
Flight was fed in 1989 by the L-39 Military Exercise Plan.
However, in 1991 no one was produced.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
He joined the European Airbus aircraft manufacturer.
She won an emergency door supplier selection for the A321 model.
The conversations with Boeing weren’t so happy.
“We were a small company for them that had no money enough to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable delivery,” Dubsky said.
The door to the U.S. manufacturer would remain unforgettable if Letov did not attend the conference of the International Aviation Association in Prague in 1999, the French Latecoere Group.
I talked about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day, the negotiations with France were separated, Dubsky said.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with the strong company.
In 2000, the installation of the door parts for the A320 was separated.
Three years later, the A380’s top doors arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for composite processing due to deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have made these big contracts alone.
Maybe we'd make some pieces or small parts.
Partners want a warranty of delivery for twenty or thirty years, Dubsky explains.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere reached the turnover of over 2.9 billion and profits after taxing 147 million krones.
The exclusive position between aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion krone in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special manufacturing processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn’t produce any doors to the aircraft.
Get certificates that manufacturing processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated checks, keep them worth millions of dollars in Dubai.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to educate employees, provide equipment and re-certificate the entire process, adds Dubsky.
Now the company completes the preparation process for coating with zinc and nickel, which will replace the current harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the entry from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt to the technology for equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from the Boeing will come and check the concept of the entire line.
Then we will present the production to them.
We also check our laboratory.
One set of samples test themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results to ours, approaching the way the customer controls them.
The prize is a long-term exclusive contract to the Prague company.
With the Prague race today, the production of embracers is falling and falling.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacement of Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complicated for Brazilian or European manufacturers.
It doesn’t mean he could say any price at the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It tells you how much one door will cost in ten, fifty, and the pieces made.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We need to get into this price model.
If not, we're going to work, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M are integrated, is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic line for newing and installation of doors for the innovative model A320 Neo is built here.
Initiation will be accelerated and clear.
"This is the trend that the airline mount is pushing," adds Dubsky.
The future line is secured.
Airbus announced that the airlines have ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320.
Only a few meters next to the A380 line will be formed for the complete assembly of the doors.
It is a strategic decision of our mother company.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, Dubsky says.
However, before that, the company has to pass qualifying tests necessary for mounting some electrical and electronic devices to the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also waging on the further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, the new Airbus A350 program will also compete with the American Dreamline.
“This is a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials,” Dubsky proudly says.
Latecoere, however, is available at the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In the Letov Area, where he lives, there is no more place.
Before the arrival of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
It is now 800 and within three years it may be more than one hundred.
As long as Airbus and Boeing will prevent the number of hundreds of new airlines ordering each year, they may not be afraid of work.
Although it has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague Latecoere has faced a threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to pay the loans.
Finally, Latecoere was able to deal with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors gained a 37.4 percent share in the company by increasing their capital by EUR 57.4 million.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, i.e. EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company upset new shares among existing shareholders for €222.9 million.
In total, it raised the basic capital of €280 million.
The entire group enjoys the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which share 85 percent in markets.
The average growth of contracts is expected to reach 4 percent per year by 2017.
The book has orders of 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four-year production.
The French media claim that Latecoere can finally get rid of the jackets after years.
The Czech race in the Prague Summers is important for the groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the markets.
According to the number of employees, the largest foreign branch is the group.
MEPs have supported a larger share of the state from coal fees.
The change in the mining fees is expected to bring to the state treasury of Rs 427 million more than in 2013.
According to the government, the municipality's budget revenue must have a neutral impact, as the fee must be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
From the brown coal mining, there were about 200 million crowns in the municipality and 66 million crowns in the state.
Novela also calculates the increase in compensation from residential premises with permitted mining to a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments continues to be fully belonging to the municipality.
Minister of Industry, Jan Mladek, told Members of the Czech Republic that the municipalities receive 14 million to 100 million crowns annually.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law but by the government by its regulations.
Recompense shall be calculated as a component of the amount of the extracted injury and the rates for each injury species.
According to the government, the reason for change is, among other things, the possibility of flexible response to the current economic situation.
Mr Marek Benda warned, however, that imposing a fee by government regulation may not be in line with the Constitution.
However, according to the Minister of Youth, there is no taxation in this case, because the State is paying for the growth that is a state asset.
The fees are received only by municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, they will receive three quarters of the money of the municipality and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive horn mining.
The part of the money that you are paying on the mining fees will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a rescue service.
The proposal has been criticized by opposition deputies who have claimed in particular that it will harm municipalities affected by mining and countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostové) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they are still because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions only in order to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in Auschwitz.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mostecka, Ms Hana Aulická was warned by KSČM.
Kadner and Aulikia failed to propose to reject the novel, and Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to contribute.
The reasonable report states that mining companies say that the increase in fees will not turn into coal prices, as prices are over 90 percent long-term agreements.
Therefore, main consumers such as power plants or heaters should not feel price rise.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will increase wages to compensate for an effort to reduce their operating expenses, which would mainly mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government said.
However, it believes that increased fees in terms of employment is profitable.
According to the rapporteur's Milan Urban novel, it is essential that Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, government decisions on coal mining limits before adoption of the law.
If coal is also benefited by limits, then it will have impacts on incomes for both the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Youth in the fact that the decision to break the limit down the Czechoslovakia army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of ČSA should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the United States Federal Reserve
The world watches how the U.S. Federal Reserve will meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists from Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make decisions now think they would remain inactive for a while and leave interest rates within 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event because the seat has been spent years since the Fed had lowered rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero layer and start the normalization process of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, the head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy led quite well, a recovery in the form of adding trillion dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for rise, but the circumstances indicate that they also see great chances against this step.
The decision shall be announced on Thursday at 20:00 PM.
Shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day with his colleague - wrote a message claiming that he was " sorry" for the first murder and that he wanted to take it back, revealed on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called police on Monday morning at 10 a.m.
He said he shot someone.
Lamb's officer asked him to send a police officer to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and also mentioned that there is a "delicious dog" in the house, "who won't bother anyone," but he's upset.
Police asked for the names of the caller, but Lamb did not present himself.
Lamb didn't even explain why he was shot in the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, the 41-year-old Amy Prentiss’ body found a handwritten message from Lamba: “I am so sorry and I wish I could get it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb went on a 300 miles long road to Delta University, where he killed the historian teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
William LaForge said he didn’t know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “something was apparently happening in Mr. Lamba’s head.”
Despite Monday’s statement that Lamb believed in the romantic relationship with Amy Prentiss, the government officials said that there is no “proof of the mercy triangle.”
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for seven years, said she was a “great person.”
The divorce occurred 15 years ago, but both of them remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was the whole case of "threated".
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were “the best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss’ close friend, Sun Herald said, Prentiss worked from home via the internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunter dog named Blesk, walked with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to jail.
When the police reached him on the road near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped and fled to the forest where he shot himself.
According to a lifespan published on the school’s website, Lamb obtained a doctoral degree in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that lost their magic
The actor (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.
The actor was also allegedly having a drug problem and was arrested in 2008.
All of these things are definitely choosing their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be playing for several months due to a double breakdown.
Luke Shaw suffered a double breakdown of his right leg during the Manchester United defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this injury in tears and expelled him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Hector Moren was injured in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV space.
Nine minutes were treated on the ground floor and oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg break and now he's in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 it's very difficult, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in his clothes, he also had a planted oxygen mask.
Poster.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg break will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group phase.
I think he's still playing this season.
Moreno had a lot of luck to haven't had a red card and a penalty headquarters.
The judge Nicola Rizzoli did not charge Mexican.
Van Gall pointed out that the Italian arbitrator was wrong.
You can decide whether it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a very harsh action on both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you for their messages, words can't be expressed as I'm destroyed, my journey to recovery starts now and I'm going back even stronger."
Manchaster United records Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France in July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It was a very harsh injury."
When any player leaves the playground with such injury, everyone is very sad about it.
The goal of our players is never to injure the players.
Moreno suffered a break of legs in the match against Van Gaalov Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and if you hear about the severity of such a injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I couldn't see that moment.
I only saw a ball that was going in another direction, so it seemed to have touched him, but I didn't see the action on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after the intervention of Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child loves a book, it does not take long before he learns to remember it.
You shouldn't be David Cameron.
On a question from the child scheme providers to name the favorite child book, he chose the president of the Government of Lorax, a 1971 story by Dr. Seusse.
It was difficult to choose, writes Cameron in a report published on SuperCamps' website, and continues: "It's funny, impressive, creative and with strong content, I liked to read that kind of read to my children because it always has a picture or a message I've never seen before."
Well, only after Cameron in the following paragraph allegedly described the story of the book according to the 2012 film elevator, which added additional characters and details to fill out a short original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville promised walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes he will get the heart of his girlfriend's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree in 1991," is a short content of the book, Thesdor's name was true.
James himself wasn't quite suspicious, the text provided by Cameron is read as a summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air of your children gets the commodity, the boy's name.
Since he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the story of a book, where the most nominated young man learns that the local nature is devastating the castle, the trees of the once-ler industrialist, who despite the protests of the title of Loraxe, a screaming, crafty creature that "speaking for the tree."
It is most likely that a relatively significant PR task was received by an assistant who had never read Lorax to the child 20 times in a pocket.
Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was the most written from Cameron’s opponent’s office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without any further comments.
Adam Lyth was in danger of England's negligence, but still holds
Competition with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England chose for this tournament, I think it will be unlikely to repeat the 3-0 defeat that she suffered in the previous test series.
I wouldn’t even exclude the winning of guests.
Alastaira Cook’s side may be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin players in this burning system and also collective thinking is strong; they will not hold their 2012 jewels, only youth positive.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although he is unknown at the level of the test series, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth went out of England's team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is for me a hard rush to analyze because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are judged based on performance.
For example, there were no questionnaires around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and this I’ve mentioned before — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century years and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own fate.
Hopefully, when he gets more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
Trevor Bayliss, England’s chief coach, praised his position, although his performance was not 100%, and it doesn’t surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how long the testing time will be given to the brush to appear is a hard oak.
Lyth received seven chips — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton was nine.
Compton only got the chances at home and outside.
The only thing you can remedy is that England gave Jonathan Trott the first chance in the Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this frozen opportunity is already the past.
Alex Hales is coming and it's a burner that I appreciate very positively.
It's an x-factory cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge Square, which made a little like that.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will, of course, depend on the overall structure of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts by Cook's side, who would get another spinner while keeping four quicks, was overwhelmed and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't fire and this left-wing man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his work for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and there is no big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
He did it for three centuries and did not even look at it.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, I was interested as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his hard statistics — on average 31 with a ball and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a prams, but there are no many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors decided for the youth.
Many will learn about this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart supplements to their coach staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lanka coach, as a test match consultant may be a masterpiece.
He is one of the most beautiful players who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives in the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and unpleasantness.
I always felt he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and as Mahela has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dress, although they are voices that say consistent things that have been spoken earlier, can sometimes relieve and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly's co-player Durham Ben Stokes received a one-day vacation as well as Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many do not agree, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you need to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken to light weight.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy begins to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's unthinkable renegotiation strategy to maintain Britain in the EU reaches further problems with each last day, even without the choice of a genius Jeremy "Is that Yes or Not?" Corbyn in the Head of the Working Party, or TUC will take on Tuesday to parite the situation around Europe.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat has recently explained how Europe is going to crash in various crises - not all of which are their faults - some Member States have enough British egocentric agendas, shared concessions and disturbing changes to the treaty that mostly they did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they would not want it even if they found social protection.
We can even call it selfie agenda for Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolitans, take a picture of the famous local monument, with or without local rankings, and then return home with words to win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants an independent UK in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - indicates that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German cleverly balanced Chancellor, is an ally, but she was in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes a bad one for her, as it was with the long-term Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16 years).
French François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also falls.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left side.
It’s hard to see how you love your legs with helping Selfie Brits who could better invest their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan intentionally unused SNP style notes during a 2017 referendum campaign in the UK to accelerate the Brexit process, a friend said.
"Renegotiations solved the problem" and "British has nothing worth negotiations."
The Europeans know for their own injury how much Fleet Street can be and how skeptical against the EU are the press barons of oligarch because they were not during the 1975 Tony Ben-inspired referendum, which supported our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, a shocking Euro-portunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his anger, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of non-payable taxes, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo-office departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you are in the cave with a shiny gourmet, you have to throw her bananas so that you don't get to dinner and then to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair accepted the principle of the abolished EU constitution, which was flooded by French and Dutch voters in 2005, and received him a card for the vote.
The press has never forgiven him.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who friendlyly cried me on Monday at Westminster, told him that no longer should waste time on me, seems to be in danger of re-accepting the boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake at the time.
It may take a while, but it needs to develop a coherent media involvement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose chair left the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is developing, I am glad to say.
He argues that he wants to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's devastating trend and the wild coast of Tory's little Englandism can definitely join it.
The same thing Hilary said "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his internal skate couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appropriate McDonnell's appointment as a Shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
The Hillary game was much more attractive.
But fighting for staying "in all circumstances" - Bennina's phrase - wasn't what McDonnell said, or what JC said to his colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whether it's a background, a sensitive image that Corbyn wants to tell - don't forget, touched me - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of the day-to-day television broadcasting and especially in the faith, the burden of paranoia and the betrayals that social media are
It is fair not to provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Working Party in a referendum campaign, of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins is sure to think of it.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic cruise on membership in the EU - in accordance with their Bennite-woven economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion between the left-wing dissidents, for which narcism is the central essence of dogmatic harassment.
As with his excruciation about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign won't want to end it - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of everything for their home lords.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British "small military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of the conservative government at power, as I was recalled at the launch of something called the British Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize review of electronics published by Public Health England
A government-funded statement that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, rise from a meeting of 12 people, some of which are linked to the tobacco industry, researchers say.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet to criticize the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published a "monthly" report last month and described it as a "complex review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the scope of data and emphasized the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
Lancet, a leader in the professional magazine last month, attacked a "extraordinary chatter base" on which the PHE founded its main conclusions.
Two other experts who wrote for BMJ questioned the claim, which was allegedly "based on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They hope that the public could expect the PHE’s claim, which sounds “the best estimated current is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking,” are based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people called for a multi-criter decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their opinions on damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell argued that one sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General was previously claimed to have received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the BAT public health award in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 participants admitted financing from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the financing that he claimed to have received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known electronic cigarette champions, some of which also declare industrial financing in newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting also took part in tobacco management.
The report is created in this group "excluding," missing "hard evidence of harmfulness to most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," it was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claim in BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the lifelong smokers will die due to their dependence.
All evidence indicates that the health risks presented by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to explore the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows, and also what they do not show, especially when there was so much public disturbance about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die from smoking and smoking diseases per year cost NHS £2 billion per year.
With a clear emphasis on current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not at risk, we are carrying only a breakdown of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfill our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, said former Director Channel 4
Former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should be used only for programs that are not composed of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for implementing public services programs that will likely be watched by only a doll of people in complex broadcast times compared to his rivals "the largest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he failed to try to connect with the BBC for six years working on Channel 4.
"I fight with the idea that the BBC will introduce and broadcast programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said at the Commission for Communication in the Upper House, as part of the BBC's negotiations on the future.
If you keep licensing fees that I am not sure whether they are a good idea in the medium- or long-term horizon, the creation of programs that others don’t produce or don’t give should be reduced.
They are broadcasting The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get as widely as possible support for the future.
The idea that nobody else would send him is a ridiculous joke, and of course irrelevant.
Johnson said, “I don’t understand why regressive tax should support programs that can be funded freely.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on domestic soil.
Sincerely, other channels would give them a quiet right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at least.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by enhancing ratings "for the ambitious people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to provide long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those that former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC sells the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more sharp public service programs of the BBC "transmits to the BBC4, where quite often they can't measure dignity, but fulfill their powers and can argue when they are ready to justify their covering mission of £4bn income from license fees, "But of course, we do not do all these abominations."
They are broadcast at a time when no one looks at them.
As regards the licensing fee, Johnson said to the Commission, “I ask you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds are a big sum per year, but for people for whom 150 pounds are a lot, I would be amazed if they would pay so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its rhetoric mission in the sense of "informing, educating and enjoying."
He confirmed that a small volume of production of BBC has already been classified as educational – it was 1% of television production and 0.1% in radio – and should take as a sample of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to “inform, explain and enjoy.”
On the theme of the partnership Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast on television only a snake, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or controlling brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction that the bulbs move.
Scientists have grown bulbs with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small flashlights change direction at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses that are inherent for human ears.
Pulses function by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists have stated that these rabbits are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and is activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the patient's brain is inserted electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used for example to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The liquids usually do not react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction will come when placed into the liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles reinforce ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of the bulbs.
Increased ultrasound waves act in TRP-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of some nuts cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate cells to which they are associated, the journal Nature Communications reports.
In order to be able to control glues using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the bulbs by containing some of their motor neurons containing TRP-4 ion channels.
After using such a modified ultrasound towers, the sound waves were reinforced by microbulls and moved to towers where modified motor neurons were activated.
The new method is similar to optogenetics in many ways, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to activate and turn off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, said that sonogenetics could have many advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without limitations and be sent directly into the brain.
"We believe that when we use genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that his application would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Unlawful torture equipment - right on your threshold!
An advertisement that leaves the British arms trade.
Take a look at the Amnesty International anti-arm market video.
Dangerous killing drones!
Feelings on the legs that love cats!
Shoots! Shoots!
And electric rounding pockets that cause intolerant pain, but leave no traces!
A joyful voice and a metaphor are not in doubt that this advertising on the world's largest arms storms is an acute parodie created for Amnesty International for emphasizing the UK government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through defense and security facilities at International Veselice at ExCeL Centre in London, London.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the blowing of posters on bus stops and metres that require a second view.
"The Important Notifications, Traveling on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using a letter with a London Metro mark with DLR lines becomes a tank image.
In September this year, the birth of arms traders will descend on the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop arms trade.
The 300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismalandu.
The Special Patrol Group has helped distribute them across London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen keys, which claims to have access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet.
Transport for London is not enjoyed by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the collective Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator Cruel Designs and Professional Assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and attempting to demonstrate political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists move to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the trade with guns of health passengers in the metro.
Video Amnesty was viewed by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP who worked free of charge and graphic designer and commentator also worked free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the quiet advertising around arms trade - he saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that's trying to avoid."
They played with the creation of more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "adding strained colors and animation, I felt that it was getting more people."
“They gave a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the wholesale,” says Tom Davies, Amnesty.
What we need now is that the UK government takes measures and ensures that it does not illegally trade the torture equipment on our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding arms shop comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemist products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army on "on the army of fire AT4CS RS."
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects outside arming within the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life on Student Colleges
11 years ago, I moved to colleges as an invisible nineteen-year-old boy, still believing in bars and moral relativism, but so far I am enjoying the tense smiles of those with whom I practiced - and numerous, long-lasting complaints of others.
Everything I learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
Moving to the rail can move from slightly to the nerves that go to totally tremendous.
It’s attractive to blame: tell people where you’re from, if you’ve taken a year of break, what you think of Corbyn, and why “you really don’t love Marmite or just hate it, because people, it’s just an extraction from the HAHA cupcakes, I’ll be in the room.”
He breathes deeply.
And help others to breathe as well - ask yourself and express interest.
It guides conversations and helps you find the people you like, and those you wouldn't have fun with, even if your stripes were in one fire, and they'd issue the hotspots.
Let people have room.
People's rooms are often changed to a drinking reception, film dinner and municipal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and adjust the lower clothes.
Related: Don’t even think you’d start going to college and be in a relationship at the same time
Introverts will come shortly.
Your room should be a refuge, however, many railroads are changing into an outdoor walk culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It can be a hell for someone who needs to load.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when the co-worker is tired of socialization - and perhaps write to him instead of locking.
When it comes to climbing: climbing.
One guy in my wheels had the habit that if the doors were not locked, he was invited into.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to the dishes.
Because you started going to the university at the top of the barbecue mania, locking outside the door and showing with a dressed cake looks less strange, less than "Well, welcome to the neighbourhood, something I've waited for you, smile now while I'm asking personal questions."
Offering a home funeral is a good way to find friends.
Your companions will feel obligated to talk to you and maybe everything ends by assigning your face to a delicious surprise.
Of course, this is the subject of being a decent pecker.
Badly condensed pieces of mosquito, sugar and juice will likely guarantee that others will pre-sleep when you try to climb them at the door.
Theft of food is a common crime on student railroads.
Theft of a whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea thieves?
Check it twice with the milk owner.
There is a chance that milk will be offered to you even when they're bleeding inside.
If someone steals something to you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my co-habitant, who exchanged her milk for a wash machine to punish the thieves.
Now he's in jail.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleep or study.
It is not only about being a decent human being, but you are also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my hall asked her neighbors if they could quiet a little drum and bass because they were 3 in the night and had a song in the morning.
Their answer was to strengthen music.
When they finally quiet at 5am in the morning, she left them to sleep for two hours and then left her own music locked the door and went to her three-hour song.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future would go on the same trains as you?
And, on the contrary, wouldn't it be tremendous if you'd crash co-habitants behind your future going, sleep together, separated, and had to see each day, and maybe take control of your fellow friends?
Of course, you don’t let your heart go – but if your sexy cohabitant isn’t your future, try at least a little to talk to your weaknesses.
At a recurring moment, when you realize that someone has left the keys in his unlocked room, there is only a thin boundary between laughter and shit.
A good jerk is funny, but easy to fix.
Learn them valuable and fun lessons about their security by hiding something to them - never destroy someone’s room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Close them the door and put them the keys into a bottle of water that you then put into the fridge - but never put their items on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins, despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eve has experienced cruel moments already in pregnancy with the seven-year-old Vittem.
His father went with her, and her offspring was alone for preparation and education.
The situation came up with me relatively quickly - I was very looking forward to the child and looking for positive in that.
Uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to hurt myself.
And I certainly had the hope of not staying alone for a long time, today, Eve remembers her first pregnancy.
She already met on the internet at the chat of an elderly Wake, with whom they began to talk about her favorite movies.
Eve and Vitkem even brought home from their birth, but he didn’t take too much to the role of their own father.
"For a while, he then dropped out of the program," Eva described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The motive of the third series of Czech television is to seek happiness for a second attempt.
Congratulations and family financial security managed through part-time work and great help from Mom and the help of aunt.
In the end, the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child did not end up injuring Vasco’s inclination to Eve.
They definitively came together around the Second Happy Birthdays, and he now understands yours as his father, and he also speaks of it.
Although Vasko already has two adult daughters, fatherhood in the age of sixty enjoys, according to his words, and is more devoted to children.
In addition to the two-year-old Leontynka and finally the two-year-old Leontynka arrived.
"The washing has entered our family in such a way naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother has never spoken too much to me in relationships," she smiles.
A little place?
At least we're close.
The couples Ema and Ela were born by the Emperor's cut after Eve was diagnosed with a pregnancy cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of membrane, which then occurs in excessive amounts in the blood of pregnant women and manifests in particular by swelling.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fruit, which is threatened by premature birth and death, in the mothers after childbirth, mostly self-individual.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evina and Vasko, even though they were only in the 36th week.
Emily was placed in the incubator at the intermediate department, where she worked as well as Vachkov's nephew, who was able to take her and stay.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after transporting from JIP to room I had it with me, she describes the challenging period after the birth of Eva.
He spent twenty days in his childhood until the doctors chose to release a baby, which was in the meantime able to reach the limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the birth of children in Eve’s family did not make it.
"I was crazy by the same way after my husband and children," she reminds me of the difficult moments at the six-month department four times.
She and her husband also thought of signing the reverse, among other things because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
After all, the doctors let Eve and the twins go to the home care.
The four stories of pregnancy and childbirth will be broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
The whole family can be honest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to expose herself to an electric two-bedroom and pressured conditions.
The house has not grown, but Yourk has made Eve happy with the installation of a gas vacuum cleaner to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
When it's worse, we'll change the taxi.
Eva is convinced that children particularly perceive family wellness and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size of the house or the dirt.
So far we've been very nice, better than we expected.
However, the disorder is worse hiding in a small space, and we sometimes cross the baby, but at least we are all nearby, Eve smiles, which can find a positive side in every situation.
The work of the lighter in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
Sometimes they go to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, how long can family and children take care of the finance, according to their words, be physically able to do so?
“I realize that because of our age difference, I will be the one who will live this family once,” Eve admits at the level asking for the future.
She would like to go back to work, but she's even more interested in her own business.
With four children, I'm not just an employer's field.
And when it's worst, my husband and I can change a taxi, a sympathetic blonde.
Apple didn't have an effect.
There are displays behind everything.
The more powerful processor, a larger resolution camera, a faster shades or a touch-recognising display, are in favour of the newly introduced nine-generation iPhones.
The last two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend was that every new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
The difference between two grams of weight in the unprofitableness of the news was, at the same time, really negligible.
This is not true for new iPhones.
Compared to last iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams in the smaller model, and by 20 grams in the larger model.
On the one hand, it can’t be surprised that the last aperture in Apple’s pockets has been swallowed significantly.
The press is also made of a more resistant 7000 aluminum alloy, which has also spread to the weight.
But they have a much greater impact on it.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology for the news, allowing the display to distinguish the power of touch.
To do this, the display was required to provide another layer of capacitive sensors.
The mass of new iPhone displays has increased more than twice compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams per 29 grams, then for the bigger from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest component.
The weights of only 143 grams are then achieved in this news thanks to the sharpening curve that has affected most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, it is then the hardest part of the battery, but its weight has never changed compared to the predecessors.
Even in this case, the greatest increase is visible in the display.
The 5.5" weight of the iPhone 6s Plus reaches 192 grams.
How much new display technology will be practical, it will only be displayed when using.
First users will be able to try this on Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Do you have a cup of champions breakfast for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists were able to find an interesting possibility.
They discovered traces of settlement by a modern man from various times, including wall paintings, residues of instruments, and so on.
In the 23A layer, which according to tools dated up to time about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that is very reminiscent of the rest of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, there have been traces of sheep’s grain, which apparently passed through the production process today’s so popular flour.
With it, the grain is first wet today, then dry, then get rid of the packaging, so-called plunge, then sleeps and splits on the plate.
In the cave of Paglicci, the grain was found, according to all, heated or burned, and then apparently scattered between two milestone stones - at least the traces of use on two stones in the cave.
So, in their publication for the PNAS magazine, scientists have not been able to prove that the entire process of fiber production would be carried out in the cave, but the similarity is really very obvious.
We also have no proof of how the people of the flocks could eat, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and perhaps even quite warm, of course, it is quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intense people used grain for a long time before the creation of agriculture.
If the interpretation of the wolves is correct, the oldest wolves have been agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New station reporting in Transport company Brno City.
So I once again listened to reporting the names of stops in the trolley bus: Hnusáčkova, Prizrak, Frazova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was slightly noisy, so male voice reporting was slightly less understandable than before when stops were reported with female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is more discernible than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that the voters chose the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose it from the studio recordings taken in total silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the bus engine frame.
I've lived in Brno for a few decades, so I know the right names of all these stops, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who don't know themselves in Brno and who are mostly intended for this report can be confused and can be reported to the final where they had to be wrong, then the one who came out is to say that it was not.
Perhaps that voter choice - but better again the voter - should be done again, and this time undercovered by the normal transport noise and racing of the engine, in which the speaker's crash in the bus almost loses.
So we don't have to listen to the names of the water stations of Hershpice, Smirrov, or then Ponorná in the sharp ride that I moved to in Komarov.
I suppose that my ageing hearing hasn't worsened so much at a time during the only day the voter had changed the stop.
Before that day, I understood these reports quite well.
Good morning, co-chairman.
From the track records.
Today, few people already know what the biggest and most intelligent governments of the party were so-called comprehensive checks.
I let you remember that.
The bus was late.
I hit the office at a time when the radio sounded like it was just seven hours.
"You're lucky that you didn't meet with your boss, came a minute before you and seemed to have no mood right," he said while registering in the book of arrivals.
Thank you, I'm a little bitch.
Write me that I'm going to check out the small mechanics.
It won't work, today's checks.
They're all fucking scary.
What's it about?
"You'll see it," he shouted.
You'll be next time too.
I went to the walk.
Then the headquarters opened the door and the headquarters appeared.
In a perfectly falling identical way, with a stone face.
"Good morning, sir," I greeted honestly and quickly turned on two buttons of the word at the same time.
"Good morning," the reply sounded, and I quickly went to the second floor, without realizing the cold, malicious tone that the old man answered.
"You're playing," said the engineer Eva, the older lady I appreciated.
She said she was even a boss before her companions settled her.
They're checks, and you're coming here.
How many times I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they're once every three years, they all have to be with them, and that's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
But he says I'll see it.
I pulled out of the fucking fascicle with periodic reports and that's the phone.
"Here's Holcman, come to me right now," said the chief voice.
What's poisoning?
Now we met and nothing ..." I missed, but no one answered me, everyone just with their own thoughts.
"Good day, co-worker, I've come to your order," I sneered, I kidneyed into the headquarters.
The boss sat behind the writing table and browsed some leaflet.
"A friend of the mechanic," he said for a moment, without lifting up his head and still watching it carefully, "I don't like your behaviour at all."
He picked up the camp on the table, wrapped into the seat of the chair, and jumped up on me with a usual, uncomfortable, bad, pillow look.
I've lost it.
What's going on?
Yesterday, he praised me that I worked very well in the last few months and that he was pleased with me.
That the boss did very well when he pulled me out of the front at a distance.
What about this?
You know, you're a train distance technician, and you've got to behave.
The greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I cried out that I used such a greeting since I was a child, that I was so educated and that I don’t see anything wrong in it.
It was like a red shaft on the head.
"You're on a socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work," the chief executive said.
And, in addition, you still pledge the terms of the supervisors.
You're going to say "Sir" once and again "Judge".
But I'm not a master for you, but a co-chairman.
The mayors are the co-workers, the top trams are the top trams!
Remember that for a good time!
I'm sorry, sir... co-chairman, but... but I greeted you with the ordinary civilian greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's a honor of work, or a friend... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," said the boss a little calm down in the meantime.
But it will still be talk about it.
Anyway, remember that you don't have to retire the chairs up there.
It wasn't good.
When the boss told someone that something was not his preference, it didn’t seem good with the person concerned.
I was looking for words that I would answer for a while.
I was too embarrassed for his uplifted stitching.
He was only a few years old and played a masterpiece, actually a co-worker.
It's arrogant, sophisticated, authoritarian, arrogant, as it's right now.
Everyone was kicked out for him.
Wake up, he's the boss.
In fact, not everyone, the president of the party organization, like all the strangers, but even the non-partisans, was ticking him.
But the commander was struggling with many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
Right now, he shot me for a whole cow.
I thought about a bit of shit, and it'd cost me a lot of shit so I couldn't shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to the knife until I'd continue to work as an awful officer.
What would I like to enjoy with two kids?
And for that, a sharp bark!
I was in trouble, but I managed.
I can't make him happy.
"That's all so far, you can go," the head of the audience ended, and began to re-explore the camp that he had in his hand before.
They called me at half a half.
All of the offices were there and asked what and how, they answered that yes, that it would be fine.
Just Jogin told his former habit that they couldn't throw us all out, because the co-chairman should do this work himself with his faithful ones, and that doesn't risk it.
He emphasized the word “smart” as if he knew what the old man shot for me in the morning.
There was a nice crash in the headquarters.
A joint head behind his writing table and at the long advisory table another co-worker who had to decide on my official being or not being.
Kadrovák, President ROH, a staff recorder, a reporter for special purposes, something in a way that contradicts the military, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the president of the party organization.
I knew him out of the stairs.
The usual trail worker, undercovered a trail or wrapped a trail.
But also the former bachelor.
He was asked that there was no fun with him that time, says a beautiful beast.
The bad languages argued that he went out of school in the seventh grade, had nothing to learn, had nothing to do.
And when the criminal was cancelled, he ended up shooting at a knife.
But the co-worker, yes, the co-worker was crushed!
The Chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a small sodium in me, a non-combinable shark in my neck.
Kadrovák read a decision from the civilian committee from the place of residence.
I am from a working family, I am married, two children, and so on.
So far it's good, I thought, and I've breathed a little better.
The decision of the party's street organization.
He copied the decision from the Civil Committee, maybe both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of the party for many years refused to submit themselves to the verification committee and then resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The boss looked closely at me.
The doctor noticed it and stopped reading.
The boss ordered him to continue.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and there I was acquired as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I married and I had a wedding in addition to the National Committee.
I disappointed the party’s confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was expelled from a number of her candidates.
But that's not enough!
I let both children be baptized, and even my mother, when she died, fixed a church funeral, although it was a former party member.
This is all about the negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cathedral read, only the drawing of the master’s shirt into the table stopped the tensioned silence.
Everyone looked straight at me and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
I constantly repeated in the spirit, "Communists - superhumans, Communists - superhumans." What did I get to?
Why wouldn't I have stayed at the cowboys?
I could even fix the moves without any fucking checks.
But now?
The career of an enthusiastic officer took her for her before she started.
Go back to the sheet?
I'm sure it won't work, the boss will take me for an hour.
"Friend, how have you checked the co-worker here?" said the head quietly, asking the narcotics.
Well, according to the judgment from the previous job.
You got him here?
It was obviously not too often.
At the hiding of the bow, he nervously crushed as if he were self-verified.
He swept and gave a paper to the boss.
"No," said the chief, with a sign of groovyness, which was often a pre-claim of the storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, trained with honor, graduated from industry, worked in a task wage as a counterpart, fulfilled the norm on average to a hundred and twenty percent.
But that's essential.
Where did you get that judgement, friend?" he turned back to a drug addict who felt that it was starting to turn against him and that he might not have to be a drug addict very soon.
Here's what the co-worker gave me when I arrived.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to a courtyard to a fourteenth," the narcotics said.
And there aren't any judgments, that's what he's been, so I put it in the folder.
"So, when you are included in the technical function, this paper paper is enough for you," the Chief of Sushi said.
The drug was nervous and did not have any response.
"No, we're going to talk about it later," concluded the question of the chief and the narcotics apparently slowed down.
So far, it's up.
"What about you, co-worker?" said the chief officer again.
Suddenly I'm going, so it's over!
I was dark in my eyes, I was hot.
He followed the charges and charges, and I knew that I was the most resisting creature in the world who doesn’t deserve mercy.
That by underlining the incomplete judgment, I made a mistake in the co-worker of the incomplete reporter, and I didn't understand why the judgment was incomplete when I received it from the incomplete reporter in the fabric.
I am also an anti-socialist life which, at the time of building real socialism, supports the rejection of religious darkness, even participates in them.
That, there was a lot of what I did, or maybe I still sin, and I prayed to end it.
I didn't care about it.
I didn't care to fly out of the mechanic's place.
I didn't care if they'd take me that bullet too.
This is a work for honest and decent people, not for the enemies of the people, as I was in the eyes of the co-worker of the chief.
"That would be enough, co-chairman's colleague," said the party's president suddenly, interrupting the Leviticus' chiefs.
Here's a companion who made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he did, just foolish!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, co-chairman!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to the side for a while!
To open him again, he will have to prove that he has changed and that he is worthy of our trust again.
The untrained bachelor spoke as a book.
Where did that happen in him?
Has he been so grateful or popeful of the phrases from party training and meetings?
That’s why this young co-worker has to get a chance from us too!
The chance to prove that he has changed.
And who's going to give it to him if not you, co-chairmate?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, somewhat wrong fellow, in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty that no one will get you rid of!
In fact, it is a party duty to all of us too.
The companion must see that the party hasn't forgotten him.
She is not only punishable as a kind mother, but also loves her.
When the president is over, no one reads.
No one expected such a turn of the situation.
At least I.
"I totally agree with you, co-chairman," the Chief Icelandic said in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me talk, you'd hear that I was just going to that conclusion.
All of them were shaking their heads, but they saw that they did not believe him even the word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate reporter for basic funding care," I cried when I returned to the office, and I cried.
Besides Eve’s engineers, they were all at lunch.
That silently listened to my unrelated cutting out of fresh experiences, and I still calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I could have a coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she put water on the cook and washed the bowls.
In the meantime, she talked about drug practices.
As one judgement, often full of praise, they give a person into the hand, and the other, where there is some spider, send to a new employer.
But I didn't end where I had it, but at the knife, so the co-workers from the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our drugs?
He's just getting old where he's eating or drinking, and that's what he's done.
"That's from the old man," she said maliciously.
He will certainly not taste him today.
Be careful, he's fairly wrecked.
What about the party president?
In essence, a much worse captain, no lidumil.
Zero from a crusher with great power.
The water for coffee began to crash, and the office was filled with the smell of just zalité coffee.
I put a sugar bowl in the bowl and quietly mixed a hot leather.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
They don't leave me now, and other checks are only in three years.
Anyway, my co-chairman wouldn't forget that day.

The symbol of the municipality.
The wind windmill over Chlum is turning back after years.
It is seen far away, because it is located at a fifteen meters high staircase.
People from the surrounding area are called "The Wind on the Chlum."
For the municipality, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipality, which the municipality gained for the opportunity of a robbing in 2010.
"We asked for a sign then, and we wanted to have the winds on the sign, of course, everyone knows it around," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
Chlumska wind pump is a local technical monument.
It’s a little bit like today’s memento: it reminds people of the time when they fought for quality drinking water.
In the last centuries, it was rare.
Until 1910, the Khlumian representatives decided to make solutions that were then implemented until the late 1980s.
In the village on the departure of Chichov, they were allowed to deepen seven meters of deep holes.
Three years later, the fountain was filled with metal structures with a wind pump, which pumped water into a tank at the highest point of the municipality, near the church here.
"The establishment was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic on Morava at the expense of 2,400 crowns," the memory inscription on the ground-breaking structure of the stojarra.
The pump after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the Water Battle began to be written: that day, a new water pipeline began to be used in Chlum.
The wind pump has already remained only a non-functional general symbol and here’s rarito.
Domination was carried out at this year's birthday crash.
Until 2008, the Chlumists decided to repair the wind bike again and bring it back to the hill.
They let the original wheel replica - reduced on average by half a metre.
The bike was planted on a staircase, but still in the same year it had to be cut down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the bike could not resist the wind breaks.
Then the Chlum dominated for several years, resting under the roof.
However, since June, the bike is on the high staircase again.
At the time of the rainfall, the municipality let the replica of the wheel adjust and resettled it at the top of the iron tower.
But the bike pumps useful water from the fountain only to the overlap of the blind shoulder.
And throughout the summer, we completely removed him, because there was little water in the cave.
It was at least unclear.
"In the autumn, we will turn off the wind wheels from the pump in the sailing basket again," said Machek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind bike has become the municipal mark, but is the only inner of this species in the entire Higher Land.
A similar element in the character are in honor of local technical monuments, for example, in Chvalkovics and the Green Mountains on Vyškovska, in Kuželova on Hodoninska, Partutovics on Prerovska or in Police on Vsetínska.
Nothing in bad, but I don't know Lafatu, admitted Tripolis Goian's rape.
"I remember my goal, like everyone in my career," a 34-year-old Goian smiled at a press conference.
At that time we were trained by George Hagi, it was a joke that we lost.
Hopefully I'll give Sparta a goal now.
This is the difference that we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man who played 60 matches for Romanian representation is the key resistance of the Greek team.
As a trail, he will face the Spartan offensives.
There will be a few thousand people coming, no hell, says Spartan Hybsch of the Greek war.
And partly knows what you can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in the Romanian Asther with my brother Lucian.
At that time I saw all their matches.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta too, Goian said.
Another footballer of the Prague club was not named, so there was a direct question whether he also knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and looked at the Czech journalists with a slight calculation.
The unfair expression in the face meant, "Why are you asking me about it?"
I'm silent for a moment.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta was playing a lot of teams.
He has really good players.
The Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone else except Fataie.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
“I have experience from larger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, that is their organizer of the game,” Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal said.
Goian has already had the best years behind him, but he can boast of a very interesting football biography.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but he went from Steauy to the Italian Palermo, playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We are waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a great team, regularly playing European cups, washing for victory in the Czech League.
It's my favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in the room with the Slovenian guard Thomas Košický, who is very happy with the Czech competitor.
I too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to Czech Republic, considering the entrance to the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. has been registered in Poland because of the company’s stock trading at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we are currently taking within the framework of the project are mostly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on the events in society, says Daniel Burysh, Financial Director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the move of the headquarters, shareholders are considering the placement of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Securities Exchange, Prague will complete a prospect of securities, which will present the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of holding headquarters and related share transfers will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction with the participation of only existing shareholders.
As part of this operation, no shares will be offered for public registration or to new investors.
"A suitable offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders decide so - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that a possible offer of shares could consist of new shares issued or sales of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of stock stocks in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of stocks at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Testing the objectives of the Czech TV in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectiveness and balance of the Czech main media report on the refugee crisis.
This time the main news release of Czech TV.
How did she stay?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism how the media can manipulate reality, they can leave today’s broadcasting of the Czech TV Event.
Around 80% of the reports were sent to the migrant crisis.
Until the first minute when ČT informed about concerns on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on policemen called euphemistic to them patience - throwing stones and attacking metal shirts), now the pro-immigrant propaganda - evaluate the names of individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize misconduct with migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees are not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Refugees traveling - CT consistently uses the terms of a refugee or refugee rather than a migrant.
It’s mainly important that the CT in illustration pictures uses consistently only and only pictures for small children and women.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Overview: Mostly propaganda, which has no era of communist agitation.
I have to say I am ashamed of my colleagues as a former journalist.
Ecology in practice.
When I once came to a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
I was moved to the Umakart bath.
The domestic fish, an insect with a change of imperfection, i.e., not selling that recycling from the housekeeper to the brook and youth looks like an adult, it is only small and gradually growing.
They've been resisting me and I didn't hide them.
First, manually and later chemically.
Socialist drugs for their elimination provided some sort of blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or otherwise?
However, it was successfully eliminated.
Later, I treated the Pharaohs likewise.
A box with a youth analyst that brought the mosquitoes into the shell and then did not allow the queen to generate a new descendant.
But I rejected it.
As time went, it became also an insect the subject of my admiration, and I was increasingly appealing to the opinion that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I gained experience from my life that intervention in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one harmful can replace the other.
Truth in blues and chickens I wouldn't seem to get worse of their karma by killing them.
In the new home, we agreed with our partner that if the fishermen don’t fall for our neck, let the fishermen eat in the calm, some of those invisible garlics and so on.
Their calm existence over time disrupted the pavement.
It was a typical type of cowboy that had long been sitting on the ceiling.
We had the fact that he lived from occasional mushrooms and comers, which just increased comfort to us.
Since he had spent several years with us, we found that they lived mostly in fish, and that their number was apparently maintained in a drastic numbering state.
With a confidential regular contact at any given need, we found that it was a female.
We were witnesses of romantic conversations with a partner about a third less than causing the cotton fibers to be scratched before it reaches the collapse.
It took about three days when they did not move and did not even respond to our controls.
Under the bathroom mix where love toys were played, next to the females we found the remains of a dry male later.
Then he walked for a long time and did not sleep.
When we thought that it was already behind us, we were surprised by a number of small pavillons, hanging a porch around it.
They're gone soon.
They were handed over by Mom, and they were handed over by Mom.
Even the woman disappeared somewhere after a week.
If she went elsewhere or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared again on the ceiling.
True, somewhat smaller, probably the daughter of that toilet.
For some time, she carefully observed our behaviour from the ceiling and moved under the bathroom, evaluated our non-attack as friendship.
The numbers of somewhat multiplied fish have decreased again, and the flood is looking at its normal activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem has not changed all year round.
My daughter grew up at the age when the use of the nightmare was already ashamed.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal removal of its content has already come to us.
We encouraged it to use the bathroom more and more.
However, her daughter found an excuse to maintain her immorality in the pavement on which she saw very well when she was defeated.
The fact that the papal saw, the luck in the house did not take it at all.
She cried and forced her nightmare.
There was no disruption.
There was a moment when the papal had to go, in the interest of the development of the daughter, ordering.
It's left for me.
He was taken into a glass and moved through the balcony somewhere into the garden.
I've been lucky with him as a friend, but after such a long life I still felt crazy as if I was kidding a relative.
We assumed fishermen would begin to appear more frequently and will begin to multiplie in a geometric range.
A week, two, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a week, a
I started speculating about the cause.
I wondered if there was a pavement in the pattern of the Moravins in a way that the bathroom environment wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size emerged, and they have been swallowed again.
I had to invent another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their link to the papal had to have the reason that if they didn't see him, they were hidden elsewhere and threatened them from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connections with their predator, and his rapid disappearance in them caused some terrible reaction.
Instead, I don't have any illusions about their vision.
Some light of flatness indicated, but if they react to washing hands or fast movements, that is not.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she has forgotten the nightmare.
It's just left to get a pavement back.
I'm already sending my wishes to an ether, and I hope they didn't hate me after the execution.
Otherwise, we should use the Cyclone B.
The 10th anniversary of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The prophecies of a genial scientist from the last century will obviously never stop fascinating humanity.
He was able to get so deep into everything that the crop was always a stunning finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In the consciousness of people, he entered his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in his gigantic relationship.
It cannot also be remembered by his explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description and system of knowledge of the popular relativity theory is so unlikely for many that they prefer to choose easy directions for the next meeting.
But it's not easy.
However, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a genially simplified form of explanation: The hour near your beloved seems to be a minute; the minute in a hot oven seems to be an hour - and that's relativity.
I have allowed myself to pick out the ten of his entire pleasure of famous citrates that literally captured me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not sure about the first one.
No number of attempts can never prove that I was right.
However, the only one can prove that I’ve been wrong at any time.
It’s a sad time when it’s easier to break the atom than to destroy prejudice.
If an irregularity on the table reflects an irregularity in the mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what to fight in the Third World War, but in the fourth there will be rocks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to raise him.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much too.
If I had an hour to cope with the problem that my life would hang on, I would spend 40 minutes in his study, 15 minutes in his analysis and 5 minutes in his solution.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
Finally, I can’t forgive Einstein’s formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula is A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest, and Z is to keep the tooth behind.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlinska are expected to change for 1.5 billion.
“It’s a success when we consider that all four are held in black numbers throughout this year,” said Stanislav Mišák.
The total gain of rural facilities is currently around 32 million krone.
Its shares are mainly higher than insurance companies, which are equally beneficial for this year.
This also shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally allow more investment.
In Kroměříži, Vsetíná, Hungarian Hradišti and Zlína, it is a link to buildings that will cost nearly 1.5 billion crowns together.
The long period when we purchased mostly equipment is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them the top healthcare cannot be done, he has reasoned the plans of the country area for healthcare Lubomír Nečas.
He is looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders will come to hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, a new internal pavillion is now chosen for nearly 300 million crowns.
There is a planned port of dialyse in Kroměříž.
The Hungarian Castle wants to set a new interior for about 200 million to the open central pavilion this year.
And Bath’s liner hospital is waiting for a long delayed construction of a new central income and interior, which will require three quarters of billions.
In all cases, these are the most important and most important changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the entire region, patients and doctors," said Vera Prousková, the interior director of the hospital, for example.
The five-storey building will be ready for about two years and will provide comfortable equipment for internal and neurologic, dialyse, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are largely known to patients will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, only one bathroom on the floor, beds are unreliable, windows are intact and healthcare providers do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our internal was built forty years ago and now it's on the border of its lifetime," said Paul Calábek, director of Zlin Hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by the seven-storey modern building associated with an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute departments in one place, in addition to new spaces.
The same model has already finished half of the Hunger Square.
The central income is already cost and it will be internal within three years.
"We will pay the establishment from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained the Director Petr Sládek.
This hospital can allow its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still the highest and hasn't lost even two years ago, when the liner's hospital has suffered nearly two million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase revenue and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdak, who is concerned about the economy.
Improvements are also expected for patients to cross hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, it will go into repairs, new equipment and renovations up to half a billion krone.
For this year, the repair of the trap station will be completed, then the construction of the dialyse starts, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one told me how I should keep the refugees accepted in the country if they don’t want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Interior Minister Milan Chovanec, after negotiating with its European colleagues, complains that the other Czech states are pushing to adopt quotas for redistribution of refugees, but reject any debate.
It also suggests that no one has explained to him how to keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they don’t like to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, so we wanted quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the negotiations of the European Union's Ministers of Home and Foreign Affairs?
We disagree with compulsory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can’t talk about migrants like salt or milk.
They are living beings, who have some visions, they go somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we were able to maintain migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not receive the answer, and therefore we wanted quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, so we have no problem.
We’ve been talking about it for a year and say that this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Recently we solved forty-two thousand, now it is hundred-two thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how can we keep those people in this area?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
No one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have an ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, but the interest of people from this wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don’t want us, but fifteen hundred people are already committed to accepting.
Wouldn’t it be possible to take them more on this way?
We have committed to accepting 1,500 people, but with the condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
There will be 1,100 people with whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They come to our detention facility and we'll behave with them as well as those we caught.
It is a big question, and we will discuss with Europe whether we can arrest people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or if possible in Hungary.
Because Europe is acting in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be arrested.
This means they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is no agreement yet, we may not even hold the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will return to Germany after the arrival.
If we are able to arrest them during the asylum procedure, we will conduct an asylum procedure with them.
If it were Syrian citizens, Eritrea, almost 98 percent, according to European statistics, gained international protection.
They will then get documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think that these people will end up again in the target countries.
Then there are four hundred people here who will relocate.
This is the second project that is currently moving forward, and we have only progressed in discussing with churches the possibility that they can help them get jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But it's a very long run.
You said that the other countries were not willing to discuss the negotiations of ministers with us.
But is it not that the Czech Republic just refuses quotas, but does not offer any solidarity step that would unlock the discussion?
What exactly does it mean to be a solid step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany urges that all Syrian migrants can reach them, the report will spread in a timely range throughout all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This is a further migration wave that goes to Germany because they simply don’t want to come to us.
We believe that the road is the protection of the external borders - simply to deter the waves of migration, to help the necessary, and to separate economic migrants.
It's clear that they don't have a chance.
Only last year, there were fifty thousand Kosovons in Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representatives.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or only accept them according to the needs of the economies, then fifty percent of what social systems don’t spend today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detained in the Czech Republic jumped up.
Now it is eighty, the first day it was twelve.
Where is it going to happen to checks at the borders?
We were afraid of catching hundreds of people in order.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we are holding will return to Austria within seven days.
We do it standard.
They are the only ones who bring us these people, with Hungary it is complicated, and the Greeks - it is a completely unnecessary story.
Where is the break point?
Should it be a thousand per day?
I think it should be just a few hundreds a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three each day we are exhausting our capacity so much that crisis plans are coming up.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately appoint an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
If the situation occurred, the government could de facto immediately, and by one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police on the army, we would do this to the customs administration, or, if applicable, to the prison service.
The ultimate variant is an exceptional state that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think this can happen to us so far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only at the airport.
I don't know what should happen to make this happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread terrible information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, proves that the Hungarians will try to remove the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have had a very extreme impact, almost at all.
The celebration has paid a great deal of the debt in the last minute.
They try to prevent the failure of the bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid the debts.
The money was also paid by footballers.
Football Slavia took place on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after the proposal was submitted by Online Services from the Pacific Samoa because of about 20 million crowns.
Slavia’s legal representative Zuzana Young attempted to convince judge Michael Wenzl in a few hours that she did not have to declare the fall over Slavia.
And I have to say that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week with the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industry and investment group CEFC, as well as a Czech billionaire Jiří Šimaina.
Obviously, the money from the new owners came to the club in the last minute.
This also proves that Slovenia's statement before a Tuesday court meeting - the vršov club on Monday, just a day before the court negotiations, sent a debt of tens of millions of crowns.
"All were arrested between September 11 and September 15," said Slavia Mládková.
To whom did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, the Slovak representative Milan Ivan, or the Czech reservant Mariu Ličkovi.
Slavia also paid the fees to agent Alexander Losenicke.
On Friday, the club also paid debt charges in the city area of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, de facto remain only the claims that Slavie opposes.
Or, according to the club, the obligation has not occurred at all, or there are court disputes about it.
However, we are ready to pay the amount in the event of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can submit out of the account," Mládková told the lawyer.
"Everything that was after expiry was damaged," she said, adding that the unreserved are only free or disputed commitments.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the next few days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavii three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the debt.
Then all evidence will be evaluated.
Decisions can be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on the third November.
However, the decision does not take place at this meeting, but only in writing.

Flexibility is ensured, there is less rewards, more welding and higher profit.
This year’s news was a premiere in Nitra, where she also won the gold medal.
We appreciate this honour because it confirms the exceptionality of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers can praise similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is the world’s top.
For stakeholders, the delivery periods are also pleasant, which moves about three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already linked the first contacts that will certainly continue to expand after the Brno fair.

FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
The blade was built so that it did not fail.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
The blade was even safer, says the expert.
The tunnel complex Blanka was possible to build in such a way that there were no two earthquakes in Prague Stromovce, says Satra’s production director, Alexander Butovič, the main designer of the tunnel.
He said it on Wednesday afternoon at a press survey of the tunnel.
He said it would be more than half a billion dollars.
It opens to the drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went off safer, but costs are growing exponentially," Butovič said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovce were the same throughout the time, although the land was missing only a few steps from the place where it began to spread with a safer and more cautious method.
"If these measures were used by 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovič said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.
Two times, in 2008, a crater founded in Stromovce, in 2010, the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessaryly expensive, the Euro weekline said.
According to its original intention, the building had 17 billion krones.
When we add VAT to that, which has doubled up during the construction period, you have one hundred and fifteen billion.
When it comes to technology, land purchases and engineering activities, values and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer so far from the 37s, Bělohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple update
A new operating system may be required in Settings when you click the "General" tab and select "Software Update".
When ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.
Some users faced a problem after installation, in particular the error message "software update failed".
One of the solutions to this problem is to wait until you’re interested in updating or try it through iTunes.
The phone will make you through the update process.
This includes the need to uninstall the apps to release the space - but this will not be necessary because Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the entire process using a special tool that will design the user to delete and reinstall the app after the update is finished.
Make sure your phone is charged before you start the update.
If the battery status is low, Apple will not allow the update to run because the interruption of the process could cause an update error.

FedEx mixed profits, reduction in fiscal views for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfied results in the last quarter and significant reduction in the forecasts of full-year profit due to low cargo demand and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
In this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company’s shares fell by approximately 2.5 percent in pre-trading trade 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx says it expects a salary between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, which means a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The decreased view comes despite an average increase in interest rates by 4.9%, which will appear in January 4, and higher charges for land transportation of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher income and growth in online trading.
Chairman of the Board and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "has made a strong performance despite the expected economic conditions, particularly in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced a day after the UPS rival said it plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 additional employees, which is approximately the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
The markets rose by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts asked by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been affected by a decline in the priority of international maritime transport, causing revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But boom in online shopping has enhanced the results of the FedEx Earth Unit.
In the last quarter, land revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profits were basically the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profits in the cargo trade fell due to higher labour prices.
About an hour before the opening of FedEx's shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a reduction of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under the record of 11 June.
At its most unexpected session throughout the year, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week settled at a 27-foot Hondurian mahagon table and will decide whether the time has come to increase the key interest rate after nearly ten years.
The two-nuclear meeting room will be the U.S. wall painting on one end of the ornament of the central bank.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have to give the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The Central Bank has two congress charges: maximizing American employment and keeping the prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, the representatives of Fed recognized that there was an unwritten third functioning period: financial stability.
And this third functioning period could be an X factor too close to the predictable decision, which is to be announced on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch in the form of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of nearly zero short-term interest rates on the ground since the end of 2008.
Although most data show solid growth in the economy, recent turbulence in the global financial markets could already be scared by the Fed due to adding to the inconsistency by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even by nothing more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour and inflation market will be the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, head economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for a reminder to increase the level, the increased uncertainty around the global market already gives them sufficient reason to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what Fed is doing, which is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
Approximately half of the economists recently asked by Blomberg anticipated rate rise this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances to increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed would increase the rates, only if the politicians would fall short with a swear that the further increase would be inconceivable.
On Tuesday, the industrial average of Dow Jones jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was launched with the expectation that Fed politicians will delay rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, head economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if Fed had raised rates now," he said.
If the Fed politicians would do so, they would have to go to the extremity in their program statement and keep the financial markets in hand so that they don’t fall in panic.
Other experts have argued that the increase in rates would clear the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty from how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Fed was on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in slowing down monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the United States.
Yellen said that this year’s rates are expected to increase in spring and early summer, despite the liberal complaints that more economic progress is needed.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, the labour market saw solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate has decreased to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers to be full-employment.
The wages showed signs of rise.
And although inflation continues to be under the annual 2% target of the Central Bank, the Fed politicians argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
“The economy can cope with higher rates and needs them, in view of the labour market tightness,” said Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics’ chief economist.
But the financial markets around the world began to dismiss at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones dropped up to 16% under its record value in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would drop global growth.
The market was slightly reflected this month and Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of the May maximum.
Fed’s political agents have the uncomfortable market situation provided a comprehensive calculation when to calculate an increase in interest rates.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and reports about the Chinese economy's weaknesses in the last few weeks, there would be a confusion at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, chief researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former Fed official.
Now it predicts that they are waiting for at least a month to get better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact it will have on the U.S. economy and they have almost no data that they could rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health condition of the global economy is not one of the main interests of Fede, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The impact of the central banks in recent years has been enormous.
The only sign of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "shape" their monetary expansion on the market, dropped crashes around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely linked, Fedu representatives can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history overwhelmed with movements on financial markets that appear to be unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who pushed to increase rates, cited the decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage point during three sessions "I've had limited identification impacts on growth in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed’s representatives turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize financial stability concerns only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England Rate Setting Committee.
The latest is not even closer to this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rate growth because the markets are shaking," said Posen, President of the Institute for International Economics, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act has another double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese district.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter
The market was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese quarter, not a Thai quarter.
The market is the only contact site that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian cuisine, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need a little motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you for an hour before you cross all the streets.
If you are hungry, go to the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trade tent (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various shopping sites.
What is in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You will probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in large.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
Extension of meat is large, for example, fish - employees will wash and cost you behind the table, even suppressing it if you want it,
A good part of the store is left with a massive frozen section where you will find frozen caries leaves, hot meloun and galangal, whole cakes, fish, bovine blood and bulbs, pigs, fish bubbles, regional pockets, free shopping semi-staffs and more.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Wide streets come across shopping malls and high-air malls.
Finding: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash station.
Where: The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of the Chinese neighborhood and centers - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot that shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the shop can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the roads will remain in the old.
An acceleration of 150 km/h Smovna rejected.
The highest permitted speed will not be increased in favourable conditions on selected routes to 150 km/h.
On Tuesday, Parliament decided to join the Senate's amendment which refused to increase speed.
The new Earth Communications Act is now going to the President.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that the law would wind the speed of a hundred and fifty kilometers.
On the contrary, the Minister of Transport Dan <0xC5><0xA2>ok (ANO), according to which the Czech road network has not yet been built at such a speed.
On Tuesday, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved novel will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase speed from 90 to 110 km/h on selected first-class roads, particularly four-stage roads.
The House first extended this option to the roads on which it could be driven at the selected speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused it.
Members have now joined his proposal.
Senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also excluded the authorization of the transport police to have the last word in the adjustment of local communications that the municipalities care for.
The Senate version approved by the House also calculates that channels, water pipes or public lighting cables can be stored long under the car surface.
The locals would save for the redemption of land.
Municipalities should also not have an obligation to take care of road vegetation along the local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
Novela also aims to improve road protection and facilitate urban transportation with carriage vehicles that owners do not report to.
The new municipalities could sell withdrawn vehicles, which their owners will not be notified within six months of the notification of withdrawal.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit cargo transport through their territory by roads of second and third classes under a threat of fines for shipment companies.
The new one also discourages the possibility of introducing electronic roadmarks instead of papers to date, which will also be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The speaker is in court.
He has been threatened for 10 years for the congratulations of his citizens.
The case is allegedly related to a project of welcome to citizens.
Police also wanted to strike Ms. Zuzan Kail in this case, but the House did not leave it.
According to legal qualifications, the case threatens up to ten years of imprisonment.
The main layer is scheduled for two October days.
According to the State Prosecutor Mandík and Macik, at least one million crowns were damaged, arising from the charge.
The applicant is based on a knowledge assessment.
Former members of the city’s leadership, under the title of the prosecutor, have unlawfully enabled the property benefit of the company that organized the welcoming citizens.
According to the accusation of the then chief of the Magistrate Committee of Urban Services, Education and Culture, Mandick ordered five associated companies to be held in the selection procedure.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, entered the competition, the mayor cancelled the competition.
The order was then to be assigned to the administrator, and only Darothore, which was then assigned by the City Council, was enrolled in the competition.
The city paid at least a million additional.
Both accusations are carried out in order to ensure that Darothore is awarded a public procurement to organize a Welcoming Citizens in Ústí nad Labem event for a long time and have been coordinated at least in contravention to the requirement of a proper economic care procedure, the State Prosecutor writes.
At the same time, he said, they were aware that Darothore subsequently, after receiving this contract, calculates Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome to Citizens, which will be disproportionately increased compared to the actual value of the actual services provided.
In three years, the company has injected more than five million crowns for the project.
The city finally paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then resigned from the contract.
The amount paid was, according to the expert estimate, a minimum of a million crowns.
Mandick has previously rejected any violation of the law.
I haven't forgiven any crime, I'm innocent.
I don’t understand this case, said the former prime minister, with the fact that the city under his leadership was only linked to a similar project from the past years.
Between 2008 and 2010 the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminals were originally accused of Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
The House of Appeals did not give her a complaint.
Therefore, criminals have delayed the case in her case, but count on the fact that Kail is accused after her mandate has ended.
The welcome to citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police allegedly have left a dog for refugees.
Then the journalists were forced to delete the record.
Hungarian police said they had shortly arrested the cameraman of the AP agency and forced him to delete a recording on which the police dog allegedly hit the country of the refugee.
But the Hungarian government has questioned the accusation.
The incident occurred on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through the corn field near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Police were attacked against refugees, and one of them let a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on a coat.
The dog who shouted, "Please, I'm a refugee," said Muzi.
That Muzi filmed everything, he noticed one of the police officers and didn't let him leave.
The reporter was no longer allowed to call either his supervisors or his colleagues.
Muzi's police led him to a dark place at the Refugee Registration Center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
This resulted in two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He said he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP has sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovács.
The behaviour of the policemen in it was unacceptable and said that journalists should have the opportunity to cover events without risking physical violence and not fear the government would destroy the legally acquired material.
Kovács, with a complaint to Muzi's police report, questioned the incidents.
He said the police just wanted the journalist to show them if they were on some recordings, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out that they weren't there, they didn't have to remove him.
"Dogs can scream - they are trained to scare and hinder fear, but they haven't attacked with certainty," Kovács says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
Winning on the City will win us, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, a hometown coach.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic match of the Champions League.
None of the teams created a lot of opportunities, but we had a ball on the balls for a long time.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," Pellegrini rated, whose team incassed in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the previous season Juventus was exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, the defender has only a point and score 2:4 is located at 16th place in the table.
And that’s why turning to the Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This victory will help us mentally, to strike us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Téveze and Vidala.
In Manchester, Pogba, Mandžukich and Morata were represented.
"It's so, this victory is extremely important, perhaps thanks to it we're going to hire a winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we are on it, we are among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
My players deserve this result.
"In front of our balanced goal, we could on the contrary incasate at 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," said Allegri's coach Gulman Buffon.
"We've burned a few good chances," said Yayu Tour, a City backup officer.
We have to take from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Bye, Angelo, Bye, Old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all of the media tremors around are governed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also the nurse.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children carrying their parents on the dust roads of exodus.
And this causes in a person, in Europe, a feeling of guilt and compassion automatically.
Well, those who come here aren't just desperate children, look at the pictures of landing boats to the Greek islands that the children don't see so much on them!
Well, and somehow, we have disappeared from the television images of ships flying to Lampedusa, refugees from the French border at Menton, with thousands of young men on their beautiful walks.
Most of the young blacks.
Also, pictures from Callais disappeared, where these dinner and black men are waiting for them to get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I guess she can't do it anymore.
Neither those images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritrea did make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
That's too much fakeness.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it is somewhat secret that it is not only about unfortunate children from Syria, but also about exposed - for older: fashionably decorated - young men.
Their muscles look like they just get out of a fitness center.
Only one personal experience for that.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus we lay on the private beaches of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no dogs.
The young black people came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in brandwear and shoes, in their hands, otherwise, smartphones.
That it is a private beach, it wasn’t interesting, and employees – Turkish, Muslims! – were obviously afraid of them.
They contain all the bags.
Whoever wasn't lying on him and was just in the sea, he was laughing.
They were dressed like an American rapper film.
On the heads of the hat with nails, white and colorful adidaski on the legs.
Then they dressed the local beach bar and started hiking.
They placed the tables around, forced them to sit next to the dinner and white bar guests - reading Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming blackmen drank beer straight from one-third - like in the U.S. series?! - throwing empty bottles around the beach.
They shouted to each other loudly.
In English, it wasn't.
Then they poured wine into the drink, even straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel swimming pool - in the brands, especially those young ladies - in the water, they were jealous and crying, mothers with children and retirees frightenedly fled, and in half an hour there was no one black guest at the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel’s staff were just talking about them.
The cleaner said to me midnight, "Have you seen the gold that they had on them?"
"Yes," I said.
“They certainly didn’t work,” said the coward.
I remember: "I know, everyone around their neck had massive gold chains.
And one on his neck had about twenty centimeters of gold mass cross.
And women were like gold.
"That's a drug dealer?" I asked.
"You've always seen them cool," the wizard replied.
Drugs don’t take or take.
They have something completely different.
So I was already aware of what they did.
In June 2105, it wasn’t so important to me.
I didn't know what's going on.
But secret services and top politicians had to know it first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
They go and go and go.
Today it has been shown that the European Union's main problem is that totalitarian-political-corrigible politicians, such as intellectual and related lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - today publicly recognized main forces in Europe - lies, lies and lies - but not only they, including EU tops and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images about the enthusiastic welcome to refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow television images of August 1968.
Of course, there were a couple of sunflowers at the station, but mainly - the ancient Germans - Muslims welcomed their fellowmen.
For weeks, they have been blaspheming in the Czech TV reports, according to some research, the Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
Anyone who was just a few days in Germany knows that it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
It also lies on our TV.
However, they secretly told the second day in Germany: in a poll vote for the article, 94.5% of Germans no longer want immigrants - 67,000 people participated in the polls.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, that is, five years ago: “Our effort to multi-kulti community has failed completely.”
He said, "Germany is giving up the fight for multicultural society."
"All efforts for such a cohesion have totally failed."
In a country in which four million Muslims live, there was no strategy that allowed people from different cultural environments to live next to each other without integrating themselves. Today they live here with us for a while, and we have been struggling that they won’t leave one day again.
But that's not reality.
Multicultural approach when we say we just live happy next to each other, this approach failed.
It's totally failed.
But even Merkel has no power to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correction.
This shows the escalation of events.
Conflict is rapidly rising.
Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, a Member of the SPD, is the only one who claims to have no maturity in the European Parliament - yes, that is what Berlusconi said in the EU parliament that he could play supervisory in the concentrate for a minute - as he has already presented several times.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last few years of German politicians, that Germany has crossed Rubikon.
Let's note that only for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the citizens of the countries that were victims of Nazism are scared.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have been trying for years, at least in order to deal with their terrible past of an aggressor and the killer of millions?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany there is a devil of aggressiveness, superiority and violence?
Did Chancellor Otto von Bismarck have been right when he stopped the attempts of the High Priests to control the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say that the German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he had.
When he was dismissed, he began preparing for World War I.
The Great German idea that brought Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives is likely to come back in a different form.
After Marxist attempts to control the state, for example, with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and the failure of the NDR, in Germany, for example, based on ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of Nazism, began to develop new German ideology.
We'd say sunny.
The German elites have long defended the formation of German nationalism, leaving all those fighters against the atoms in peace, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old emperor and Nazi password Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy uncalled young people who want to do something different and better around the world, they have fully devoted themselves to the side of fighters against the planet’s heating, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strong anti-Semitic -- so-called propalestine -- and anti-Slovakia stream that considers all the Slovaks as a difficult verb -- since the age of Karl Marx, who, according to the parents, was mainly German nationalist.
And as Schulz’s last statements and German mentors show openly threatening to non-obedient eastern states, the idea of leadership Germany.
Which must be listened without excuse.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we combine that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, capital, particularly the German, which suits and which is due to the fact that Germany actually controls most of the countries of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudovir of the sunflowers first brought the Germans into the base of ecology and multiculturalism and brought them home today, bringing even millions of Muslims.
"Which, blown by the voices of the Syrians, soon blows into the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they'll start to blow.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbours by force, but, as it appears, a smaller part of its population can again, ideologically disturb it, but, in the end, the reality of it is as always defeated.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are already burning.
What will the German government do when the Germans’ public protests against the incoming Islamists take place?
Why do Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time come to help, but certainly not assimilars to take over local habits and laws?
What will the German government do until naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, following fear of Islamization of their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and at all to Germany, when people rise up who will protest publicly against the new euro superhumanity to the Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict, which has led to the support of solar ideology in Europe, that is, the elite ideology and, in principle, the totalitarian, and its non-resident banks, is growing.
And because of the uncontrollable acts against the disobedient Democratic Germans and all subordinate and disobedient Eastern neighbours, it cannot work well.
End of tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of trapped sellers: scare them to death.
Just hang on and a robust clamp will climb on you in a way that you don’t have to be weaker.
The lively head of you will be beautifully swallowed and even mature, on the way away will accompany (or rather swallowed) an unexpected soldier, even the lively soya.
Perhaps it’s unfortunate that the speaker’s clay can’t even be used in fact.
We also have a lot of excitement and shadows.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
Small wheat that tolerates dry environment.
And so it is located among the outer plates near my residence.
On September 16, 2015 I photographed a beautiful plant, which, however, belongs to expansive crops, but it creates a beautiful impression of flowers.
It is located among the outer plates.
She's unexpected, she's going to be with us in the garden.
He likes a dryer environment, is easily adaptable, modest and inexplicable.
She creates leaves with chaotic composition, but it is worth watching and photographing it further.
Under a small view, the beauty of the detail is only found - yellow flowers and green leaves as well with a violet accompaniment.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet in breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatrician company SPRS came with a shocking way to try to mediate women’s knowledge of the importance of a good diet while breast-feeding using pictures of children from the breast painted unhealthy food.
Human maternal milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to excess energy demands, pregnant women and newborn mothers are recommended to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys indicate that increased calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should control.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic development of their children and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take over the lead in Today Show
In contrast, Karl Stefanovice and Lisy Wilkinson to Canberry, due to covering the costs of the result of the liberal leadership escape, failed to create sufficient increases for Today.
The Nine Morning Show is released from national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat by Tony Abbott.
The Sunrise rival with hosts David Koch and Samanthou Armytage have been sealed in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara waterfalls and Cancun.
It did not seem to be so important for Aussie TV spectators in this tyranny as it recorded an average of 397,000 spectators in five major cities compared to 330,000 spectators in today.
Today was a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only last Thursday (343,000).
Today, in the last few months, it is filled with sunrise.
In August, Today was an average of 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the land was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 views and Today 314,000 views.
This is the most interesting thing that happened throughout the morning.
The winds of change affect more than just Parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your choice!
Added to TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
A great news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erick Thomson.
A new drama about a recent surprising father, who decides to move with his two children to the seaside of New Zealand, has an average of 1,219 million viewers.
The critics wondered if Thomson would be able to draw a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebeccy Gibney.
The result of last night gives a clear "yes".
The X Factor from Seven has left strong 1,136 million viewers, defeating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed tracking on the night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV queue (from 17:00 to 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe reported, had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped on 623,000 viewers — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720,000 viewers.
Hot Seat had an average of 620 000.
Thanks to the decline in The Chase Australia's second night rating, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will finally win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia was replaced by the Million Dollar Minute, who failed to defeat McGuire's show.

Three in the final agree that the Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who chooses?
The secret was revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not want to find out who wins the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to the Bachelor is inspired by an inexperienced secret.
And three girls who will remain in the state will certainly not disclose who is the real one who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows a day before only two of them were left, they told us who was going to win.
Sam Wood holds his tooth to the final of Thursday
All three women of lyrics saw why Wood was a perfect man, cited his sense of humor, ambitions, family values and positiveness as the reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who would get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a jointer about who gets the heart of the Bachelor.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, Markos quickly named Mackay as the one who would be the best to go to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a light relationship from one day.
“Since I entered my house and watched Sarah and Sam’s energy, I’ve felt they’re quite compatible and I’m still thinking about it during the course,” says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really dirty woman, she's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry among them.
They are good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could be a good couple.
For herself, she claimed that during her last visits at home she realized that Wood could be "the real one."
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer just a game – I opened to him my whole heart now,” he added.
I wondered who Wood would choose if he didn't look mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I like both girls as well - it's inconsistent between Snow and Lana.
Bachalor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in Ten.
Originally published as the best choice for Sarah for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle expressed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and many teams asked for his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jima Tomsula and looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches left Hayne sitting for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, making the conversion of the Australian rugby league at the first crash of the rugby on Tuesday 20:3 win in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to return and bet him in the game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of telling the newborns about the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received an encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only take care of another game.
During the first quarter of Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It wasn't the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped in his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio dum Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 to a worse start of his NFL career.
“It’s happening, you just focus on another game and it’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trap to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own port territory led to the Queensland Trinity.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne has published a photo with fans on which he holds the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin will meet in a discussion on homosexual rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested in the Siberian rain.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The US has stopped migrants who have repatriated property refunds.
Two emigrated in 1984, and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be refunded, so the two returned to the state to apply for compensation under the Non-South Rehabilitation Act.
The court first allocated them the required amount, i.e. more than 2.8 million krone, but the appeal court changed their claim by admitting only to them less than 90 thousand krones, with reference to the amount of refunds determined according to the price regulations of 1991.
The Supreme Court of Emigrants was arrested and initially charged with the amount of complaint.
The Ministry of Finance, which had to pay the money, turned into a complaint to the U.S.
In the meantime, such a change in the social and economic relationship has occurred that the compensation recognised under the applicable law - whether it was then a suitable compensation in relation to the dismissed property - now only reaches the fractured value of the property.
"This cannot be the case of side participants in the restitution of eligible persons who have been entitled to their rights at least since 1995 and who had not been able to grant refunds to the homeowners before," the judge Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the US was on the emigrant side.
"The US has repeatedly expressed it to the general courts to act in reimbursement cases in such a way that possible inconsistencies are not interpreted in the interests of eligible persons and that the purpose of reimbursement law is always achieved, that is, the default of the property curve caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state," he added.
Evitu in the studio DVA Musical is now created by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišar, by the way, became the world's youngest Evito, when in 1998 she created the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech presentation of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in Prague's Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, she says, "Today, the hardship of the performance has not been equal."
Evita is not just a wonderful role, it is also a responsibility.
In the role of Argentina's first lady, Monika Absolon recommended her.
I saw Monchu three times in Evita and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Suddenly I saw a completely new concept here.
I am a favourite of more modern edits, but this is simply particularly related.
"The regiment of Ondřeje Sokola is original, relieved and current," Fišar says.
The ideaal transmission of the musical shirt between the two singers will take place at the Monika Absolon’s birthday concert on September 27th from 19 hours in the Studio DVA theater.
It's a song from the music hall of Evita.
Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Don't Cry For Me, Argentina!) will certainly include the common duet.
In a limited number of performances, Ondrey Sokol will also jump out of the directory when he represents Karl Roden as President of Perón during filming.
Due to the public’s interest, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita introduces Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.

4 people killed after police shot rubber missiles on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber projectiles into a dam of demonstrators against a new constitution, the official said Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officer, said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered before the police station and some had thrown stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they turned to rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative, obviously caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern plane of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and relieve their political influence.
Another demonstration in Western Nepal was also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the establishment of its own state.
At least 40 people have been killed in violent conflicts since August 10, including 11 police officers.
when four main political parties signed a country’s distribution agreement to provinces — a big step towards the new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The new constitution has been working since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week in Kathmandu on the provisions of the constitutional draft and officials state that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We shouldn't panic right now.

NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of the Cape Town Islands
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Town Islands has 60% probability of the formation of tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system approximately in the middle of the Cape Town Islands and the Small Antils also has a 60% probability of the emergence of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added weather forecasts based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to choose $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said the launch of a campaign aimed at choosing $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries to escape from the war of disabled and poor countries.
Google has announced this on its blog a very unusual way.
The report was published on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience when she fled with her family from Kabul as a seven-year-old.
“We traveled in many dark flames and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I had luck.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is increasingly willing to help families like that.
All contributions will be divided into four non-profit refugee and immigrants aid organizations: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said all posts made via google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million were doubled.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them come from Syria, rejected by the four-year war, which only brought out four million people this year.
Many people escape from the war of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those with non-surgical treatment.
“Death data takes a long time to view,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide to a new JAMA survey surgical surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the surveys have been carried out in people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight ratio relating to height, is considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the overweight of people and people with a value above 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that addresses two types of barriar surgery - the stomach bypass and gastrektomia - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, BMI of those who did not receive surgery for diabetes remained approximately the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely solved in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1% of patients were completely solved for comparison of diabetes and partly only 2% of patients.
In addition, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol was proven to be "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best to maintain below 7% levels, researchers say.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - which reflects better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrektomie (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had a higher probability of reduction in diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While a new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they have found that surgery leads to life prolongation, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, overwhelming people who had been undergoing a bariatric surgery had approximately 29 percent greater chances of survival over the next 15 years, compared to a group that had tested more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not shown improvements in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone says it is a calming result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This work is critical right here because it says surgery is safer in a lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the patient’s BMI decline between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long for people to give the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that when the accumulation of these genetic changes that strongly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the journey back is already really difficult.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to understand all refugees, Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
Dalailama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech opening Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, a study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under current circumstances the interest of humanity should be placed in the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response to the refugee crisis in Western European countries, regardless of which it was admirable, was inadequate in this situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to resolve the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce murder in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the violence issues, Dalai Lama also expressed complaints on George Bush after a 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that “the U.S. violent reaction has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed sincere compassion in the letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and created unexpected consequences,” Dalailama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who experienced sanitation in the last four years
The toxicological center around the United States has reported nearly 400 percent growth in the number of children up to 12 years of age who have been infected with a high alcoholic sanitation, according to the Georgian toxicological center.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopeze, Director of Georgia’s Toxicological Center, the number of healthcare services for children under 12 years of age reported to the Toxin Control Center increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children get more frequently to these products and, unfortunately, there is a percentage of children that must be taken to emergency," said Lopez CNN.
Some children are deliberately drinking sanitation, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on Youtube show young people how they drink a sanitation because of a cheap story.
For years, they have been mixed with oral water containing alcohol for stronger drinks.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the medium.
"Children don't think that it could hurt them," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (sanitary means) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary means with the smell of juice, greep or orange, which are very attractive to children.
The sanitary agent contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, it can mean alcohol poisoning for several years.
"It's a high-concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, a doctor at the University of Kansas City Medical Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn’t allow a glass of whiskey to eat just so, but people leave these sanitation out and when children get to them, it’s a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently shot up to four branches of a sanitation agent with the smell of a juice and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol levels were .179, which is twice the threshold value considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke unclear words and was unable to walk after she arrived in an emergency.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell down and hit her head because of alcohol, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaijah.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange the sanitation of children’s reach.
Except for alcohol poisoning, some sanitation agents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after the collapse of a sanitation medication containing toxic, undeclarated ingredients.
Doctors believed that the product contains methanol, a mortal agent, rather than ethanol, which was indicated as the active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in Northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products throughout the room, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and bans their presence in the room.
Police assessed the distorted plan as "innocent pressure," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fama: No conflict in the Celtic team
Griffiths battelitically talks about a disobedience in Celtic, while Deila admits Hoops are in the wrong place, but he will turn it back.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their mass over Celtic by 5 points
The penalty for the first half in ADAMA Rooney's submission secured Aberdeen's close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, which led Dons to a five-point crossing between him and Celtic.
Griffiths refuses to talk about disobedience
This situation led to disagreement in Celtic, which was denied by Griffiths, which insists that he and his co-players are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for the match against the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're feeling pressured, I think the players are pleased.
Deficiency in Scotland's title rival Nudi Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently ambassador to Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers anymore.
People here don't just talk about the return of Rangers.
They're talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together and they're just interested in that.
At the Old Company’s matches there is great tension and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'm turning things back to good, Deila is committed.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a bit crushed, but the Norwegian boss committed to turning things back to good.
Malm’s defeat and subsequent defeat from the Champions League were quickly followed by the defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players, and now climbed on the top of a five-point board.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced a bad period and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and many people are really, really angry or sad with the current event.
We're all the same, but we have to go further.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it is very important to stay with one another.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcement
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and pointed out that he had already identified some of his January goals, boss Rangers Mark Warburton is worried about the great shopping and does not want to disrupt the team's unity from Ibrox.
Ex-Chef Brentford said: "The people's transgression window is very different from the summer."
Players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season period of residence, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage occurs by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
The Transitional Goal of Celticu Michu indicates retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, who was connected to Celtic in the transition window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
A 20-year-old shooter has been in trouble for two years and has failed to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dress and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on the defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the arbitrator Collum, which was appealed.
Neilson stands behind his claim, saying, "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
He was strictly punished after he admitted to sing a song with a text aimed at former player Hearts Rudolph Skácel.
The incident took place in a Roserburn hospital in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a moment of excitement," the attacker said and continued, "I can safely say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless it's in the Celtic clothing."
The Tannadice Council believes in Dundee United management - Donelly
Simon Donelly continues to believe that the Dundee United Council still believes in correcting the situation by the current team management - but admits that the fall on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
"We're preparing the boy again for the action," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes loves a "great victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately hold against Hamilton Accies in order to succeed in achieving the seventh league victory and a five-pound score in front of the Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half in giving Adam Rooney.
McInnes said, "There is no team that won anything, whether a cup or a league without winning this kind of match."
Scotland’s unemployment remains unchanged, while UK’s overall unemployment increases
The number of unemployed in Scotland remains unchanged between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10 000 to 1,82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the UK rate (5.5%), according to data from the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over the period of three months, the number of workers now stopped to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter, which is over the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan has put the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year that Scotland made its historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we saw further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment increased, while unemployment declined.
Why I was a witness to a murder in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I'll watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope that this will not happen, I'll sit in the check-in gallery at the Oklahoma State Prison's death chamber and see Richard Glossipe who will be sentenced to death by injections.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day is coming, I'm afraid of it.
So why do I do that?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists have been allowed to follow deaths in America and since there are often more requests than free places, a morbid lottery is conducted to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Anyone who will be chosen will watch the entire execution intact.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossipa and I have created a special passage to him through the months of telephone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk together.
The prison report claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to have a note block and I'm not able to record what I see.
I will have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the coward as it will be told, get access.
I complained of her.
She admitted that "this could make it better," but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
She doesn't tell me what I have to write, and even if she did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
He wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, reporter from Huffington Post, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I've created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His crimes after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of companionship for a crime.
But I believe there is a great likelihood that he is innocent of murder.
I definitely believe that there was no sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, punishment is wrong.
From this point of view, I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a person I love to die with unnecessary death.
Man escaped from Canning River after a police trap
The guard of Canning Valley remained dry after he released the men from the Canning River.
The bet of a man from Peter who ran away from the police didn't leave after he got into the swallowed water only a meter from the policeman who tried to violently overcome him to return to the coast.
The Canning Valley police were called on in an incident crossing Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escape through the Canning River.
But he wasn't far away.
"Stand in the water and repeat 'I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
The guard Lachlan Perhavec just didn’t want to wear the uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and a police negotiation.”
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they escape," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins football champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins moved into the hill to avoid the bus and attempted to float across the Swan River.
His efforts were lost, but inspired by locals to start planning the biatlon of Ben Cousinse.
Peter Moody says the organizers tried to spy him and threaten to end the race
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of attempting to hit him in the stake last year and threatened that he would immediately end the race.
He focused on the organizer and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, and he was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with a delayed defeat of Lady Tatai in the maintenance day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin’s positive cobalt extrusion that he couldn’t explain.
He went to the language about the accusations of spying for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's going to get out of you all at once," Moody said.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I'll go home today and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best for them.
When they start thinking the opposite, I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I should then consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Earlier Moody released in his interview for racing.com bomb that the integrity of the department tried to spy him.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I'm going to appoint - and they offered him a job in my staircases to find out about what's going on in my staircases," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If so, everyone should show their information because they're trying to catch me completely burned up.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current Director-General of RVL, were aware of it at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it becomes a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside the training position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Is I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think yes.
Maybe they need me to take my license and throw me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying will give them the material to think.
But I got a point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will press on them and carry burden on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The frustration of the coach has increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent defeat in it has raised the feeling that he "can have his license hours on the table."
Mood, the most famous for preparing an undefeated Black Caviar champion, marked the treatment rule on the day of the factory as a "musical" after he was applied to the legs with an aluminum cloth or a blade, which is contrary to the rules.
It's against the rules of race.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
Someone of my team wrongly put a blow on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
This could have happened yesterday, and that was also happening.
This happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of obstructions on the day of the factory to which the organizers have already opened the investigation.
That's a joke.
People who create these rules don't know about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this went too far," Moody said.
The Cobram driver who caught was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram on weekends and left after the collision.
The cyclist was flying to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after cars were hit on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver had left without stopping and helping the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia admitted himself to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of no stop in an accident, no assistance and other traffic offences.

Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy returns to rivals for wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, criticized the steps of his players as a "plan setting" by two NRL premiership fans.
Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters coach, said that arbiters allowed Storm players to "wrestl" his players during the controversial victory of Storm at the Sydney Qualifications Final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly stunning note on Strorm after his team won the final qualifications over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, when he called the game as a "surveillance" of the rugby league and according to him two Queensland were not "a lot of wrest."
Bellamy defended the interventions of his players and said they had focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self-confidence because his team is criticized by two head coaches, which may mean they are afraid of being defeated by Storm.
“It’s still coming – I don’t remember Trent Robinson would talk about wrestling when we were defeated 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have changed nothing of our defence system and techniques, in the last few weeks we have just emphasized the contact during the interventions, which has meant turning for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously trains a great team, so he is probably not usual to lose, which could have been a bit of shock for him.
It’s funny how things like this will always come in this year.
Bellamy disregarded Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's team of St George-Illawarra Dragons won in 2010 by playing "new" football.
Wayne is talking about an exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne told him that it wasn't really important.
But now it has a team that can play the style of the game, which seems to him restraining, especially his young backups with their speed.
You would like to play such a football if you have this type of players available.
This opinion he said in 2010 and now he wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backups like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play such a style.
It stimulates me more self-confidence because they say such things because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t even think about us when they were getting to big matches.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the Storm and Roosters match more brackets fell than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos team game was probably good, I didn't see, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were another two attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are pause and non-skinning attempts interesting?
I think that's the agenda.
If we are mentioned, it means that we will definitely meet again in a phase.
Storm has a weekend break and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the prefinal on Saturday evening in AAMI Park. The listings will be on sale from Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gains $200,000 charges for drug charges
A man who faced a possible lifetime holding 40 pounds of cocaine missing from Queensland received a $200,000 credit.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of the five men arrested last month by the federal police looking for 100 pounds of drugs from the Solay yacht that came from South America through Vanuatu and in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was arrested at a meeting with jointly accused at the port in the morning and later met with them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs at Toyota Echo.
Although he faced a potential judgment of experience for the ownership of cocaine of commercial quality, the lawyer Maksimovice made a defense that there is no proof that he would own the whole amount and that he could be completely accidentally and innocent in the coffee shop.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would escape.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," the court said on Wednesday.
In the crown case, the police lied about where they lived.
Mom and non-owner father Maksimovice offered a deposit of $200,000 for his release.
“After reading the strict statements of both persons, it is obvious that the $200,000 deposited case is a real financial burden for them,” said judge Flanagan.
Their efforts alone seemed to be insufficient because the accused had not yet come to court, he warned.
Maksimovic has been charged, provided that he will give up both the Australian and Serbian passport, he will notify the police every day and will comply with the departure ban from 18:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to hit pedophiles to send pictures
Pedofil used the telephone of a 11-year-old girl to take pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as he slept, then login into her on her online chat, where he had a lot of unpleasant photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then looked at her and found her missing the phone and then found her in the hand of Hogg asleep.
She passed through him and before she noticed her mother, she found alarming news.
The police joined and saw five photos, then the analytics computers found the address and discovered "disturbed" searches on the web using expressions to search for children's immoral images.
Hogg later claimed to police that his reason was to "bring pedophiles" on the internet before he "predicted that he was a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he was searching on the computer, but he claims he just wanted to pretend he was a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another.
According to him, he did so that he could put them on.
He claims he jumped over in drunkness and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found news on her phone, she called her mother, she cried and wept.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the accused was then confronted.
The girl was listened and talked about how the accused used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls that looked much younger than he.
Hog, 23-year-old, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, confessed to file a complaint about the acceptance or provision of inappropriate pictures of children on June 14 last year, violated the case conditions on January 25 and failed to be heard before the court on March 24 of this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offences because he could argue that he had no "essential sexual subtext in his crime."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael resigned in October for reports of social workers.
In this case, Hogg was charged, but he was kept in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual offences before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe made a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the stage.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also disregarded by the claims of opposition lawmakers that they received anonymous threats by killing them, warning them against Mr. Mugabe’s defeat during his speech.
Last month, he was recorded and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament, which is the word he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, President of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), said that seven opposition politicians had adopted text messages on their mobile phones with warning not to prevent Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that will not appear, but it is called 'dead'," he told journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned that they know that immunity ends in parliament and that their parliamentary immunity does not work as soon as they get out of parliament.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "objections" about threats to the Members.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its efforts to restructure and save the cost of business services.
HP will be divided into two exchange-coded companies later this year and separate computers and printers from their faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, according to the HP statement.
“This restructuring will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” says Meg Whitman, HP CEO and CEO, who will be headed after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of stores that will help businesses move to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separated company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will "focus on providing uncompetitive integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will be the distribution of the company founded in 1930 by graduates of the Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed Silicon Valley.
HP conducted massive reorganization to manage transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of America’s largest technical companies, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that the firm has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Artet says co-players have to get injured Jack Wilshere in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed Wilshere that it is still September, and if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason to stop playing Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from the perspective of history, his involvement in another summer European championship is obviously uncertain.
The great harm of this newest problem is that Wilshere ended strongly last season after he injured the cat and then again entered the former form during the previous season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It is a wound that requires treatment.
It's not a special thing.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his cats or the injury he suffered before.
This could be purely medical truth because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula here.
The survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. recorded 23 different Wilsher injuries since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he only played in the Arsenal's 65 league matches from the total number of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a built-in circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
“Occasionally, when you come back after the injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time you need to strengthen your body and get a competition,” Wenger says.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am sure he will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is ready to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will probably arrive.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudem instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcotta.
“I’m trying to maintain a balance and let players who need it get rid of it,” Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite of the F-Group, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for the most scary stadium in Europe.
The dynamics were not defeated in a total of 41 matches after they held the "invisible" campaign last season.
On Wednesday night, the stadium crashed with a 3.2 degree Richter earthquake.
That was already in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that the Arsenal has been taught from the last season of the Champions League when he capitalized against Monaco and remains far from hope that the club will lead to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This is huge," Wenger says.
The arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I must be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious teaching about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is in the eyes, especially because of the need for men to open more desperate than ever before, with regard to suicide among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) named 2015 the Year of Men, whose aim is to question a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
In the heart of this struggle, there is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students reporting symptoms of depression found that in the event that the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery were doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not in depression, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half-channel of mental problems.
But in order to work friendship, of course, it must be achieved first.
In this social media communication with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate answer is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything on the memory of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire and gamemaker explained recently, money isn't really buying more luck.
The beauty of the Friends series was for him a source of this idea.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that were shining through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler are often victims, a moment of watching football at comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all the springs of knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually leave their feelings for themselves.
“My listeners’ roles of people who feel depressed or have self-suicide tendencies have actually confirmed that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old word "continue to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the orders that come to my mind when I try to offer a longer-term compensatory mechanism.
It emphasizes little moments in male friendship.
With regard to my task, the outsider's condition on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer network of friends and family.
So, if you’re going to FrendsFest this weekend, organized by Comedy Central station, why don’t you see your friends at a glass in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or when you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile on him and greet him.
You never know what the difference your friendship can do.
The Friends series will be broadcast on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - a total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG overcome Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidim and Edison Cavanim after shooting the band against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in the Champions League and thus helped PSG defeat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the report of the game and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the match on Tuesday and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the Lize of the Champions with a final comfort victory 2-0 against Malmu at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the bracelet less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League, and this player PSG sent French championships for victory, but then dropped several chances until they finally raised their bracelet when Cavani shot the bracelet at the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the team of Paris needed a strong start against Swedish championships, because they focus not only on qualifying for riding wheels, but also on improving their journey to the quarterfinals that they recorded in each of the previous three years.
But although they won three points, it wasn't the classic performance of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic who was lost in front of the door and was later replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
“In the Champions League it’s not easy to win outside or at home, so 2-0 win makes our opponents problems and to look comfortable in the defense is a good start, even though there are things we’ll have to improve with the process of the season,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, however, I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more doors.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of the three changes in the PSG team, who held this weekend the 2-2 run with Bordeaux in Liz 1, but was in the fourth minute shaken by Di Mario.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved the PSG in Europe to a new level after a Manchester United break last month, and showed why he hit Marc Verratti's Malm's defence pass and with a beautiful finish sent the ball behind Johan Wiland to the remote corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected it to start a great PSG victory, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off and entered this stage, came up with 9 internationals in the basic assembly and five defenders and two defeated backups were a heavy rival.
But besides Nikola Djurdjice, who just passed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp's gate in the 34th minute, many did not offer it in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with bad plays and misleading endings, which were not good either from Ibrahimovice, who could not shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shooting came into the network shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, it proved much more appropriate when he came to prepare the chances for his co-players, and that was just from his play when Di Maria sent a coin shooting, which ended in Wilando's army after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally arrived after an hour of the game thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayan headset sent him to the line already the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played him after a player from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all the Malm’s thoughts on the possibility that they could gain something from the match, and only Wiland’s extraordinary operation of great proximity decayed the hope of David Luize and the score remained unchanged even when the shifting Ezequiel Lavezzi’s goal was unrecognized at the end of the match.
The Malmo Age Hareide team coach later admitted that the PSG was a top class over his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only a Swedish league that is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
A goat down for Paris.
It was a fun game for them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion for sales of shares
The heavy-duty giant Glencore, headquartered in Switzerland, has made $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares under its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore stated in its statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a reduction in goods prices, as the Chinese economy’s slowdown reduces demand and crashes slightly through the market.
The issue of rights sent Glencore to the top of the London stock market in early morning stores.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pensions on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent above.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of broader plans to reduce their debt $30 billion, which accumulated about a third
The company sold new shares at the price of 123 pennies per share, which was a 2.4 percent discount on the closure price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
The concerns about the prolongation of Chinese growth have reduced the price of iron red by nearly half and coal, copper and other goods dropped by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
The first visit to President Xi in Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing, where the president was invited in November.
U.S. President and first lady Michelle Obama invited President Xi and his Peng Liyuan to the state dinner, which will be held after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit is an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the United States and China and encourages cooperation in addressing problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on both countries’ disagreements,” the report said.
Xi, whose first visit was announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he meets several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then will continue to New York at the United Nations Lighting Session.
Obama and Xi are expected to solve controversial problems, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyberspionage and its growing aggression in the South China Sea waters.
How the refugee crisis broke out the Schengen area.
The emergency lights that were fired by Germany far did not destroy the European crew, but already forced the ship to change the course, French newspaper Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the issue of refugees: it will rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent, especially in Greece, rather than strive for the future division of refugees by quotas based on quantities that are increasingly distant from reality.
Six days after the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 out of 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, Member States' internal ministers have changed their priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the refugees, first of all, it is necessary to filter those who arrive already today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary for the management of migration," the ministers discussed in Brussels on Monday stressed.
After the Joint Currency crisis, the EU finds it in danger in its further major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but does not lose its decision and increase pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flood of those seeking asylum in the country.
The central power clearly shows that there is no possible free movement in Europe without it.
As a proof, Austria and Slovakia have already joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also consider this, although with different intensity.
Hungaria has been in progress for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible in accordance with the Schengen rules.
It's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, South Italy and also Hungary for those who have already entered the country.
France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière were intensively discussing this during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea isn't a new way, but it's realised.
In Italy, according to informal statistics, two-thirds of newly entered refugees have already been recorded and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because they fear more than others that camps will not remain on her beds, where refugees will gather to their account.
The real black hole remains Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200 thousand people landed this year, twice as much as they arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they passed overflowed camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge diving hole.
Athens, who are still in financial disturbance and are waiting for a new government, have put their hands into the clay.
This is the default point for the Balkan road and the source of common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Juncker's commission promises that checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has not given any number or date.
"The calls faced by Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers said on Monday on the mobilization of the front.
This is why the European Frontex Border Control Agency’s intervention teams will be placed in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen the supervision of the islands.
"There will be a need for adequate financial resources," the text submitted to the Ministers for approval warns.
From the point of view of the law, Athens will continue to be the last word.
The issue of real European border guards was not officially raised, but Europe is approaching this.
The new emergency situation of the eighteenth century, as well as the second round of the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which were established by Juncker's Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year and which were strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it to be an attack on their supremacy.
The number, not the duty, was kept in the text approved by the majority of the eighteen.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise is the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been agreed in June during the EU Hectic Summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead in the Alps, three of which are allegedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed lavina in the French Alps.
The German nationality is also a woman who has survived as one of the eight members of the affected group.
Previous news reports said it was Polka.
A thirty-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a severe bone injury.
According to the AFP, the dead were mostly 40 people.
"The recording event ended, the victim's bodies were also transferred to Briancon to identify," said Hautes-Alpes department prefect Pierre Besnard.
Unfortunately, around noon in the mountain region of Pelvoux under the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 meters.
"The high lavina was 250 metres wide and approximately a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, rescue boss.
According to him, a huge amount of snow has been shaken on the eighth group at an altitude of about 3900 meters.
Today's weather service was unexpected in the area before the weather.
Pacific before the match with Braga: Finally the right Europe.
Trainer Jindřich Trpišovsky, at his premiere in the championship, managed to pass through the European League's preschool to the basic group and is now excited to enjoy true Europe with the team.
The Slovak welcomes the 2011 finalist of Braga and, according to her, wants to introduce her game style.
After all the nerves in the striking struggles, when every goal and every situation could drive you out on the way to the striking group, we are now there and we will play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every incapsulated branch, we can play our tactics and we aren’t bound by just twins.
"I look forward to it and it's a real Europe, it was just qualification before," Trpišovsky said at the press conference.
Bragu is considered the top team.
They will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may even be harder to have no such name, but in his car, he has a player who has given Manchester three goals.
"It's an excellent overall at top team level," Trüpišovski said.
He doesn't think he's a good favorite.
I'll take it by playing at home, so I'm sure we're not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong at our stadium in the home competition and in the predecessors, and we want to confirm that," said a coach whose team lost from eleven duels of this season only the introduction Super Cup in Plzni.
He believes that the Liberec will be able to introduce his style as well.
We are waiting for a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is only untypically disciplined for them.
Playing from 4-4-2 separation with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"It's a very heavy opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the ground," Trpišovsky said.
We studied a lot of competitors in the previous schools, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also customized training.
"And we certainly want to, even though it will be very demanding to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films will control the sand, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have signed their works this year to the 15th anniversary of the International Film Festival of Students in Pisa.
Four dozens of them, a commission made up of students and pedagogs, will be held in the film Portyč from 15 to 18 October.
The best of them chooses an international court, said the spokesman of the festival Jakub Charvát.
Every year, the festival has its own special topic, which depends on the festival soundtrack.
It's a detective this year.
This year’s festival director Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine the elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course, we also have to resolve the crime that has been committed in our this year's warrior," Charvát said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
It will be assessed by an international court, in which, for example, last year's winner, Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo, and British producer Hemant Sharda will meet.
The organizers of the festival, like every year, prepare a accompanying program.
The Wattican Punk Ballet comes from Armenia, singer Ondrzej Ruml, a professional player at didgeridoo Ondrzej Smeykal, turbosanson group Summer?, plays the Cape Grain or, for example, Petra Hapková with a recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two exhibitions of photography.
The first brings the graduate of the Song Film School and the prestigious award holder, including the missing from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition approaches the atmosphere that ruled in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
In a speech with visitors, cameraman and documentary Martin Čech, whose film The Cameraman is accompanied by his music Gerhard Gruber and singers Brukner, Novotný and Sound at the theater of the artist Jan Novotný’s new book of three friends from P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron of FAMO in Pisa, who recently left us.
Our schools and festivals are the link that will continue to live.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film work," the spokesman said.
This will certainly help Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, graduate several jobs at a time and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of a private high school of films in Picasso.
Her founders, the wives of Vladan and Milan Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
He held up to the sixth year once every two years.
When CK falls, insurance companies must pay full customer claims.
Insurance companies should pay customer claims when the travel office falls in full.
She decided on this Wednesday in the House when she adopted an amended novel of the business conditions in tourism law.
The travel offices will be able to replace insurance against the fall by a bank warranty, according to the proposal to be assessed in the Senate.
Insurance companies with an obligation to pay customer claims even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development is on the adjustment, argued consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end travel agencies' insurance against crash when the novel is paid.
The proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they must either end or go abroad.
The Ministry of Local Development Karla Šlecht (for the UN) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full refunds are not euro-compliant.
She noted this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the customer has the right to fully refund the money regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive enough information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, Šlechta stressed.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be implementable," said TOP 09 Vice President Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank warranty does not work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel offices will have to end their activity or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and the Tomio Okamura Agency (SPD) with concerns of Kalousk on the basis of a survey between the CK members did not agree.
"Stop showing us lobbing insurance," he said.
The statements of the insurance companies do not consider Okamura relevant, nor do the official written statements thereof exist in this sense.
They say, however, whether travel offices will participate, which is not a problem according to Okamura.
Jan Fischer (ODS) was also warned before the provision, referring to the opinion of the Competitive Association of the Czech Tourism Offices, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs with the Czech Tourism Offices.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” Fischer said.
The House did not approve her proposal for the release of the disputed passport.
Neither did Vojtěch Philip (KSČM) propose to return the proposal to the committee due to the alleged contradiction with the civilian law.
Philip warned travel agencies that could threaten consumers.
In view of the Constitutional Court’s charter, the rapporteur Martin Berdych (ANO) has withdrawn his proposal, which would limit the responsibility of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that insurance enforcement does not cover the entire risk.
The novel will not initially propose a minimum of four million insurance limit for travel offices offering air traffic tours, and a million limit for offices selling bus tours, for example.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the scheduled markets from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of insurance will have to be such that, in the event of the fall of the travel office, it covers all the customer’s claims.
Even after the modifications, the norm states that the travel agencies will need to specify newly for sales tours which the travel office is organizing.
Travel offices will have to submit to insurance companies before the contract is concluded, among other things, information on the management and the number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Committee of Public Administration shall also be calculated with further regular information on insurance companies.
The travel offices will have to provide them monthly information about the number of travellers and travellers sold, the total price of travelling sold and the amount of returns and markets for travel and signs for them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of the legal obligations against the insurance company, it will invite it to correct or will be able to ban it to conclude new contracts in the event that a violation of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
Novela also needs to change the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of grants for mountain service on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The application will contain a report on the use of state funds last year, a financial plan of expenditure and a prospectus for the next two years.
According to the association, the lawmaker did not realize what would happen if the insurance company concluded the CK contract.
It will not be afraid to organize the tours and customers who purchased the tour before the cancellation of the insurance will come to it according to the association.
In this case, CK suffers significant loss and may even distort, although its management was in good condition.
One of the options in which travel agencies can deal with such a situation will be the complaint for a refund.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and we will act only as agencies on our market, the Vice-President of the Association Jan Papaž said.
According to him, the draft novel also includes a bank warranty, but so unthinkably that it cannot be implemented in practice, as the bank warranty cannot sound to an unlimited amount.
According to the association, the change in current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Over the course of two years, it will be necessary to revise the entire law in view of the new EU Directive.
The Czech market currently operates a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
This year, only three CKs have been ended.
Home travel agencies sell tours annually worth around £20 billion.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union has to make it possible to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after negotiating with German Prime Ministers.
At the same time, she reiterated the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU between the eighteenth Member States.
We need to help more countries where refugees are leaving, or where they are residing after leaving the country.
I am expecting a signal from the European Union to put on decent conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal could be even higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organizations.
"The federal countries also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis on European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, Braniborska Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at the press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
Refugee distribution in the EU on the basis of quotas for the long term rejects, among other things, the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also expressed themselves to accelerate the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know if they have a chance to stay here as soon as possible.
It is also necessary for the authorities to begin with the integration of foreigners faster, the Prime Minister of branibor said.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends to take care of refugees must also be used to integrate those who have the chance to obtain asylum.
More teachers will be needed to manage Germans.
It is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if refugees are able to integrate, they can be a benefit for us,” he said.
Matt Damon Batterys Diversity and Film
Matt Damon confronted African filmmaker Effie Brown during a diversity discussion with the claim that this was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO’s Greenlight project, an actor occupied in the Brown series stopped, emphasizing the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the scenario.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it by holding a movie, not by holding a show,” Damon says.
Shocked, she reacted badly to Brown with unconfidence and delayed "Hey! Wow. Okay," when comments on Martin were received to broadcast.
Damon and Brown joined commonly known producer Ben Afflec and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalist show.
"I would like to call people to think whether they're the director of what they're behaving for the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that is a shark that is packed by a white belt.
Producer of Dear White People promoted finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to directed a film; Damon concluded that their directors "to finally give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was dismissed, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon’s comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger for writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black man in the room so he can explain to her that the diversity is so much that it hurts."
Tweet has acquired more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 people from the time it was published.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is in front of social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national effect and pushed the lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince made a move hits, while nominated in the album category of the year during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, the album is still important.
The latest leader of the Black Lives Matter Movement presented a statement in response to Fox News personality question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leader said.
Damon was recently listed on a list of tastings, producers, and media who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss showing the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not clear whether the invitation has been accepted or has already met the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional horor and cockroach Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home a million dollars.
In the competition that just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the barriers on the track.
During the final season, two men went to the last wheel, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second slide over more than 220 m long lane.
Britten was the first to win the match and became the first competitor to overcome the four-second match in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overcame him for three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero interviewed the reportE! News immediately after his severe triumph, and it was known that he was still in shock with the winning major prize worth $1 million.
“It’s a wonderful feeling I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” said Isaac E! in response to his victory.
“So suddenly... I can’t imagine what it is now.”
Executive producer Kent Weed interviewed The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won no awards despite becoming the first competitor to finish the race.
According to the rules, money belongs to the person who finishes the loss fastest.
"If more competitors participate in the race, the winner will win with the best time," Weed said.
Although the main wins would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don’t think he’d have a famine in him.
He was glad he was able to achieve what he was able to do.
He received a warm welcome from his fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
It's a hero for my children and women."
Geoff said to me, "If there were someone who could defeat me, I would like to be Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same.
America Ninja Warrior will continue in the eighth season, which will be recorded in spring 2016.

Xi calls for the opening of the economy to a broader world
It is necessary to open the economy to a broader world to strengthen growth, said Xi Jinping, whose task is to reform the management on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investments and expertise and improve open policy," he said on the 16th meeting of the Central Leader Group to deepen the overall reform.
Promotion of opening up in parental reforms will give new impulse and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Head of the Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policy, the support of state undertakings (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the registration residential system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up, identifying sectors and companies outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programmes.
This step is important as it will give the market a greater role in allocation of resources, ensuring the legal entrepreneurial environment and making the market more open, the statement states.
The government will also release power controls that delegates to companies and ensure that companies themselves will decide how to manage their businesses.
The statement also states that China will allow the border area to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new regional growth support mechanisms.
In an attempt to open the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investments.
"The government will not change its policy against foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and will provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to request permission for permanent stay or a "green card," thanks to optimizing requirements and simplifying the application process.

The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Chief Executives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
There may be a new bed department in the Karlsruhe.
According to the town hall of the Karlovar region of Jakuba Panika (ČSSD), the current capacity of bed divisions of two country hospitals and two private hospitals in the country are sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between individual hospital divisions.
In the country there are also possibilities of enlargement of care.
For example, in the Department of Surgery, a single-day surgical centre could be established, where, according to the defined concept, the performance of surgical fields that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be carried out.
In which specific hospitals the workplace should be focused on one-day surgery, it is still unclear.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital, there could be a laser center with the possibility of using laser technique for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an aphalic center that would take care of patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-co-resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility to concentrate such a facility into the Isle of Hospital where similar care is already available.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovar region, is the post care bed, especially the long-term treatment bed (LDN), whose capacity in Nidka is insufficient and above all should be closely linked to the bed of acute care.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, it recommends the concept.
As he notes, the post care bed is missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There will be the use of abandoned buildings after centralization.
Lastly, in the Karlovar region, there are no socially health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are inadequate throughout the republic, so they can serve for other countries as the so-called Alzheimer’s Center.
Hospitals should also be prepared for the introduction of so-called consecutive beds to grant European grants.
"This is a bed that will be linked to the areas of super-specialized care and will form a space for the translation of patients after the intervention, for example, after cardiovascular, neurosurgery, transplant or other intervention," the country's bed care concept describes.
New services can also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
