Barack Obama won the fourth U.S. Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Norway for 26 hours to take the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth U.S. President in history.
A diploma, medal, and a $1.4 million check will be given, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The boss of the White House will arrive in the morning to the Norwegian metropolis with his wife Michelle and will be filled.
She first attends the Nobel Institute, where for the first time she meets five members of the committee, which was chosen in October by 172 people and 33 organizations.
The President has a planned meeting with King Harald V and Queen Sonjo.
In the afternoon, the visit will be celebrated by a ceremony to which Obama will take over the prestigious awards.
He gets him as the fourth U.S. president, but only the third one who gets the prize directly at the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when it comes to appreciation.
The President does not want to avoid this, because he realizes that the prize is taken as a president who is currently warring in two countries.
A few days ago, war efforts increased by sending further units to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize any of his critics.
At the Obama ceremony, he will also receive gold medals, diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
They are planned to do good, but he has not yet decided on specific charity.
It will then introduce a banket, where besides the king of Norway and the queen, there will be also a ministerial president and another 250 invited guests.
Obama has been restrained from the beginning to the price.
For example, he said he felt like he didn’t deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not only for him, but for those who strive for the same value as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he said he was "a call for action."
The defendant of nature is accused of pressing
The Lithuania Police accused the President of the Civil Association of the Lithuania Association of Nature Protectors of the Lithuania.
In several cases last year he appealed to some construction proceedings, demanding money from investors for his benefit, Litomere police spokesman Alena Romová said.
The President of the Litomeric Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in jail and threatened for up to three years of jail.
Brno's classified containers don't call
In Prague, ordinary people can classify packaging from beverages, and in the southern Moravia villages you will meet classifying containers at every step.
What about Brno?
There you can book a few minutes before you find the right cabins.
I don’t want to say that the waste wouldn’t be at all in Brno.
But I think that the fact that we are the second largest city in the Republic is insufficiently interested in this problem.
In the washing league, the classification of waste is not only by throwing only paper, glass and plastic into the classroom containers, but mostly the number of waste waste.
Have you ever tried to throw PET bottles in the center, for example?
It's a finished chest, especially it needs time and fixed nerves.
The only place I’ve hit until now is on the Moravsky Square in front of Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderk and his colleagues break me, but I'm a little bit fucking going on.
Not to mention that in other parts there is no honey classification of waste.
Many of my friends prefer not to classify waste.
From the league.
They are far away from the perfections.
I don't surprise them.
After the celebration I offered myself to throw a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I haven't seen any colorful bathtubs on Kounico's street.
Fortunately, I hit the right place on the way to the shit.
However, the waste came from him.
It’s still the center of Brno, which is probably the most represented by the city, isn’t it?
However, the ecosystem and some aesthetics of Brno socialists are not very interested.
These cities prefer to buy a hockey extra-liggage that will make us a disappointment throughout the republic rather than buy a few containers in addition and offer the classification of other raw materials for the cleaner Brno.
I’m glad I could confirm my opinion after a moment of browsing on the internet by official statistics.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
"Paroubkov" budget took money for retirement and sickness
After the left has added to farmers or officials despite the government’s opinion, the budget may not have funds for retirement, sickness or construction savings.
But also on interest from government debt or international judicial disputes.
This will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of the year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists promoted the increase of some groups, they relyed on the government to borrow additionally on sensitive expenditure, pensions or illness. "It's just a delay of problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
In fact, more and more interest rates are paid from loaned money and sometimes have to be returned.
There is no choice where to take it, the state.
If they do not reduce social allowances or the cost of the state, they must raise taxes.
He added to all the left ones: to the hammers, to the teachers, to the farmers.
And later their children.
Retirement or illness, from which 1.8 billion has disappeared, people don’t have to be afraid to get them.
However, for the sake of becoming more debt – next year, it will not be missing only 163 billion in cash, but more.
In spite of the efforts of the Minister of Justice, the debt is growing faster and with him and the interest costs.
The State will need money for its pay and will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT or reduce maternal income, as the government did in its counter-deficiency package.
Due to the transfers of money for several groups of voters next year, five billion will also be missing for the construction of roads and railroads.
These are mainly competitive and dismantled sections that are redesigned and, if necessary, not dismantled.
The best thing to do is keep, which is not free too.
This means a delay or a stop of thirty large buildings, a European money pumping is also threatened, the spokeswoman of the transport ministry Karel Hanzelk warned.
The Czechoslovakia proposed that the loss of money would be solved in Shalamoun – it compares to the CHEZ dividend, which the state mostly owns, and from them the transport funds are incurred.
The problem is that the sum of the dividend is never sure, and it is no longer a source.
Last year, 18 billion people arrived in the Czech Republic.
Annually, the liquidation of ecological damages is paid from the dividend, supplemented by a pension account or served as a reserve for a pension reform.
In addition, this trick under EU rules increases the actual budget deficit to a level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
The carnival does not end.
Nearly three billion people have been in the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and criminal offences or expenditure on judicial disputes, even on construction savings.
If the money is covered without that, it's not sure.
That's a lottery.
"If we lose any international dispute, we will have to pay it equally," Janota said.
The minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, pay the government’s budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing on the already expanded two-billion project of the State Treasury, which is intended to allow online monitoring for what individual authorities spend.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions would come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
In the future, Americans count on a mobile phone, on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
The unveiled plans sound promising.
Just press one key, and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android in a few seconds.
This option is the target of the American VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles at once on your mobile.
You can switch between them, divide them into home and work.
They will both work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has successfully presented a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was adapted to the Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously operated Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full power.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and customers should get the devices in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains suffers hotelers
The holes do not worry only about the crushers.
The missing snow also reflects people from ordering skiing stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, free rooms are still available in Krkonoši for all winter dates including Christmas and Silvestra.
We have a great visit to our website.
People go through offers, see prices, but still fear to order.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask if we believe Christmas will be on snow or on flowers this year,” said the operator of the Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants a silvestrovsky stay in Špindlero Mlýna precisely according to his thoughts should no longer pay the order.
Who prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is at him until the second place, the one can still try for a few days to wait.
The Spandlerov hoteliers are currently mostly only offering a weekly stay in Silvestra.
I think they will try to marry them for a while, but then they will allow and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will soon grow up," Jandura said.
The free bed at all winter times still offers the top-class travel office of Ingtours.
We are most interested in the Christmas week that hasn’t been sold yet.
Half of the places in our offer remain free.
That is why we have already made some cheaper Christmas stays in the last minute,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonoších may also offer the top-class travel office, but there are fewer free places.
Good for the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoších.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If the trails are snowed over the week, Christmas will also be sold out," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, there is something better than the vessels to include the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Peci sub Snežká.
We're about 5% better.
We have the last few places at Silvestra and Christmas.
It is a great interest in Poland’s holidays in January and it’s well sold in February,” said the director of the best peak hotel Karel Rada.
Of eighty percent of silvestres are also occupied by the Omnia hotel at the central parking lot in Janské Leszních.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain free at the latest Janskolan hotel at Christmas.
This year, we were surprised by January, which is already about sixty percent.
It is slightly weaker until February, but as soon as the snow attacks, the interest in staying in Krkonoších will certainly rise, said Omnia Erik Sporysch, director of the hotel.
However, for a larger snow park, the hotel owners still have to take a taste.
It will be cooled on Thursday, if there is any rainfall, snow should be on the mountains.
But then the heating will come again, Jiří Jakubský from the workplace of the Czech hydrometeorological institute informed.
U.S.: Repeat is a Mother of Wisdom
It is just comic, with what school effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan issue of the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself considered the most stupid.
When he finally exposed his desired Afghan doctrine, it turned out to be recorded by a copy of Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not only uses the dictionary "as in Iraq" several times in the same text, but even refused to use Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "The New Way forward".
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military forces to Iraq under the Civil War as “unresponsible and in its consequence disastrous decisions.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of Polish commanders was the only possible and successfully so far that they are not talking about Iraq at all today.
Bush’s reputation did not improve unless objectively left his successor much more grateful than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was asked to increase the military quota again by field commanders, particularly Afghan Operations Commander General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinate habits, severely criticized a massive shooter in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for better.
The President took a three-month weight, but he did not get better, so at least the general of ten thousand soldiers.
He was able to make a promise of another 5,000 from Europe, although he initially counted at least 10.
The most problematic in the entire Obama strategy appears to be his intention to start the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than answers.
Many doubt that the half increase will give the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the brutal war in recent years, the Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreement.
The situation in Afghanistan is a contrary sign - no one can rely on and no agreements are met.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are used to change the lords every day according to their suit.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a dark village that will continue to have patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is incredibly complex due to the intransparency of the proportions that complicate the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
Neither building an "accessible state", which is a minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem too realistic.
The time horizon of the Obama Strategy involves its volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the edge of the explosion.
Believing in the fact that the soldiers sent to the war in order to "the quick return of home" will cause a miracle done here, only the soul can really be romantic, in fact not touched.
From the political point of view, the determination of the date of the withdrawal of the army is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect recognition of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the willingness of Europeans to participate in fighting operations in Afghanistan is misleading.
European politicians cannot and want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is associated with the war in the underground of Hindukush.
Another factor capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to worse, and the reinforced sanctions on Iran do not affect, there will be an overwhelming issue before the United States, seemingly not to try to solve the problem with the military force.
It will be necessary to answer it just when, according to Obama, America will reach the winner download from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turning in the Afghan situation.
The only strike for Barack Obama is that there are three years left in presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to come with another strategy if it appears to be a total loss.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers will no longer receive cash rewards
The U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that thus responds to the acute criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading managers will receive money instead of shares, which will be possible to sell at the earliest time in five years.
In addition, shares can be taken from managers if they are at excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to Reuters, is heading for a long-term awards on Wall Street.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to be outlined, JPMorgan Douglas Elliott’s former investment banker said.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became the first criticism after giving the party nearly $17 billion ($300 billion) in the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the company’s total rewards for this year will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measures announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector with the arrival of the financial crisis have become a hot political issue in a number of countries.
The UK on Wednesday announced that the intentional bonuses of bankers exceeding £25,000 (about £712,000) would be charged at a single time with fifty percent taxes.
Similar steps are also made by France.
This year women have won the Nobel Prize in all areas except physics
Today, five record women in Stockholm took the Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature by King Charles XVI of Sweden.
In addition to four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Hert Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded by two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider along with their countryman Jack Szostak for chromosome research.
The prize for chemistry was received by Israel, Ada Jonath, along with American Venkatran Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitzem for clarifying the structure and function of ribosoms.
The latter was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economy, won by American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that took place this year without the owner was physics.
This prize was taken today by scientists Charles Kao for optical fiber research and George Smith and Willar Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxs or astronomical telescopes.
Each awarded received a diploma, a Nobel Medal and a financial award certificate.
The one in each category reaches ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more in each of them, the reward is divided among themselves.
The most traditionally unexpected Nobel Peace Prize has already been received by President Barack Obama in Oslo in the afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, because it was only at the beginning of his path and, in addition, stands in the head of a country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his policies, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to eliminate peace, although the price for it is high.
Minister Janot considers demission. Klaus invited him to the Temple
President Václav Klaus will adopt finance minister Eduardo Janot on Friday morning, who considers settlement in the government because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for next year, as approved by the Parliament on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janoto's establishment in the cabinet will be subject to their Friday meetings.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
He says it has too much deficit, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
The meeting was informed by President’s spokeswoman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to work with Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which will now get Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should finance with a deficit of 163 billion kroons.
However, the House agreed on Wednesday with the proposals of the left to move money and increased the money on the wages of state employees, on the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has suggested that the proposals of social democracy are secretly increasing the deficit of the budget.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, there was a sharp intrapolitical dispute on the other hand, which began to raise a questionnaire over the further action of Fischer’s official cabinet, on which the formation of the ODS, the Czechoslovakia and the Green Party were agreed in the spring.
The critics argue that the budget, as it adopted by the House, is essentially eliminating a package of savings that Fischer's government had taken in the autumn and which, according to it, has to stop the State debt.
Claus, which the State Budget Act may, but also may not sign, today's breakfast with entrepreneurs, declared that politicians for a longer period of time have ignored a "sensitive problem" which is a "insurgent deficit" of public finances.
He says he has no better solution today.
It could only bring improvements to a strong government that could further rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the President said.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is terrifying and the government should consider further existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said the Czech Republic’s official cabinet concept with the support of the Czech Republic, the ODS and the Greens is no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "powerful statements".
Chief of the Czech Republic, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolanka, saying that a terrifying budget deficit that the former government of Topolanka prepared for this year will exceed 200 billion crowns.
The Czech Republic has already signed the approval of the state budget for the next year for success.
People were also satisfied.
Clint Eastwood's Mandel was played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victory despite some criticism that American actors play the main role.
The story tells about sports, racial relationships and Nelson Mandel.
The tired fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first Black President Nelson Mandel in his life story is the Oscar-American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, a twenty-year-old, asked him if he could create it in Eastwood's film.
Another important role in it is Matt Damon.
I said to him, "When I play you, I will have access to you.
The twenty-year-old actor who won a prize for the role in Eastwood's drama in the box of the Million Dollar Baby has already created, for example, a leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he finally became a slave, a fictional president of the United States and even a god in God’s Evan, but only a few are so important for someone who lives still.
Former South African citizen was 27 years in prison for his active work to end the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for non-defeated and is the name of English poem author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The picture is a true story about how Nelson Mandela combined forces with the South African ragby team captain Francois Pienar to help unite the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains racial and economically divided after the apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite ragby players that belong to the world of outsiders.
The South African team will finally join the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on the plate.
I had no other goal than to play this role to get it as close as possible to reality,” Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandella, to join him, to be in a curiosity before his speech.
The most important thing was that Mandel wanted to shake his hands.
I found that when I print your hand, I pick up your energy, it moves, and I had the feeling I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon creates in the film Françoise Pienaar, captain of the national ragby team in which white players were overseen.
He said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of ragby.
A great surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienar in his house.
I remember when I called for a home sound, he opened me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real performances under the leadership of Eastwood, Invictus: The Undefeated positive reviews and also talk about the ambitions of the Oscar.
Todd McCarthy, a film critic of Daily Variety, summarised his comments in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76% of positive reviews.
The Secrets of the Fire of Norway Dispatched: Russians Tested the Rocket
Over Norway it was possible to observe a special lighting effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defense admitted yesterday that the intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian borders.
The start was once again failed and a shooter named the "Bulava" type, which was originally the glory of the Russian army, slowly becoming a black bullshit of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in missile tests did not have a proper effect on the success of testing flights.
The bulav usually did not fly or damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already written as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly but lights
The 13th attempt was initially normal.
At the end of the flight there was again technical damage to the device.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time, "Bulava" started from the atomic navy Dmitri Donskiy, which sailing below the White Sea level.
This type of missile allows shooting from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time beaten.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was actually "Bulava".
From the first time, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are preventing this time and arguing that it is not possible to speak clearly about failure.
The first two stages of missiles have endured and the accident has reached up to the third.
In previous cases, the engines were immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the test starts have been completed completely without a failure, only six out of the thirteen defence ministry have failed.
Almost fifty percent of the success of the generals therefore fills with optimism and still claims that Bulava will fly once without problems and that it will even take up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract at CSKA Moscow in 51 years
The legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey game at 51 years old.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and holder of Stanley Cup will help in the emergency of his CSKA Moscow team and will appear to be in the KHL duel on Friday against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who finished his career in the forty years in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš's injury, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We just need to resolve some formal matters, cited the AP club of the Moscow club Sergei Germaninov.
It’s not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will be about only one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, the Germans said.
According to AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player in the case of returning to the ice.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for the fifty years after the legendary Hartford attacker Gordie Howe and joined 15 goals and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic golds, seven World Champions titles, triumphing at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he doubled the Stanley Cup head in Detroit.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Fair.
Hyundai has agreed to trade unions. Cancels all over time
The Hyundai car driver agreed to cancel all over time with the trade unions.
Just because of the frequent overtimes, trade unions declared an emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by car spokesman Hyundai Petr Vanék.
However, the leadership wants to agree with the trade unions on another Saturday exchange this year.
We can’t give up our production plan, which is essential, so it was planned a voluntary vacation on Saturday, December 19, with the fact that two exchanges were made, Vanek said.
Server Semička.cz wrote that the company of employees who process the Saturday exchange offered a bonus of £400.
The people will receive it back for work Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate employees for the proposed overtime.
They either have to pay the fee for an overtime, or they can choose a replacement vacation on December 28, and so they will be able to extend the Christmas holidays on December 28, he said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday exchange will receive paid tickets and lunch.
Since the overseas were the most urgent and flammable point of view of the comments and complaints of trade unions, and the protesters, who have stopped the production lively last week, the leadership decided with immediate validity to cancel all of the overseas during the month.
By last week, the car employees were forced to work almost every day after an eight-hour exchange for another two-hour overtime.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions are appealing for emergency
Further negotiations between car management and trade unions will take place on Friday morning.
Petr Cooker, Chairman of the Committee, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the emergency.
The situation in the car worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees stopped spontaneously due to constant overtimes.
They also protested against bad pay conditions and alleged shit.
The government insisted that over time employees must do to meet the car delivery requirements.
In their Monday announcement, trade unions also requested that they were not imposed by any sanctions by employees who stopped production on Wednesday.
In the field of time, trade unions after the company require to minimize the time work.
They also want to pay the prize of 5,000 krones this year.
The Hyundai car currently employs 2,000 people.
The company distributed the series in November last year.
By September this year, about 80,000 cars were produced, with their current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also takes on HIV's 'called' viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the organism.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it takes even the viruses that have already obtained against immune drugs.
In some cases, this fact overcomes the fact that the compound on the usual variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some of the already available medications.
AIDS has not yet been healed.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the reproduction of HIV in the body.
However, their use is associated with a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus is also the result of the development of so-called resistent viruses against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Czech Academy of Sciences, the VCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarborane are responsible for the multiplication of the HIV protein.
Metalocarbonates are compounds of pipe, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus unlike all medicines used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metalocarbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-state cylinders formed by the atoms of bore, hydrogen and carbon are connected by a metal atom, in this case with a cobalt.
Trailed and resistant virus
HIV protein is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease caused by HIV swelling, mature infectious viral particles would not occur.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences in the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of clays (see table) are linked to a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV-protease substances has been tested in coughing and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect for the resistant variants against which the drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications from metalocarborons make interesting compounds for further research aimed at designing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Řezáčová, the Head of Laboratory of Structural Genetics of the Academy of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry Institute.
The ODS went to Fischer, who prevented
ODS Chief Mirek Topolánek marked the approved budget for the next year as a "terrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The ODS expressed the President of the Government as strong statements.
He says he has no time to analyze.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the Czech Republic, the ODS and the Green Party is no longer working.
The President of the Government has to decide whether the parliament intends to rely on a minority that is dealing with the growing deficit or whether it is going to remain in office with the help of parliamentary left.
The access to ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas noted.
The parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with the Left Amendments for over 12 billion kroons.
The House increased the money on the wages of state employees, on the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The result of the government’s proposals for social democracy was that they hiddenly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kroons.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, fulfilling the government’s desires that even the amended budget is less bad than the budgetary commission.
disappointment and miserableness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would still evaluate the current situation.
It is uncomfortable that if Janota seriously threatened the resignation of the function in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could seem different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He also pointed out that he considers another reservoir in the function.
The reason is his disappointment in the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for further fighting against the budget deficit, they have nothing in the government to do with the nominators of the Czechoslovakia, which have made changes to the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will give a resignation if the House approves additional deficit laws, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or a new service law.
Topolánek: Ministers of ODS Nomination do not pronounce
This is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS nomination ministers did nothing wrong, Topolánek emphasized in a US text message.
He recalled that there are people in local offices who voted against the budget in TOP 09.
Some time emphasized that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of fighting the public deficit, "it's totally logical and correct that he'll take care of the left majority, which is currently in the House."
He said he could not count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it's up to date, I'm going to devote myself to it," said Minister of Defense Martin Bartak to reporters in the House, who was just nominated by civil Democrats in the government.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer went to the European Council’s negotiations in Brussels.
At the request of the ODS Prime Minister resigned
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would obviously vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House, unless the Prime Minister of the Democrats expressly asked to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not look like orphans, we are not small children, and then responded to the question of whether the ODS did not challenge the absence of the President of the Party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on budget.
I didn't notice that my voice was missing.
When I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about Bolshevik and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek responded.
According to the new rule of law, less trains are going for almost the same flight.
The Czech roads will be cancelled or restricted from December 13, some less stressed speeds and locals, and other connections will, on the contrary, be reinforced.
The total volume of transport will decrease by two percent from the date of validity of the new schedule compared to today.
Most rates including basic and customer journey will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostravska get more opportunities to connect to the capital, and the roads on this line add one pendolino system.
On the contrary, the speed stops driving to Bratislava.
Less speeds are also going on the route Prague - Pike - Czech Budějovice, which is essentially limited by direct connections Prague - Letohrad.
From the regions, the routes plan the largest reduction of transport in the Krakowhradska region, a total of eight per cent, on the contrary, the growth can be enjoyed by Prague and its surroundings.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - Tabor - Czech Budějovice and the operation of several speeds on the route Prague - Sand - Czech Budějovice is limited to only a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of new direct lines from Milovic to Prague, which today must be transferred to Lysé nad Lab.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko municipality system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electricity route from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital will end at Prague Main Station target station.
SC Pendolino connects between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Shumperka/Jesenieka will be in two-hour intervals.
Pendoline to Bratislava is no longer travelling since December 13th.
This year's regional rail account: about 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport has ordered and paid rapidly, with a total payment of the so-called demonstrable losses to the dear next year, as well as this year. Locals are ordering countries, with a total of eight billion crowns for them next year, with a total of three billion countries contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
In locals and accelerators, the roads have a new decade-long contract, so far the contract has always been one year.
Others praise the system, and therefore, obviously, they failed to increase the prices of the roughest majority of tickets.
Changes will only happen for one-day network tickets and cheap online tickets for eLiška.
For travellers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will rise from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLišky will be newly dependent on the detained distance, so far it was united for the journey between any country towns and made 160 crowns.
More than 50 people are still detained by Filipino armed forces, children are released
Weapons have taken 75 people to the south of the Philippines, including several primary school students and their teachers.
It was reported by the AFP, which initially reported only 65 detained.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours including one teacher.
It took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Around 19 armsmen said they used arms as a live shield while fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remainder.
According to the AFP, armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is armed by the Philippine Communist Party (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police initially persecuted the kidnappers because of violence that demanded the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, Maguindanao province, a recent massacre that killed 57 people was declared a state law.
Among the victims of the massacres of 23 November related to the elections to the Governor’s office were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this South African province and his father Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of an influential family of Ampatuans, were arrested.
There are also Muslim separatists on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippines on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech sounds Invictus: Undefeated) will come to the U.S., which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandely.
The role of a world-famous fighter against the apartheid was born by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose for his creation years ago.
The second male role of the legendary South African champion in the rugby of Francoise Pienaara was Matt Damon.
With the input of the films, it is made from advertisements of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlah Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachary Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 with the Nobel Prize for Peace.
He was the President of the Republic of South Africa between 1994 and 1999.
A great expectation, as it comes to the public at a time when in the South African Republic, however, the preparations for the world championship in football, at the same time, the media excite alarming reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination of populations by the Montenegro-governmental majority.
According to the reporting agency AP, announcements for a new film in JAR are still positive, despite numerous reservations against the inclusion of the main roles of "proflecting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I’ve been dreaming of this role for many years and I’ve been preparing for it well.
I have also met Nelson Mandella many times personally in order to - as it is said - beat his energy, in an interview after the film’s celebration premier in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandel's personality and message with the movie.
It’s a story of the South African Republic, but it’s about every person, he added.
The National Rugby Team
A picture based on the booklet of British writer John Carlin with a freely translated title In the role of an enemy: Nelson Mandela and a game that gave the nation a portrait of the South African human rights defender during his first presidential election.
Morgan Freeman tries to strike two races during the film, and after years of mutually limited population groups, as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in the South African national rugby dress at the World Cup at the time, which the JAR won.
For the entrance to the herb in the trees, which is understood in the JAR almost as something sacred, Mandela scattered fourteen years ago large sheep mainly of the white audience and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people in one nation, introduced rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
If the stressed situation in JAR improves, it will only be shown.
However, the White South Africans are skeptical, as an example in a recent interview for the NN was told by the rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
The transformer burns in London for tens of millions of crowns
The fire fired the transformer of Čeps in the division in the Upper Town of Lounska.
According to the spokesperson of the spokespersons of the countryside, Luka Marvan, six units are involved in the fire.
Originally, the hammers wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reviewed the opinion and the fire smells the mixture of water, foams and special hammers.
The reason was the technical failure, the internal breakthrough of the transformer.
No one has been injured, according to Pavly Mandát’s spokesman, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The harm is estimated to be a few dozens of millions of crowns, precisely counting it will succeed until the fire is over.
The devastated transformer must be replaced by a new.
In the course of ten years of the operation of Čeps, nothing similar has happened, the shortcomings of this type are unique, complemented.
The supply of electricity, according to the spokesperson of ČEZ for the North Czech Republic, Soni Holinger, Hendrych, did not have an interruption of the operation of households, offices or company fires.
A.s. Cheps operates in the territory of Czech Republic as an exclusive operator of the transmission system, electrical wires 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 separated transformers with 67 converting electricity transformers from the transmission to the distribution system and a 4339 kilometre-length pipeline.
Jančura is calling for a criminal announcement for three heightmans from the Czech Republic
The Owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura is presenting a criminal announcement for three social-democratic threats.
And that on Michala Haška from the South Morav region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubian region and the heightman of the Olomouc region of Martin Tesaryk.
Janchura introduced it in the 20 minutes of the Radio Journal.
The complaint is related to the company’s efforts to operate regional train transport in some countries.
However, all regions finally signed long-term agreements with the Czech Drahams.
All three heights attack us and talk about choosing ropes, while we have brought the offer only for what they wanted.
They claim we are more expensive than the Czech trails, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech trails that were closed last week.
So we have nothing to do with defending ourselves.
It is for a speech to the Student Agency, Jančura Radiojournalist said.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all countries that they did not take their steps in accordance with European law.
He is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
The hashek of submitting a criminal notification is considered a further continuation of Mr. Jančury’s media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertising by his companies and his own persons.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and for the same challenge as the other Gentiles.
I suppose that even on this occasion it will be clearly shown that Mr Jančura is the one who manipulates the public in the area of regional rail transport and uses false and true arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura has already announced last week that he has invested several million krones in advertising, which will warn about the disadvantage of the countries.
The radio magazine said the campaign would stop after Christmas and want to continue in it after New Year.
He said the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jančura after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Drahams and, on order, about 150 billion krones did not write tender.
According to Janchury, it is similar to illegal acts and is contrary to the view of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur has already been threatened by a Member of the Czech Republic.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we can get a bus license.
He presented himself as a Member of the Czech Republic, I know what the Lord is talking about, I will not say his name, said Jančura Radio Journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus will be free and mandatory
Vaccination against pneumococcus from January brings together harsh habits.
It must be the first to be free for families and at the same time irrefutable.
But the voices are already calling out that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of a free vaccine against pneumococcus tops.
The Institute of Medicine already establishes the maximum prices of vaccines that will be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are already clear in the vaccination process.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August children
Children who were born last August 2 and later can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that there is no one dose of vaccination yet.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier must pay for another vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of age of the child.
Last year, she volunteered to vaccinate her children against pneumococcus.
The parents paid $1,600 for one dose and more.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of younger children.
In total, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand krone per year on vaccine doses.
However, it will save the treatment that children will need without vaccination.
So far, the state for all the flat vaccination of children gave about 500 thousand per year.
The vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
The pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcus infections will die for us in a year according to a study in hospitals of up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children have been vaccinated against pneumococcus in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, there are opinions that this vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
Since January, it has to be secured by insurance companies and uncompliance.
For example, the chief of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsky Civil Association indicated that the vaccination would be better.
Its pneumococcus vaccine association is promoting for a long time.
Experts at the international conference that participated in our association were not fully satisfied with the voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been done.
I think this is the way we have to go, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumococcus.
We don’t think about it at all at this point,” said his spokeswoman Vlastimil Shrine.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
The Chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Children's Doctors, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that he has his voluntary vaccination disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of revaccinations "When this vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was launched as a voluntary," Cabrnoch said.
Experts expect their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcus from more than 80 percent of fresh parents next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is diarrhoea even in the fact that as the first flat vaccination of children it is paid by health insurance companies, not state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving it for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy substances themselves.
However, the concerns of practical pediatricians relating to the purchase of vaccines are related.
According to the original intention, the vaccines should buy insurance companies and doctors should receive them similarly as the state supplies them substances to other vaccines.
However, some Members were afraid that insurance companies could "have money out of health insurance."
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy substances and wait for the insurance company to pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical pediatricians will invest in 40,000 vaccines a month, which is a significant amount.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist stole in the museum
The son of the famous American creator of fantasy Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal images worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was assaulted when loading 90 images into his vehicle and adhesive.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to enter a museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81, celebrated the creation of characters Barbara Conana and Tarzana.
At the time that this happened, the artist was located in Florida, according to the press agency Associated Press.
AP cited the most nominated police officer who said that Mr. Frazetta younger could be motivated by long-term family disputes.
Before the police, Mr. Frazette issued a younger swearing statement, a 52-year-old, as he did according to his father's instructions, "to get to the museum in any way possible and to move pictures into alignment spaces", according to the agency.
Mr. Frazetta senior refused to grant any such permission, according to the agency.
Labourists Prevent Planned Tax Growth
Ministers defended the increase in taxes and infringement of expenditure reported in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory’s “delayed” the possibility to show that he’s seriously thinking of delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until the election.
The Chancellor also fell under the fire because of the disability of workers with low and medium-sized income.
According to his proposal, it is mainly a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Distinction in relation to social insurance
The committees protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance against "problems".
Social insurance is rising - an increase of approximately £3 trillion a year - which has distorted the community of entrepreneurs who have stated that it is an employment tax, while focusing on the economy’s recovery.
This increase, limiting these revenues over £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
PBR KEY BODY
Social insurance will increase by another 0.5% since April 2011
The economic situation is worse than expected by 4.75 percent this year
New Tax 50% of banking bonuses
Increase of 1% corporate taxes for small businesses
Reduction of taxes for electric vehicles and wind power plants
Retirement increases by 2.5 %
According to the State Financial Administration, some revenues will fall by £30000 a year and some revenues will fall by £40000 a year, while some revenues will rise by £10000 a year.
The ministers announced that their goal to reduce the deficit by the end of 2013 is "complete decision-making", but they insisted that 60 percent of special taxes should be 5 percent of the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and expenditure reduction would be a "good in the ocean" compared to what needed to be done.
"These are large numbers. This will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which you eat absolute basic demand for the next four years," the BBC said.
Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should take place over the past year.
But the development of forecasts for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be deprived after the Chancellor has been forced to revise the previous amounts.
In a statement, the decline in the economy was 4.75 per cent this year - much worse than a 3.5 per cent decline predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Lost opportunity"
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning labourists against the "debt crisis", have marked a planned loan of £789 trillion over the next six years as unemployed.
The ministers failed to submit a credible plan for how it could be paid, they added, "cynically" delayed this decision until the time after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything important to what could be done," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so, but they missed it."
"All important notifications will be made after the elections if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Tory's proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a larger extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that money gained by tax increases and expenditure cuts should be used to support spending next year rather than to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "based on sand".
BBC politician Nick Robinson said the timing of the message - for example, the above inflation will rise and the inability to pay taxes in April - that this could lead to the accusation of the Chancellor in the election campaign if money would be difficult to get back a year later.
However, labourists are required to provide special assistance if people are very in need of it and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget
Although the ministers did not disclose the details of the expenditure after 2011, economists stated that it was clear that reduction in public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognized Institute of Budget Studies said Chancellor figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially in the future include transport, higher education and defense.
“It’s really very painful,” said Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come only after the elections if we win them," Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Deloitte's account revision.
"It was a report on the suspicious preliminary budget. Markets implement it."
FBI investigates in U.S. prisons in Pakistan
The FBI investigates five Americans suspected of being connected to extremists in Pakistan.
The men were arrested for an attack on a house in Sargoda in the eastern Pandhab province, according to the BBC’s U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether they were the same men who were declared unknown in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia in the last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are stated that they are originating in Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the other from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very curious about the conditions under which they were arrested and under which circumstances they stayed there," said Ian Kelly, spokesman.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the imprisonment and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their actions here and whether these are actually missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washgington said men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
He stated that the house was always the center of the interest of local police and that there was no charge against the arrested men yet.
Foreign Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, said Reuters, but said the United States "must cooperate much closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the terrorist infrastructure that involves recruitment and training of people."
The disappearance of these five students from a home in northern Virginia was announced to their families at the end of November.
Rejecting amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, according to the Amnesty International Group’s travel report.
The report describes in detail the “motives of torture” in the regime before and after the controversial presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was killed and burned with cigarettes, and another said he threatened rape.
Iran rejected the above-mentioned criticism of the human rights report.
The officials said this criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens of them were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmud Ahmadined, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were linked and the prosecutors condemned the last five persons to the death penalty.
The BBC writer John Leyne, who is now located in London, said earlier in protests, senior leader Ajjatoláh Ali Chomejni declared the inadmissibility of some forms of torture and prohibited their implementation in the repair facility of Karizak.
But since then, almost no criticism of legal power has been tolerated, as our writer said.
Fake Confession"
Amnesty International cited a report by a 26-year-old computer student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protests against election results.
"I was often caught in my face," he said in a statement.
"They smoked me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to kill me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half in consciousness, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Charroubí, was arrested after elections and arrested to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior officials rejected allegations of rape, but admitted torture.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
The amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice had established committees for the investigation of permissible concerns and government responses, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities had been unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees had been published.
The group said at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to avoid further demonstrations.
In the city park, a ski resort was created.
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform the Bristol monument into a seat track for the race.
The riding path for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the seat track in Brandon Hill park, there was a short jumping tower before a 100 meter long seat track.
Student of the fourth year of medicine John Hickman said that it was a wonderful view from the top of the seat track, but that it was really calling.
It was a wonderful view of the bright lights of the city down.
“There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the world – some of them are real talents,” he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or sitting trails.
After the Thursday evening race, the snow was allowed to break.
They're still me
Can it be a French Muslim?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At the time when Swiss voters called after the ban on the construction of minarets and generally spread terrible reports about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American scholar wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate – and whether they could integrate – into one of the most open secular continents.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author's last work, "Why don't French like headshots" (2006), this elegant and discussed study of controversial issues that have been divided and employed in the country for 15 years and whose impacts are still being felt today.
The last book of Mr. Bowena has a broader and more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the base.
He spent months in the churches, schools and institutes that now take care of 5 yung 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, he reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the issues that are most concerned.
Should Muslim join a marriage union in the mosque or in the municipality (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Do Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These are apparently the world’s controversial questions that are discussed and which are part of everyday life rather than the political drama that employs the media.
The author identifies a new generation of mamms, teachers and intellectuals, among others known as the general person, except Tarika Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open discussions about how it can be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are unreliable to the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed call on the assumption that this group is the antipoly of Selafi—the defenders of the Sunni Islam purist, united in Saudi Arabia—but influences European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He asks himself how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite, which thus defenced the Laic public) are actually devoted to the thoughts of pluralism.
It is believed that Muslims have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Instead of developing pragmatism, he found “a shaping of value screws”.
After reading this book, someone may tend to say "Yes, but not now."
The most unpleasant outlook in the world
The Arctic becomes more dramatic than the other environment on the planet.
Limiting ice covers alarming speeds, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be aimed at new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
In the book "On the Fine Ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, resembles the natural history of the icon of the North, a polar bear.
Known well with the complicated history and practices of velvivality, it describes the long tradition of polar researchers who tried to strengthen the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old cowboy, who only fought against the musketi’s bulb, is a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who swim for the bodies of their just killed mothers were caught and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in a circle tent.
Even today, zoo gardens typically have a million times smaller area than the area available for adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
After clicking here, you will find more!
Mr. Ellis pumps from the works of other writers and historians and often comes back to the threat that hunters are threatening the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are hunted on skis and all of them are armed with powerful attacking gloves that push their cruise.
It is ironic that it takes place in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "Po Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of the New Scientist, offers clear and unrejoiled responsibility for science for the Arctic and an exciting flying view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorological nor oceanographics have adequate response to the rate of change.
That's because of the lack of tests.
The research routes of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century indicated for the first time the flow of ice.
The ponorks during the Cold War then maped the flooding overheads when they were submerged.
Satellite surveys and extensive fields of sonde in ice creams are useful, but many are still done thanks to the unthinkable individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely cruel world of the fall system within the Arctic ice, created by stealing salt water, which is frozen when frozen.
But from the height of this bear to microscopic miracles, all of this is condemned to the destruction as soon as the summer ice moves, which sometimes takes place between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, we can be.
6000 seafarers put a cave on the tombs in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson, 19-year-old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple guard on the grave of a soldier who never met the cradle.
For him and other naval pedestrians who traveled from the Johnson Camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the tombs, it was the day that he gave hold to men and women who once weared the same shoes.
Within a few months, we can be ours, Robinson said about the falling soldiers.
If it happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show respect to me as I try to do about it right now.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put the cemetery veterans in several departments at the Arlington Food Act.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington pottery.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen take this journey every year and stops in different cities along the way to worship the monuments of the army and victims of terrorism.
Worcestesters are not looking for profits in this, they are devoted to America, which they think in other states.
This year, more than 16,000 volunteers placed on the Arlington Cemetery, on the territory of Pentagon, on the cemetery of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and on the monumental flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
In the second year, Walmart’s Foundation is spending more than $150,000 on the purchase and transport of shields.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a defeated member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said that it was her way to return what the victim is doing.
This is a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Inherently, volunteers walked through the cemetery through the surrounding herbs and pearls.
Volunteers went to older graves from the First and Second World War and from the Vietnam War, because they were not visited as often as newer tombs.
The mood was positive when the children played and held their hands together, when they transported a young boob to our small stones.
Each circle was dark green with a small red bees upper portion.
In section 60, where most veterans from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained really quiet.
The Association of Service Organizations devoted 1,000 servants to decorating the department, but the dirty mood of wars just filled this area.
Some sincerely wept, others prayed, and family and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read loudly the names, thrown into stones, while others climbed to look at small black and white names, pressed into a wet flower, where the brick stones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who took tears out of the eyes before the tomb of their son.
It was eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the last retreat of Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
“No one should never forget why we are free . . . my son paid for it,” she said.
“Although I’ve been away for a long time, I want to be the one who will remember him.”
US government supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government arrested a U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops to the country, said foreign ministry officials Saturday.
The supplier that has not yet been identified has worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consulate officials, along with the U.S. interest department in Havana, sought access to the arrested on 5 December.
Certain accusations have not been published, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything called "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, are at risk of imprisonment.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speech are considered to be serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and disturbed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to take prices, but the permission was rejected.
The detention of an American supplier can be the result of increasing tension between the Communist Brother Castr, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was observed as a "retention tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report a New York Times jail on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes specific steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more space for opposition, the United States will take mutual steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and searched goods in a country where the average salary of state employees is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used first to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must notify their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of Americans in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind the networks for criminal offences such as drug passing, Gloria Berben, a press office for the U.S. Section for Interests in Havana, said.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
Prison and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's do this free mobile phones - are criminals in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Group's programme, who recently published an unfavourable report on freedoms in Cuba, called the "New Castro" and "The Oldest in Cuba"
Vivanco said the accused were often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all the solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often triggers negative reactions in the United States, just as these two countries are aimed at broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are disclosing conflicts regarding the sending of men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities uncovered on Saturday the alleged leader of a conspiracy on sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. unit nationals there, and said they hoped that this case could help to uncover a wide network of young terrorist verbs and terrorist attacks.
Investigators said they were looking for a grey rebellious personality known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men posted a comment to approve terrorist attacks has a YouTube video site.
Saifilláh took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get into the distant region of Pakistan in the native band of Pakistan, which is the home of al-Qaeda and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistani reporter, who reported the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to certify commanders of al-Qaeda and that men were not part of the CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, a few days later, they were driven into the eastern Sarghody district, far from the terrible mountains in the northwest, which became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a striking unit.
The reason why they were dismissed, said an official who talked about preservation of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not frightened and still attempted to obtain consent for access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the exercise of Pakistani law.
The case of this five-year-old, which remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI, emphasizes the critical role of robbers in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks on 11 September 2001, the U.S. Scientific Service has assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The naboots of the organization act as guards, killing those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the Holy War and those who might be excitement.
American fake recruits were undergoing special investigations at al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at NEFA’s headquarters in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more careful in recent years in allowing them to join them because the U.S. reporting agencies have gained experts on their inventory methods.
If we try to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their inventory model, which has already been followed so much? said Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the website.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters walked through the streets on Saturday and asked for more emphasis on climate action from negotiators at the Bella City Congress Center.
The protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants to the event, but the police suggested that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a bunch of masked activists placed several small seats near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day when a small event of climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried transparency with English inscriptions "This is not a planet B" (i.e., secondary) and one in Spanish, saying "The country says 'satisfied'."
The protest took part in several celebrities including Danish models and photographers Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother’s birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the unwilling state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still happening.
This is partly the reason why we have decided to join this great move -- to go through the world and call on the world's leading personalities to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to do it, it cannot be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching Bell’s center and said she had arrested 19 people, primarily because they were either planted masks or had pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participated spectators who doesn’t want to be identified because it’s involved in climate talks, activists mask as athletes and in black clothes have put a number of seats near Copenhagen’s main channel, which is located near several ministry.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, they started lights, but then followed "a few large explosions."
Within the Congress Center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the flow during the afternoon.
But the protest has probably not entered into the awareness of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I wasn't aware of."
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the story is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed whether the journey was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
It is seen the focus of the broad public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, it can also be said that it is a violation of the acts or freedom of others.
Test data reveals constant racial differences
The Federal Certificate of Knowledge Achieved in Mathematics last week was a welcome element of good news about Columbia County Public Education.
Although the district is far behind high-performance systems of the country, the certificate has been more advanced in the fourth and eighth class students over the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains behind the latest figures of the National Teaching Center for Progress in Teaching are the constant differences in the knowledge achieved between African Americans and white students, both on the local and national side.
The average result of the fourth-class white students in Columbia County has increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but in their African-American layers, there was only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge gained has actually increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress in African Americans in eighth-class remains essentially balanced, with the deviation of statistically meaningless one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white students was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not just encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-class students in 2003, when the first NAEP was performed in the district, was 60 degree points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly closer to 58.
Some of the training defenders in the district said last week that the results celebrated by the mystery of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were more widely stimulated in white students where they had already had high results.
This would indicate that we have increased the amount of support for those at the higher end of the stage, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality of employment in the district.
When he jumps up and down due to the spread of two or three points, a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown committee (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth-class primary school in Eaton.
Frequently criticizing Ms. Rhee's reporting style, Ms. Brown said that the reporting of the test results means high school in the city is desperate and requires attention.
It is obvious that you always want to see the bets and I respect it.
But what is terrifying is that we haven’t devoted almost any time and energy needed to devote to our high school.
Ms. Rhee said that the effort of the district is to continue searching for better ways aimed at the needs of low-performing students.
With this fall, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new undergraduate reading, Wilson's Reading System, focused on students of high school classes and high school students who have failed to manage the basics of reading earlier in their school career significantly stand behind their classmates.
Everyday mathematics and sixth-class mathematics teachings, emphasizing the real-life games and experiences that came into the district behind former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think we should continue working and carry out the best possible interventions in those students who remain below the class level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others stated that the NAEP results explained the question of whether Ms. Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain dilemma of Miss Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California in Berkeley where he studied the results of the tests in urban areas.
The conventional process of correction is to focus on funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia County.
Thus, the focus can bring political sounds that target an important agenda.
However, the exit belongs to other city directors who try to maintain a medium flow between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We have to delay the relatives of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be assured that their children will be given excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the fundamental element of reducing the difference between achieved results is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to achieve the eligibility of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes," said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his Teacher Association last year for the school year in the length of 185 days, which is considered a "price" for the search for greater increases in the next year.
Make higher education part of a better future
The travel bus entered the Gettysburg Railway with a loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, a 12-year-old, came out and for a moment she was sitting on white columns, cigle fasades and smaragd green grasses.
Gracielini's parents were hard to graduate from El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never been on the ground.
Now she and other eighth-class students in the group studied Gettysburg, where schools were $3,8690 a year, their position was rather than scaring visitors of potential students’ enthusiasm.
Yes! That's it! called Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
"Man, really?" she thought when she was disclosed by a low proportion of professors to students.
Pennsylvania Railway was one of the seven who visited on their three-day trip and now were completely surprised by the future news: It’s not the question of whether you enter the Railway.
The question is where it comes from.
However, this is a portable problem regarding the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high schools or who are pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get an ongoing education and thus enter high school.
In fact, a fifth of this "long generation" of Spanish students from college - remarkable results show that many of their immigrant parents, most of the Mexicans and Central Americans, arrived in the United States without completing their high school.
Their success story is important, researchers say, because it emphasizes their path point forward for a generation that played an end role in the labour fields of the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say they have had a natural inclination to school, and a native diligence and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and searched for ways to replace American education’s ignorance.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciel and millions of children who would like to take the train – especially if these efforts continue in time.
If we consider that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and the ability to help them orient themselves into the system, any simple intervention in each individual point will not solve it, says Patricia Gádara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American area.
We need to think about providing these children with a preschool network in all ways to go to college.
The federal program that financed the Graciela train tour is a useful example.
Known as the GEAR UP (approaching), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch rows of training programs that start for students from small-income groups at high school and continue until these students complete high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than % have entered the college, according to data from the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraq's oil ministry reaches agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to force significant oil companies to rebuild its non-profit infrastructure during two auctions held on Saturday.
The Iranian oil industry has concluded ten agreements with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been deployed for decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies have left with a share of capital to two out of 10 outburst fields.
Seven American companies paid for participating in the second auction that started on Friday.
Only one gave a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements on the field that was irritated in June.
The secret participation of U.S. oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, you are on the way to Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online report.
It will be a long time before anything else is available for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, emphasised by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the download of the U.S. army are likely to reflect American societies from much more intensive business in Iraq, which has provenly the third largest raw materials reserves, analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were in disadvantages, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more likely to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to conclude agreements with the Ministry.
The leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left with empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were allocated at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in more contract offers than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become the main economic force as well as the technological force,” said Assam Jihad, spokeswoman of the oil industry.
We are convinced that the Chinese society will be comparable to competition and meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were previously chosen to submit tenders, which were then compared by the ministry by price for bars and the ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level on each field.
Top planner al-Qaeda was probably killed in Pakistan.
U.S. missiles at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan were apparently killed this week, as officials of the U.S. anti-terrorism department reported on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several missiles hit their truck near the city of Miran Śáh in the province of North Vaziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles had been fired from an aircraft without a crew that was operated by the CIA in a band of illegal native tribes.
They were listed on a white car heading to the Afghan border when he was injured, the official, along with the Pakistani Citizen Science Agency, called Miran Shah.
The official stated that local armsmen were approaching the point and quickly pushed away what remained from "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorism department officials cited an unspecified witness that said Somali was the death penalty.
Somalia was described as a highly built planner of al-Qaeda military operations, which led terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in restoration around the world, a senior official who did not want to be appointed to indicate the sensitive nature of American air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he had such a central position, he would have been involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the supreme leader of Al-Qaeda and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia quickly progressed in al-Qaeda's hierarchy and was well linked to other extremist groups in the region.
He had not to be a generally known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to stand before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-built leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban who should be killed since September when, during a similar attack, Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant fraction in the indigenous tribes and three other top-class operational leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using non-pilot planes has decreased from the year from an average of six operations per month to two, according to records of Long War, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have reason for improved terrorist groups’ tactics that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also unpleasantly killing people who were suspected of being informators.
The United Nations High Delegate resigned in Kabul.
The United Nations High Delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would want to resign from his office in March and end such a stormful period of office that was accused of widespread corruption in the election of the United Nations.
Eide’s departure occurs because Obama’s administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation said it supported growth, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for the reduction of the state, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The acceptable commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The rise on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not give up, but simply fulfilled the promise he promised his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a refund.
As I said, it’s time to look at the follower, said Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started searching for refunds.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian, and formerly led by the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhen, a French, who had previously led by the UN peace operation.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamidem Karzaim, who won in the country’s presidential elections for masking the presence of massive elections.
Eide rejected this claim, but said Galgraitha's allegations -- which were released -- "are certainly damaged to the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism in terms of international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of citizens in order to coordinate the relief of efforts to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leader to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to borrow them for the Afghan mission, so he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being spent properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the limitation of its efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the severe United Nations lease regulation undermines its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "a further significant sanctions" on Iran due to a lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week’s journey to areas where wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, has bathelised the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the soldiers’ question of likely development.
One thing that depends on me is whether I have learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [this is] an unpredictable unpredictable in the war.
Obama’s administration decides on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said "a package of encouragement and prohibition" would require "to force the Iranian government to really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their inhabitants will suffer extraordinarily" sanctions.
According to a Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leader in warning that Iran will have serious consequences unless it brings its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists on developing its expertise only for peace purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he pointed out that he wanted to return to talks about limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of his stocks of enriched uranium in exchange for the urgently necessary fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administrative set up such an agreement as a way to strengthen confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it appears that Iran is deviating from temporary agreements - partially for that, a expert says, because the Iranian leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage in the United States.
Honestly, when it comes to Iran’s harshness to the international community in some proposals with which it really agreed at the beginning of October, I think that it has led to the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, along the way, which does not mean the terminology of additional sanctions to Gates.
President Obama laid a deadline for Iran on December 31 to respond to proposals before returning to other elections, including monitoring, which Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "neo-essential and unfunded charges" before some members of the Security Committee on Iran’s nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue in talks with the United States and the next five-four world-wide solutions.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before traveling to the Kurdistan area, rich in oil to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and the Kurdish leaders in Irbil.
It continues a high tension between Kurdish and Iraqi Arab majority, particularly because of borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent US plans from limiting the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by late August.
Gates also tried to highlight Kurdish concerns about persistent depression. U.S. officials cited Gatese when he told the President of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the United Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In the ageing China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propagandistic posts, in which they read that "Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to enjoy more children" and "One child additionally means one tomb."
Then they learned that when official government places in Shanghai were alarmed by low birth and aging population in their city, they suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always spent all our time and energy just one child.
We haven't left anything for the second, says Wang, 31, a human resource manager who has an eight-month son.
More than 30 years ago, China’s policy of having only one child was introduced and thus created two generations of only notoriously boring and depleted children, affected by the over-named “small emperors,” the country threatens the population crisis.
The average childbirth decreased to 1.8 children to a couple compared to six before the policy entered into force, according to the UN data.
The population division, where the population aged 60 and older is expected to grow from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the total average about 20 per cent.
The unbalance is larger in wealthy coastal cities with populations of higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for nearly 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples must have children to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the number of labour forces in the future.
He says it is "being old does not mean being rich -- like in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden."
Step-by-step calming
As introduced into the Constitution in 1978, China’s policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate to date introduced by the government of the Communist Party.
The two who violated politics faced enormous penalties -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s officials have promoted a policy that helped the country prevent critical resource pumping, while human rights defenders were condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion during the second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selection abortion, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men to women.
In recent years, the population officials were gradually more mild in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including cities, national minorities and cases where men and women were single - and in 2007 they relieved the dictions of their passwords promoting the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Peking University’s Institute of Population Research, said that central government officials had previously discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was a single.
In June, Shanghai became the first city in China to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, there were posters, urging parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, to describe in detail how it would be entitled to have another child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and pick up the shelves under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials reported.
Refusing Response
Although officials in one rural city in the vicinity of Shanghai noticed an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign, most urban districts did not report any changes.
The city district of Huinan with a population of 115000, for example, still recorded four to five cases per month.
Shanghai’s disappointed officials said that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the Caolu district of Shanghai, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and it was legally permitted for them.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a docational catching network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West consider one child’s policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose woman is pregnant in the seventh month in connection with the first child.
Yes, we were delighted to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other pairs indicate psychological reasons for defeat.
Wang, the human resource manager, says that they only take one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of the attention of our families and all of us took care of us.
We were not used to provide care and in fact we didn’t want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old translator company, expressed this much more unprecedentedly.
For two-carrier parents from the middle class who reduced birth, he said to be successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20 and 30-year-olds look at parents as the first days of a Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of life for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts huge demands for parents’ time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions about space -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and strategies -- "You have to have a summary prepared at a time when a child is nine months for good pre-school education.
Most of his friends want to satisfy one child, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group has set up a plan for reducing emissions.
The UN-sponsored Climate Conference -- characterized by far-reached attitudes and mutual oppression -- refocused on Friday on the release of a document proposing an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas volumes over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the nearest period.
The text that can provide an outlet for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation emphasizes the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the road forward.
But there was significant progress in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc Working Group, this text clearly indicates how much money rich countries should provide for the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
It provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to limit their carbon emissions and what should be the top limit for global temperature rising, which politicians will still be able to tolerate.
This delivers a high dose of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, top representative of the washington club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, will set out 180 pages of the text from the negotiations to focus on what the top climate official at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It sets out currencies for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 per cent for a year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union has negotiated rapidly on Friday that it will provide $3.6 billion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change — from flood management and dryness to decommissioning.
But on Friday, he still mentioned the same type of verbal fires that were overwhelmed in conversations last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Climate Representative, rejected a speech demanding binding greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries in comparison to voluntary major developing economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
Posun signaled that Obama’s administration had set a harder line against China, beige officials of Bush’s administration just two years ago.
The United States will not join the treaty without transferring major developing countries and carrying out actions, Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told U.S. climate dealer that either the lack of "select sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" led earlier in the week to a message that the United States could not help the world financially.
With the future of the economic paths of the world’s main powers, tanks have sprouted within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preservation of individual economies, rather than preservation of the planet, between China and the United States, with respect to the fulfillment of their relevant commitments, while the poorer nations point out that two dozens of the most influential countries in the world ignore the scientific imperative for the implementation of more emphasizing actions.
Ricardo Ulate, delegate of Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in search of a way to prevent large emitters responsible in their actions.
It is clear that the new economic hegemonia is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional advisor in the area of climate change in Mexico and Central America for the international protection of nature.
Some of the countries that have indicated the most vulnerable effects of climate change that they would like to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, made a 24-page proposal for the deal last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who conducted international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that promoting small island nations "has developed a political pressure on the entire polyrtic process" partly because they are now united and demanding actions from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations led to a new urgency when the delegations focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of government have defeated the agreement.
High positions of officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Rameš and Chinese Deputy Minister, have gone out of the planes and have held Bella center halls to closed doors of meetings and new conferences so that they can overturn claims to be assessed next week.
The total scale of the meeting - when 13,000 people were moved from and to the Congress Center every day, activists playing guitars inscended at night ironising looking at the countries they thought they were sending, and they came to pass proposals from hand to hand -- by hand to hand, by electronics, by paper, than by paper.
Intensity is only a building: nearly all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We have reached high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
There are heavy weights.
The first British train at a speed of 140 miles per hour pre-defined this Monday feelings
At 5:13 on Monday morning, the stars cut the dark on the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in the UK.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and a flight from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras and exceeds 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed passenger circuit outside London.
Hopefully, the new service will connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large Midland, North and Scotland aglomerations with London.
Forced standing water should be shortened in passenger transport and on commercial roads, and the transition from aircraft and cars to the rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road crashes.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were allowed to gain this vision.
But dozens of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, an inevitable fight for projects and environmental concerns have now accelerated the construction of British high-speed routes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a realizable study, transmitted its message to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to Times.
It gave him a detailed route map of another planned high-speed network stage.
The new connection between London and West Midland was designed within five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
In the open landscape, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also plans to set three choices for a large high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond to the spring.
The preferred choice is the configuration of the form of the letter Y, when one high-speed line should lead to western Midland.
The route should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle nad Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems to have been the most successful election," a railroad expert said.
Once it is finished, the time between London and Edinburgh will be shortened to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage that will not be opened before 2025 could allow a passenger to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than an hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to ride at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already proposed to take 400 m long trains, which would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 routes could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
Given capital limitations, the existing stations are expected to expand to understand the high-speed network.
Railroad experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not they want to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be made before the general elections.
Even if the wheels are put into movement, the network should be built on parts.
Trains should first be put into operation not on high-speed routes, but on existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain the time between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a crucial contact point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a guide point for the revolution on the rail.
Taxpayers pay a £75,000 mortgage to the Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, holder of the head seat labyrinth of Tory in the House of Parliament, paid taxpayers for thousands of pounds of expenses last year for the orange that he built in his home in the electoral district.
David Cameron was degraded by a prison spokesman for complaining that deputy members were living "from the seats" and raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build a dub-covered expansion in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for a special interest, a total of 100 pounds per month to taxpayers.
The general authorities approved the claims in time and was thus not interrogated by Sir Thomasen Leggem, who conducted the Member State expenditure checks. Last night Mr Duncan expressed his claims "it should have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-story houses in all of its electoral districts in Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Financial Office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is labeled in plans as "orangeries".
Neighbors describe it as a "glass for fun and relaxation".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide some explanations for the increased loan during the last check by the General Standards and Privileges Committee in the last adjustment of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupilary assurance of the hypothesis of £271406 from his asset in London to the house in his electoral district, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Parliament.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan had charged about 1400 pounds a month in the interests of the mortgage until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds per month.
The interest of the RBS mortgage of Mr. Duncana's mortgage could not change at this time, indicating that all of this was intended for the financing of a £75,000 loan.
The standard variable RBS mortgage income decreased in December 2007 from 7.94 per cent to 4 per cent in March this year, with remaining remaining.
The last document of the general authorities indicates that Mr Duncan continued to claim 1250 pounds per month this year in May.
Mr. Duncan left his work as a Shadow Head of the House in September after a secret recorder filmed him and said the MPs must survive "on the ground" after the expense scandal.
"In principle, it is nationalized, you have to live for an assignment and treat you as with s**t."
He said, "I wasted money on my garden and a right and a small break on what was needed.
And I could claim all that damned share, but I won't do it."
A MEP, a millionaire from his former career as a oil merchant, was first asked to explain his edition in May when it turned out to have charged thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the financial office approved that it "can be considered excessive."
One of the activists dropped the bulb in the form of a library in the herb of Mr. Duncana for a protest after it was revealed that he had smuggled 4,000 pounds for three years.
When last night he was questioned about the increase of the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was due to the increase of capital, which was approved by both the financial authority and then Leggem."
He added: "This is not a controversial issue of hiding and calling or violating the rules or something else.
It's absolutely straight line down, according to rules, legitimate and that's all.
It wouldn’t be clearer or simpler in many other ways.”
Come all to see the chat on the brighton coast with an advent calendar.
The Brighton coastal houses have found a new sense of life in autumn months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group, which encourages the duchess’ creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their chats for every day in December, and to use Christmas wheels as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when it allowed visitors to view the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and bishop’s bread and welded wine provided for free.
The selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, and The First Noël, where the chatting was represented by Janetty Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old assistant in television marketing from Hove, is a non-sponsored priest in Chichester diecezia and leader of Beyondu.
He said, “We want to make religion much more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to strangers old buildings? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a shameful way.
“The idea of an advent calendar in chats was just like a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsing place, and we have tried to try and present it on a spiritual path.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went into the streets on Saturday, demanding a stringent and binding deal against global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people at the same time.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources, and hundred thousand organizers, according to organizers, manifested themselves in cold weather in Denmark at the occasion of the UN Climate Conference, aimed at adopting an agreement that could enter into force on Friday, January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, said the growing global mobilization, a clear proof of the current demonstrations, contributed to the "political tax" of possible failure in Copenhagen.
According to AFP, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the launch of the protest, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break down the exclusions of plaque coats and clashes.
The police immediately attacked severely.
A total of 600 to 700 people were arrested by the police and said it was particularly the Black Blocks members, ultra-radical separate groups that had already occurred in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Coalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the event’s organizers, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested “without difference” and stressed that approximately a hundred of them were “holded in the streets on Saturday night” despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the guide was sent to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
For speakers, a podium was built before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candlesticks with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most Protestants arrived by bus and train from large European cities and there was also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue shirts, created the first meeting in the mornings in Copenhagen on the challenge of the Friends of the Earth group who wanted to create "blue waves" for "equitable climate".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand environmental debt compensation in the interests of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say it's time for you, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water flows dry, we can walk in them today, and it was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of fighting for another world approached ecological organizations.
French European MP José Bové, one of the characters of the fight for the other world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "projecting climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for the other world."
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
About 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
There were hundreds of people in Manila, mostly students, in red clothing and with evocating chips of the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators have gone out to the streets, demanding a strong action against climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement took part in hundreds of people, particularly in Paris, Marseille (jih), Lille (northern), Bordeaux (western) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatistic Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "frash"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declared this step as a "frash".
Approximately 13,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Gruisen war in August 2008 on the control of South Ossetia, which is another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Elections were closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to Abkhaz electoral committee officials, 58% of the elections were attended a few hours before the elections were closed.
The first preliminary results should be published in the evening from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Chief Sergey Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merger with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are fractional.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakashvili "is sorry that Abkhazia has completely fallen into the Russian rule," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory with only 216,000 inhabitants of Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian army.
After the separation from Georgia, after the conflict between 1992 and 1993, in which several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said 54-year-old historian Kvarčiya Světlan, AFP, who also admitted that he voted for President Bagapche.
It was one of those who came to vote in a school election room in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palms at the entrance.
The issue of the Russian rule is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the coast of the Black Sea, which can be proud of the wonderful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Baghdad are located next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to watch the apparent course of elections waited for a warm welcome by the district mayor of Beslan Arshby.
"We, the Abchazians, are grateful," he said in a small order, having in mind the support of Moscow and in particular its decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexey Ostrovskij, a member of the Russian parliament and added a glass vodka to it.
The opposition, represented in elections by former Vice-President Raulem Khadzhimb and two traders Zaus Ardzinb and Beslan Boutbo, criticized the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
To win in the elections, a over-half majority is required 50% plus one vote.
If none of the candidates fail to achieve this result, the decisive battle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went into the streets on Saturday, demanding a stringent and binding deal against global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people at the same time.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources and hundred thousand organizers, manifested in the afternoon in the cold weather in the capital of Denmark, hosting by December 18, 193 delegations from countries, a deal that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the guide was sent to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
For speakers, a podium was built before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candlesticks with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, the incidents occurred shortly after the exit, when a group of hundreds of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed cells and clashes, began to break down the exclusions.
The police immediately surrendered and attacked without waiting, while several protesters hit the country.
A total of 600 to 700 people were arrested by the police and said it was particularly the Black Blocks members, ultra-radical separate groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Later in the afternoon, one police officer was injured with a sheet coat, and four cars were burned near the squad near the incidents, according to police sources, about 20 people were arrested.
We focus on extremist groups, police spokeswoman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters were again flying into the air.
Most Protestants who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue shirts, in the mornings in Copenhagen created the first meeting on the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "equitable climate".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand environmental debt compensation in the interests of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French European MP José Bové, one of the characters of the fight for the other world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "projecting climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for the other world."
Oxfam authorized several well-known characters, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to talk to a date.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
About 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people were manifested in front of the capital city of the Philippines, mainly students in red clothing and with evocating scratches of the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators have also met with a demand for a thorough action against climate change.

The subjects of geography and history will be reinforced as part of the reform of the general gym, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel said on Sunday during the interview for JDD magazine that the topics of history and geography will be "developed" within the framework of the reform of the general gym, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the gym, focusing on precise sciences.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all will be the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, “they have to end with coverage,” because S specialization is no longer focused on precise sciences, but “they are in essence the best students.”
The ES and L specialization can’t be for some of the sub-specializations, continues and emphasizes: “I haven’t heard many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year of professional gyms, geography and history are not taught.”
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by Humanity, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagree with the government's project to cancel the mandatory teaching of history and geography in the master's year with specialization in S, including many intellectual members and teachers, just as they criticized this.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "it is not considered" to cancel philosophy in the S specialization program of the graduate year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) invited to participate in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they believe is a victim of pedagogical education of future school teachers.
In the course of a Master's 2 (M2) study, the Minister explained that he will undertake an annual reception exam focused on their scope and at the end of the year a further exam verifying their ability to teach.
Participants of professional stakeholders during the second year of the Master's degree and the first year before the students will perform as a professor-stakeholder.
If you count all the stakeholders that will be offered to you before the receiving management, you will gain more experience with students, nearly 300 hours, continued.
The minister also said he would propose a "personal right to education", which has not yet existed in national education.
He reaffirmed the project for the cancellation of the school map by 2012.
At École normale superiore’s elite university, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, the Multi-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) to encourage the University of Ecole normal superiore on Ulm Street.
As one journalist of the AFP reported, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conference, a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions of experts who will be recorded and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and why they would like to learn something more, explained at the 22-year-old conference Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who received the name of the fish from the local lake, called by students.
Around twenty contributing experts are chosen from individual scientific disciplines and explained that the choice is based on their charisma.
“We can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Videos recorded on these lectures will be placed on the school website since December 15.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and the next will follow regularly every two months.
Delays in payments: deceased prison supervisors, planned measures
The prison supervisory committees announced on Friday "total mobilization" as they demand that they be paid premiums and overtimes for Christmas holidays, whose repayment was delayed for January for financial reasons.
The FO (2nd prison supervisors) asked employees who would not have a service to participate in demonstrations held Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities, "blocking them" and thus warning "theft of their wages".
CGT for prison supervisors (the 3rd committees of this sector) has called for "to call meetings in individual prisoners and start a fundamental mobilization" by being "successful and unacceptable" so that "times and fees for work in the night, Sundays and holidays in December"
The first committee of supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "assume to total mobilization (...) in order to express dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and not all included in the financial budget, but ensure that the debt amounts will be incurred in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellor said that Michèle Alliot-Mariova sent a message to prison supervisory committees ensuring that the payment will be made next month.
I know the efforts of prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister wrote in his communication.
I ordered the Administrative Directorate of Prisoners to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation that emerged by the misalignment of overtimes would never repeat in the future, said Alliot-Marie.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous premiums for performing the functions and fulfilling the goals, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those who are "always in the budget."
It is just a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille has spread and announced its decision to boycott to appeal "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not go to work on Sunday or on holidays unless their fees for these days of October will not be paid in December, as well as overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also threatened.
At the time when we are given more work and more tasks without giving us additional staff, it is sad to allow them to pay for these lowest staff positions, the CGT prison supervisors in Bordeaux state.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better on it than others.
However, in any case, the funds are few, the Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" for Christmas than they receive
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, trusts the "goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I receive."
President Michelle and his wife spoke in a special edition of a series that will be broadcast on Sunday evening at ABC about how they are going to spend Christmas and the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, a small four-year-old family partner, gets his share.
Jesus likes Boe, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog will also receive a gift "often" as it comes from the streams of the pre-sending series.
And Michelle Obama also complained against her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts that she receives: "Yes, surely not, I gave you the premium of the gifts last year."
Well, of course, that's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after humor he showed his finger on the first lady's pearl necklace, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hourly-released series with a famous moderator, who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, his husbands also spoke of their most popular gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-degree bike, but also a basketball ball that he devoted to his Kenya father’s Christmas, which he rarely met.
I remember how I saw my father who came to look at us at Christmas and gave me the basketball ball, he told the president.
A long time later, I realized that the ball actually gave me it.
The first lady recalled her home for bridesmaids.
I didn’t even know how to organize it all in my house, and so I arranged all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around my neck, but the little house for bridesmaids I loved, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he is in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to a "injury" occurring after a larger operation in France, but according to his closest "under control" situation, while the RTL station stated that the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors detected "injury resulting from the operation" of a sharp plot that he had carried out in Paris on November 26, he said his press department in Paris was "read by the opera"
However, the singer’s press department has tried to calm the public and said the situation is “under control” and at the same time announced that new medical communications will be issued within 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was introduced into artificial sleep to prevent " diseases and complications".
Within 48 hours, when the patient opens the eyes, we will have a little greater certainty, adds RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on this information on the questionnaire of AFP.
The RTL also stated that, according to "some sources", there was no drainage in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a heated plot.
The surgery, which was planned a few days ago, was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a well-known physician in the art circles.
However, the doctor was not available for RTL information on Thursday.
After the surgery, Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that took place after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday at RTL that his friend was just going through a "bad period" but added that he's "not worried about the rocker" because it's a big "warrior".
He called me just before he went to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing a fool because spending 12 hours on a plane after such surgery isn't funny, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, singer producer Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics" and that the infection was "stoped".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not notice any special concerns.
The singer’s health problems are only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after the fall of his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumour of the thin intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his divorcer.
But since then, every health problem has been very monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on the fence.
In mid-November, his team had to again dementiate the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Small Pool: Prime Minister Bousqueta in his favourite discipline
Francesco Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the World Championships in 2009, won the title of the 2009 European Championship on Thursday in a small swimming pool in Istanbul in a discipline that he particularly likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, the last time the combinations were allowed, only three world records fell, although they were expected to be much more.
One of them overcame the Hungarian race Evelyn Verrasztova for 200 m positioning race and two remaining Russian male staffs for 4x50 m positioning race.
A great embarrassment for Bousqueta, who made a 50-m-free world record, which is already the holder of the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, 50m free way, he won 28-year-old French with the final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which the prime minister started ten swimmen instead of the ordinary eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to overcome the world record (20.30) as he expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there is a world record in my achievement, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers had combinations made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The combinations have helped 238 world records from February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first host to the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination this time did not even help the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in a large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimman failed to overcome a record that holds 400 meters free (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikitou Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew that this time I didn’t overcome the world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my duty.
Lobintsev will be a serious competitor in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: The Roman sarcophagus board belonging to Zolova was excited for $1.5 million
The board of a Roman sarcophagus, which belonged to no one except French writer Emil Zolova, was raised for 1.5 million U.S. dollars on Thursday, which is much more than estimated, said Sotheby’s Art Trader.
The price of this two meters long and 63 cm high front plates, originating from the third century of BC, was estimated to be $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionyst scenes in a processed architectural decoration, surrounded by saturns and bakchanty is a rare piece of similar pieces in the world, maybe four or five," said the AFP, a Vice-President of an ancient and ancient Roman auction, Florent Heintz, on Tuesday.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still going on, but this is the subject that is most likely attracted to, told AFP spokesman Sotheby ́s, Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emile Zola had this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated with her bath at her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the third republic minister in France, and shortly before the Council's president to arrive at the power of marshalla Petaina.
There was a shadow for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found that this record was part of the "remains of Emil Zoly" opened since 1903, the year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Interrupted attempt to leave President Zelayi from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico said on Thursday that the conditions for transportation of Honduras, Manuela Zelayi, whose rebels refused to provide a safe departure warranty, were not met.
After a telephone interview I had with President Zelayo at night, everything is evidence that there is no possibility of realizing this transport, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos said.
The Mexican government aircraft that flew to Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelayu flew back, a source of the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The shooting government wanted to force President Zelayu to "demission" and ask for political asylum abroad, only to give him the chance to leave safely.
But the devoted president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of state.
The firefighter government "has experienced another failure when she wanted me to give up my functions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added a defeated president, hidden at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few concerts.
The Embassy of Mexico asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we can’t accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said the Minister of Interior, Oscar Raul Matute, on Wednesday, to the Honduras Radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur station, headquartered in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduras people, he stressed.
Zelay’s departure messages were mobilized on Wednesday by the defeated president who came to gather around the Brazilian Embassy, where the army strengthened the protection.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the posture of the government.
They show their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, was celebrated on June 28, on the day he organized his preparation for his re-election of public consultations against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He returned from the exile in Costa Rica unexpectedly on September 21 and found an asylum in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he gets out of there, he will be arrested and responsible for the crime of the "veleztrade" for which he is accused, the police said.
President Roberto Michelettim succeeded in organizing presidential elections on November 29 to replace President Zelay.
In controversial elections, recognized by the United States, but convicted by the countries of Latin America such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against the return of President Zelay to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street Renounced, U.S. Trade Balance Calls Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, and the results of the U.S. trade balance indicated an increase both in the United States and in its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq won 0.33%.
According to the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial commented.
But we can’t take it too seriously because the market focuses on “half full glass”.
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on the numbers of the U.S. trade balance, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade balance deficit fell by 7.6% in October, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts are expected to increase the deficit.
Imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the U.S. main business partners, Christopher Cornell, a researcher from Economy.com, said.
However, last week in the United States, unemployment has increased against all expectations, and the number of job applicants has reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new employment candidates has declined “to the lowest this year,” Scott Marcouiller from Wells Fargo Advisors said.
The securities market has also declined.
State treasures gained a 10-year view of 3,482% compared to 3,423% on Tuesday evening and 30-year gained 4,492% compared to 4,408% a day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters screwed "Dates in White"
Several hundreds of supporters of the Cuban regime dismissed on Thursday the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana at the occasion of the World Human Rights Day and prevented further demonstrations on which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
Around forty "Lady in White", a husband or close political prisoners, were recorded directly on the street of the supporters of the Raul Castra regime when they walked towards the center of the capital with a request for the release of political prisoners, the journalist said.
The Yankees!, "Zolds!", "The street belongs to revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were scanned with the high-speed opponents of the regime to dissidents.
The disidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to "security".
A day before, there was a similar protest against "Ladies in White" in Havana, but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about ten civilian police officers were arrested, which also attempted to manifest themselves on Thursday at the occasion of World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this reporter, the police charged dissidents who were detained by the government's defenders in civil vehicles using force.
Detention of disidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The holders of the European Parliament's Sachary Prize for 2005, "Dames in White" organized an unauthorized move for "the release of all, according to the design, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is punished for 20 years of prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of which remain behind the nets.
Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "violent" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government regime supporters against "the opponents of the revolution".
Cuba with the Communist Party in the head and policy of the government of one party is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of non-respect of human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
The knife killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
Shilenec, armed with two knives, killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five more people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during a top Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary findings of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an eighty-year-old man in the pharmacy or before it, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such a version of the police and witnesses.
Heavily injured old man, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance's police union in the hospital due to injuries.
In this pharmacy or before her, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
He began to defend himself at the age of about thirty and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were taken to the same hospital where a 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured is in danger, according to police sources, vital bodies were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then broke and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," the police source said.
The armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He was injured by two others, apparently by accident: the thirty-year-old and the forty-year-old, the other seriously.
It is not clear that all of this happened, because it was about nine o’clock in the evening.
He was armed with two cutting knives carrying the cross behind the back, Arnaud Presse, head of the Alliance in Hauts-de-Seine, said.
Several people around, including young people, were trying to stop and unarmed, according to the AFP’s witnesses.
I saw a thirty-year-old man in a green bundle.
Three young people tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation of Alberto, a cleaner from a distant bar.
He took a hand, including one of the city police officers who broke his belt at the time, and added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commanders, tried to arrest an armed man while injured by the farms, the police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The kidnappers came to tell me there was a injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a large wound to the stomach, told AFP Frederic Allione, a thirty-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, the second 30-year-old who had a knife was also injured.
A man who had no identity documents arrested after the police.
The State Attorney in Nanterre sent the case to the area police department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in jail and waits for hearing.
The police source did not exclude his position in a psychiatric treatment.
Another police source said six police officers were required to manage him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "except outside of himself" as "all the madness of this kind, whose power increases in action by ten times."
U.S.: Polish lawyer again calls for the end of criminal proceedings
The lawyer of Polish-French director Roman Polanski once again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) to stop a criminal trial against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to the moral affair that took place thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the film "Pianista" criticized three judges of the appellant court of the second district in California for a serious mistake in the time of a court transfer in 1977.
I want to stop the trial right now and right now, Hummel said, and added that from the behaviour of the judge who then decided in the case, Laurence Rittenband "had frozen in the back."
According to him, the judge (who has already died) had to act with the State Prosecutor, who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserves to go to jail – which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
The information on this interview was published in the document "Roman Polanski: desired and desired" (Roman Polanski, requested and requested), from the mouth of State Prosecutor himself, David Wellse.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he "have" the author of the document.
If the court refuses to cease the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will request the proceedings in which he will be able to submit evidence of his claim.
The applicant repeated what had been said in the first state, i.e. that there would be no serious investigation of the application for the suspension of the criminal proceedings until Roman Polanski is brought before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled from the United States in 1978, before the court issued a judgment in the case of "unlawful sexual contact" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never entered the U.S. territory again.
Phyllis Asayamo, a prosecutor in Los Angeles, said that Roman Polanski "was supposed to be there to participate in the trial trial."
We want to say not only to Roman Polaski in this case, but also to another accused that it is possible to escape? asks Ms. Asayim.
It is the opinion that the director "is asking for a court of favor and, at the same time, punishes his authority."
One of three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that “there are other alternatives to escape.”
The lawyer Hummel was not the only one who requested the arrest of Roman Polanski's criminal proceedings.
The victim's legal representative, Samanthy Geimer, also re-assured the ending of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client will continue to endure eternal disturbance every time the Polanski case comes out and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair."
“Twenty-two years, it’s enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland for order of the United States
After more than two months behind the grid, he was released into his home jail in his hall in Gstaad, where he waits for possible exile.
Wall Street Ends Without Direction, It Breaks Rising Dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended Friday without the direction, the market rejects between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended to 2.190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blicksilver said from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow margin, the volume of trade has declined significantly, and I think it will remain until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "aid to improve market mood in terms of economic recovery stability," said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail markets grew by 1.3% in November already a second month after each other and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned and increased significantly in December to 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the index has been seen as a new rise in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, “which pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technical actions lose soil under the feet.
The securities market has declined.
The revenue of state treasures with a 10-year view increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a 30-year view increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% a day earlier.
The Miss World election again in South Africa.
After a monthly trip across the South African Republic, 112 candidates to Miss World on Saturday will go beyond their goal to achieve their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion television spectators.
This great celebration of beauty was held in the second year near Johannesburg, and five candidates are currently receiving a semi-final procedure.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargboa from Sierry Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Mao from Canada were elected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was the true faith of an event.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I have seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!, trusted Miss Sierry Leone.
The competition, which takes place in the South African Republic after nine months, will be broadcast in direct transmission from Midrand, northern Johannesburg, from 17:00 a.m. (15 hours of the world time).
I couldn't see a beautiful land in which I planted a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could have experienced it twice, trusted Miss Ksenia Sukhin's world in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "land that breathes".
After months of exhibitions, exams, press meetings and safaris, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to go to the Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, which will also participate in the Aishwarye Rai's elections, winners of 1994, which both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it’s not just a look.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th anniversary will be in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The presentation will be presented by Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of South African Beauty Michelle McLean, and chairman of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is able to welcome the world with the heat that is difficult to deal with, said Julia Morley, President of the Miss World Competition.
As last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on bike, and tasted local cuisine.
The extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who struck their hands.
Unusual for President, Mrs. Sierry Leone.
Without a doubt, the most beautiful memory will remain the loss in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, which will help the country promote the event a little more.
I could have met people I didn’t even dream of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to David's son, reports on the state of Hallydaye are "very positive".
Johnny Hallydaye’s state reports are “very positive,” as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for a few days.
The messages are very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday when he departs from the plane to which he flew from Paris just after 13:00 local time (21:00 a.m.)
The singer's son, who acted quietly, stated that he would be "as soon as possible" to the Los Angeles Cedars-Sinai hospital, to which Johny Hallyday was accepted on Monday due to the post-operative infection caused after the operation of a sharp inter-fractional plot undergoing on 26 November in Paris.
According to a press release, the night was sung in Los Angeles due to the convenience of "allowed into artificial sleep", which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was the doctor of the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles already introduced to artificial sleep. The hospitalization occurred due to the infection after the surgery of a severe interoperable plot held on November 26 in Paris.
Due to serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be reoperated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a school show at a French lycée in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade on Friday morning.
The priority of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the La Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he was departing to the singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
Producent accused Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon who operated at Clinique International du Monceau Park in Paris on November 26th.
They told us that it was a massacre.
Surgeons from Los Angeles said they were rebelled, Camus said.
I have heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday “departed too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon.”
I personally spoke to the physician by phone and he assured me that this journey is no problem, which was much surprised me, since I had suffered twice by the triumph of the interoperable plot, he added.
A short time ago, at RTL radio station, he said that the singer was apparently flying through the Paris operation without a drain, without anything.”
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in artistic circles.
He operated actress Marii Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic on which she worked at the time.
In 2007, she also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove the hematome, a result of bleeding in the brain.
He is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times condemned in cases of denial of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Medical Chamber attorney Olivier Metzner named him a "man without anxiety", which is "regularly" called before the medical Chamber, and which cannot be "recommended far away".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had a "completely good course" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, so the introduction of the drain was not necessary,” he added.
The health problems of the singer are growing since this summer and, in any case, his next tour seems to remain with the questionnaire.
It is obvious that the term for the renewal of the scheduled tour on January 8 (In Amiens, known as red.) appears too close, Camus said.
The UDF increases its tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre not to continue to use their shortages.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to award a brief authorisation of the former Giscard party, with the fact that he should not be used briefly in any media under a threat of criminal trial.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to award the UDF shortage with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear her heritage after giving the left hand.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Centre Movement Council (NC).
This step was supported by the Member of Hervé de Charetta (formerly UMP now NC), who is assigned to own the UDF brand, since it was the first to register it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle).
But on Friday evening, the committee of the UDF’s UDF-led friend François Bayrou, who did not intend to exit, resigned from his silence and filed a formal request to the Minister and Members to stop using the shortage and return the ownership of the mark, under the threat of a criminal trial.
In recent days, you have raised an alarming statement that you are proposing your political movement to resume the UDF+ shortage, writes the Association in its letter signed to 19 of the 24 members of the committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Jean Arthuis from Alliance Centre.
At the same time, you have considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement title+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, the letter signatories also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC Movement to remove all names of UDF from all promotional materials including (free) websites.
At the same time, Hervé de Charette's request is "to transfer the trademark to legitimate owners."
If you do not, we will contact courts in order to respect the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, signatories warn.
In his letter, he stated that UDF "is a full political movement of 1978 "and reminds that Mr. Morin and his friends "opted" to leave in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002 to establish UMP.
Therefore, the Nouveau Centre movement does not have the right to use the UDF (Union pour la democratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for three years to join MoDem and to establish a committee entrusted to protect the moral and material interests of the Valéry Giscard d'Estaing association.
With regard to Hervé de Charettea, the committee continues, "when he registered a trademark", "it has not been a member of UDF for three years," but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used non-existent acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This intactness begins to turn into a criminal offence, declaring, and then expressed with irony to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity from a fraudulent acceptance of names to which we do not have the right to."
Liliane Bettencourt’s case: François-Marie Banier will be sentenced to abuse of weakness.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to make a decision whether he used the state of the eighty-year-old billionaire to prepare her for a part of her wealth, of which her daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, blamed her.
Photographer (62 years), known for his famous photographs, will be sentenced to 15 and 16 April 2010 for misuse of the state of weakness, which is a crime for which a maximum 3 years punishment and a fine of EUR 375 000 is stored.
This decision confirms that a process will actually take place in a case that can be labeled as a family band of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother attacks each other with her daughter and fights for the management of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
At the same time, the 15th Criminal Court ordered a 87-year-old medical examination of Lilian Bettencourt, which should be conducted by the college of three doctors.
The grandfather and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undertake such an investigation, not under the conditions offered by the state representation in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time make a statement whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a weakness and during which period.
I think he'll submit it.
I'll talk to her about this, said Mrs. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
With regard to lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the court’s decision welcomed.
This is an excellent report(...). Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, it has been manipulated (M. Banier).
It has been two years since the only daughter of Lilian Bettencourt initiated a criminal proceeding against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and university who blamed for long-term use of her mother's weakness to get a billion euros in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's images.
Therefore, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be manipulated by a photographer that she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legality of the appeal filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday lawyer’s court spokesman changed the truth into a family hour.
Lawyers Liliany Bettencourt submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to his notebook, in which she expressed her lack of confidence in his husband Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, adds: "You can explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for 15 years once to twice a day.
Since she married, I have never been able to talk to Françoise.”
The State Representation in Nanterre reiterated that the complainant's proceedings were not entitled, more than that the court of caution refused her request to initiate a legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the court, is not under protection or in the care industry.
Nobody else will act for it,” said the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would be expressed at the time of the proceedings.
The Managing Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary.
For more than a decade, it reminds the behaviour of the management of large companies to access businesses to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to identify employees with the "values" determined from the mountain as it was before when consumers had to insert products that came from the technical ideas.
By becoming the customer’s center of business companies, the marketing strategy of acquiring the market was compared in the right direction...and when authoritarian efforts to introduce products different from customer preferences are regularly returning!
The passive approach of employees can lead to mortal demoralization.
Suicidal suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that is mainly affected by managerial chads.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI “requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and ability to predict” and requires from employees commitments that are completely contrary to the revenue of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call on a managerial revolution, which should aim to bring employees to the center of business interest as well as a customer.
Relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys.
Will internal public opinion surveys - as a questionnaire submitted to employees of Orange - contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm worried not.
Especially because I have already convinced myself that the face of a new situation, the structure after different deviations will return to... what she has always done!
Moreover, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionally with the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behaviour.
Because they are graduates of high schools for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Due to the convenience of the mind, they acquire the old behavioral theory, currently revived by “neuroscientists” from the United States and widespread much without greater knowledge by scientific institutions and media.
The fact that it is possible to move the "packed" (sic) involvement of managers has shown a recent survey of the Ipsos agency on the Figaro.fr website, which only determines managers in their position of mechanical management, inappropriate for today’s world.
Identification and measurement of mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses assumes the adoption of a final vision of human behaviour.
It involves inclusion of the basics in all the intentions and practices of management: Employees will only be able to commit commitments to the business if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of motivation of employees is focused only on Motivational Functional Analysis studies.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a pre-defined docs that will allow them to evaluate what they offer to achieve their lives.
Through the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, management workers can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performances" and specify their management of human resources "in the right path".
This creates lively soil for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
A statement from Oslo: “Equitable War” Obama deserved a praise from the right side.
The U.S. right welcomed the speech Barack Obama presented a day before in Oslo, satisfied with the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize holder defending the concept of "equitable war" against the United States enemies.
The Conservatives, who first laughed at Obama’s award on 9 October, dismissed this time the presidential manifestation, including Sarah Palin, former Vice-President candidates in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the right-wing mouse of the Republican wing, for the USA Today newspaper, and added that she itself expressed wars in her memories that are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists have to be arrested there, they think.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the sending of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used the statement to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another Obama’s opponent, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the president carried out a “very good job” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, congratulated by the former President of the House of Representatives, who appreciated mostly the presidential mention of "the existence of evil in the world."
In my own way, I considered this speech totally historic, Gingrich said during the interview in the radio series "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was excited to see the "left president" reminding members of the Nobel Prize Committee that they would not be free themselves and could not give the prize for peace if the use of forces had not existed."
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author George W. Bush, now editor Washington Post, Obama presented a "very American speech".
He not only introduced himself as a “sacrifice” as usual, but “he spoke as an American president” and reminded the Europeans that they live in a safe bubble they didn’t create themselves, and that they don’t do too much to keep it,” Gerson said.
A few of the right-handed disagreements include Bush's era, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, who called his speech as "uniform, uninspired and uninspired", as he said on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is frightened by looking at Barack Obama as he justifies the use of forces.
“When we packed the war into the packaging of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the median-left press holds a praise to the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of peace to Obama prematurely, he assessed his output as a "surpassing" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in combating poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper said.
Obama "pronounced the statement as needed," the New York Times assessed, and labeled the statement "for simple and teaching".
Road carriers: three marathons for an agreement that will save the shipping of stocks for Christmas.
After three operations of marathons, road transporters and TLF, the only employer organization that remained until the end, came to an agreement on Friday evening, which ended the challenge to the stake and the threat that was carrying over the supply of stocks for Christmas.
The Transport Secretary, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" after several negotiations that started on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the debate, the negotiators dissolved early Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible in the morning.
And even though three employer organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting, which began at 11:00 p.m. to agree and at 18:00 p.m. to sign the agreement.
“This conflict would greatly harm businesses” and “the risk of disrupting the holidays at the end of the year,” Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase in salary for the lowest salary (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salary (international transport).
The hourly salary for the lowest salary increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we will give our members orders not to block blocks, no blocks of supply centers.
But there may be more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, welcomed the "correct agreement", although it was difficult to admit high wages increases due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is an agreement of healthy sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also envisages a 3% revaluation of travel expenditure and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow a focus on question 13 of salary and the modernization of collective contracts.
Bussereau reminded of a "$100 million reduction in corporate taxes" which was subject to the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which he voted on Thursday night to Friday National Assembly.
The government asks the Senate for a "decent" vote.
The signing allows this agreement to apply to companies that are members of the organization first, later to the whole range, in the event of the extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible term," Bussereau said.
The whole process can only sound like the disagreement of employers’ organizations.
The FNTR is talking about "bad trade" because €100 million has already been offered to the sector in terms of compensation for a part of the carbon tax.
The State Secretary for Transport has forced us to negotiate an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to distort crust dishes during the nearby Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre’s organization, the agreement will "seize a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months."
Direct trains RER A: interruption of transport for the weekend, trade unions are not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of transport on the line of urban trains RER A, which is the largest city transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday negotiations between the trade unions and RATP's leadership on the second day of the salary did not reach any specific results in the premium demand.
On Saturday and Sunday, i.e. on the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only run between 10 and 20 p.m., on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) each other will run outside this section only one of four trains.
The connection with the SNCF will be discontinued in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to move to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette business houses, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP tried to ensure connection with large business houses".
Line RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris Aglomeration.
The branch managed by RATP takes from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train of two was in operation and almost no competition was running out of the top as it was planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France were organized differently and did not control the disturbances on the stairs.
So early in the morning there was much less people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among other things because students and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he got up "for an hour and a half earlier to have certainty that he will arrive in time."
The Saint-Lazare Station was not overfilled, the SNCF State Railway said, for a larger number of founders and guards were predicted.
Local trains RER A operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut have arrived or left from Saint-Lazare Station with a metro connection.
The next general meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will assess the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the leadership, which the trade unions have considered as "small".
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER trains on all sides, time adjustment, career course, etc.
However, this is not about drivers who demand the merited premium, according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
RATP has even delayed proposals for a premium, which has worsened the CGT by the fact that leadership was "not able to solve the problem while travellers and SNCF did it".
At a new meeting scheduled on Monday, “the conditions of the career performance are closely reviewed,” RATP said.
This was the reason why trade unions think that the company is "making a weekend laughter."
In the mornings, about 150 drivers were occupied by the business committee in his Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far rejected any discussion during the game, has therefore decided to "require" the meeting.
There is a risk that the conflict will spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independent will announce emergency.
The committees request a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independents (Independent)) and are difficult to get worsening working conditions on this line that transports millions of passengers daily.
In advance, RER train drivers earn 2200 to 2700 euros of gross salary and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for irregular work time and for work on Sunday and holidays.
Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision has heavy consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to revoke the main pro-Kurd party in the country. This decision prompted protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can be significantly complicated by the government’s task to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The party for the Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a "below of activities threatening the independence of the state and its inseparable unity," President of the Supreme Court, Hasim Kilic, told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was unanimously adopted by 11 judges, when a majority-seven votes were required to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, and added that 37 party bankers including President Ahmet Türk and Mrs. Aysely Tuglukovic have a ban on participating in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the cancellation of parliamentary immunity by Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the conquest of the party's property to the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 seats in Parliament (from 500).
The party’s leadership already noted before the statute that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political competence.
The decision is the continuation of the proceedings initiated in 2007 by prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the “commands” of the Kurdistan-working Parties (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is the legal political victories of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that it does not have any "fundamental connection" with the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Verdikt of the court comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to restrict the support of the Kurdish against the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP’s leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to the recovery of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a lot of protests against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan has been detained in conflicts with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakiru, a large city in the southeast, mainly in the Kurdish.
The police used tears and aquatic vessels, demonstrators again threw Moloto's cocktails or shot stones from the dust.
Around 100 people have also been demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the Declaration, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice only “desperately deepened.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurds, known as red.) by prohibiting the party, he said in a press release.
The government, which is a party raised from the Islamic movement, has also condemned this decision.
We are from the principle against the disruption of the parties.
Nothing will solve it, stated Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision was completely abolished by the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented politician Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect the response from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK signed up for one of the most murderous attacks on northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to shake citizens, says the head of the Winter Department of FES Technical Services.
But so that his employees can try and learn how to control the entire vehicle technique.
This may happen for the first time on weekends, according to meteorologists.
It is prepared for over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
The FES shall follow in accordance with the precise plan.
As soon as the snow falls in Frankfurt as a whole and temperatures fall below zero, they will go out to 20 so-called sections A large-scale, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and cross-border trails such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for hackers, urban lines of public transport, walking zones and cuts with decline as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins at 3 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to absorb a moisture salt that keeps it better, about 1040 kilometers in a maximum of three hours.
Therefore, the FES starts at three hours in the night, "to make the roads free until the transportation starts to work."
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Department of Technical Services, "because no one is willing to make a place for the crushers."
Only when there isn't so much snow, there are a number of input and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is sideways and sideways.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At 5:00 a.m., the FES will be on the road, cleaning hazardous places and transitions.
FES usually can’t take care of all cycling.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that follows from 22 to 4:30 mostly the bridges, says Brauburger.
As the ice cream is formed quickly on them, the seedlings come out immediately after the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also be called.
A collection of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other mass dinosaurs: The animals long two metres and 1.50 metres high run through two strong back ends, had a long leaf with sharp, stretched teeth, short front ends with slopes and longs.
If this species had lived a few million years later, nothing would be extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday edition of the journal Science write that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these body characters.
The animal lived approximately 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which appeared at that time in the equatorial dry area of the Pangee supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the previous evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about relatives, extensions and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists with Ghost Ranch was launched in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaurs in one day, which is invisible for trias settlements, a team member of Randall Irmis from the Museum of Natural History in Utahu.
Some of the bones quickly identified scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, the remains were collected with a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms the theory of early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sunshine god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitta, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of trias dinosaurs are very rare, usually only individual breaks are found."
Other dinosaurs experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservations.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time approximately 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the breeds were divided into three most important development lines: massage teropodes, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-long" four-nights sauropodi and their relatives, for example, Sterussia.gop, and the triangle Orniysrav.
Tawa hallae is the original therapod after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, the researchers found evidence of air vacuum, which the bird’s descendants have.
Thanks to airbags, breathing birds is more effective than sailors.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the back were apparently filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive thermopad with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative lines of giant sauropods also had airbags and light bones later, this useful innovation has probably already created a common forefather of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs still lived in South America, scientists have led to the first appearance of heroes there.
According to this, three development lines were already divided soon and spread from South America to all the continents that then formed a single earth mass as the Pangea supercontinent.
It would also talk about the fact that the team, along with Tawa Hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related thermopods.
These three cannot come from one common ancestor, argued by scientists.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of scientific studies.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of hardest dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could bring together a broken image, as in South America a lot of primitive fossils of dinosaurs remained preserved, while rarely found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs have proved, from a relatively rare sideline of the breed of beaches, they have evolved to the rulers of the earth in the medieval ages, it remains a controversy.
During the triangle, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as today’s crocodile ancestors and flying shelves and countless other shelves.
Approximately at the end of the trias the dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species developed, while their relatives died and the interface of the trias and the jury.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
Mass extinction could have occurred, which dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the beach did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could push out the competition.
The history of success did not last forever.
About 150 million years later, he helped the meteorite attack to another group of animals, which also developed in the trias, and lived in the shadow since then: the rabbits.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatures are international.
The list includes professors University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley, California.
Students from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paul, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police exile of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt took care of a global disruption.
278 professors and teachers of the Goeth University, but also colleges across Germany, Europe, and North and South America, solidarize with protesters at Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English they “do not approve” the presidency of a police intervention motivated.
Because walls and artworks were honored, University President Werner Müller-Estler lets the building that was held last week by students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the matter, the signatories judge, does not justify “the violent dissolution of self-organized teachings of students and teaching by the police command.”
Release represents "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
Exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unlawfulness and criminalization of protests" and draws attention from content.
The presidency avoided the necessary discussions.
The speakers are calling for a stop of criminal proceedings.
It is argued that most of the emerging have not supported substantial damage.
legitimate protests
The youth of the Verdi trade unions and the German trade unions also solidarize students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says the secretary of Earth youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessen Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has yet to deal with the process of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the University President.
Destruction and destruction are totally unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Actual Hour) in the Wiesbaden Earthquake Hall.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism,” said Peter Beuth, a member of the country's House for CDU.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition fractions of SPD, Greens and Links.
The CDU takes the painted walls behind the back to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, a dismissal occurred.
Linee has submitted a proposal calling for the Interior Minister to report on the police intervention.
New Silicon-Valley
For years it was paid for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union was a strictly guarded location where secret armed research was conducted.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 km from the center of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nano-electronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, Greengrad representatives have linked contacts with the Frankfurt Scientific Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits, and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg the "Protocol on close cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's multi-historic Jurij Rosljak and prefect from Greengrad Anatolij Smirnov, signed by the head of planner Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs will go to a seminar in Greengrad.
Scientific Exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it’s also about economic relations.
FIZ’s companies will be allowed to capture on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientists want to get orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of important Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The period was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist-planned city" for armed research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation "Green City") received its name according to the forested mountainous landscapes in which research facilities are located.
Stuttgart brake
The size of Stuttgart 21 can’t be prepared enough.
For the supporters of the project, this is simply a "new heart of Europe".
Well, the S21 is more than running a station, more than a monster building that will destroy the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade into a desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
The main train stations, which ended in the city centre, were then considered a transport-technical fossil of the 19th century, which acts as the brakes of modern rail transport, as it was necessary enormous time to cross locomotives in the back.
Get over, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work.
This is why the main station leaves: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a tram station located about half of the cross-European rail magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that's why the slogan on "the heart of Europe".
It actually starts with the S21, although the vision of the 1980s is no longer compatible with the reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that the start of the construction is almost unfinancing in the Hessen and Bavarian city.
Since that time, modern sweeping trains with motor vehicles and driving vehicles on both ends, the main station has no longer had problems with walking and departure.
However, it starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE route to Ulma.
This was done by national and municipal politicians.
Others cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are carried out by a taxpayer and not by a state group.
Urbanistically, the project can be excuse in some way.
A new urban space, which – when we trust computer images of designers – will contain a lot of green.
For the railway transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The railway stations and the construction of the trails are intended for passenger transport, which typically attributed a huge increase in the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must, however, first of all, strengthen freight, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than the truck on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for truck trains due to a strong rise.
Even more importantly, the S21 is indirectly affected by many other railway projects.
There were six billion euros to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts are considered to be realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for further nozzle points and narrow places in the network.
There are sixty major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers of the long route along the Rhine Bay.
Since 1987, this route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be necessary to press well here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The crossing of the Rhine valley will become a necklace of the bottle of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the airport's judgment
The Earth government left open to the Wiesbaden National House if it would go against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flight and let it be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has entrusted experts to legally assess more than 400-page VGH judgment, said Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today has written reasons for the state to have to amend the nightly ban on flights in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest ranways of Frankfurt Airport.
The permission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as stated by the government, does not comply with the law governed by the protection of the population against night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if it is required to revise the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged a government representative to reject the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Lipsk.
SPD’s head Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invited CDU and FDP to return to the promises of banning night flights before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to be considered as “infringement of the word”.
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word," the Greens Head of Tarek Al-Wazir said in a strike on the FDP slogan "We keep the word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbela, the country's government attempts to reach its night flight through "covering rights and tricks".
Precise legal control needs its time.
Coalice doesn't want to work on the basis of "fast first impression".
We need realistic decisions, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
The statements of his fraction of banning night flights have never been the same as the opposition gives them.
U.S. Banks Pay Aid
The U.S., threatened big banks are getting rid of state passports.
Bank of America paid on Wednesday aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund to a total of $45 billion (about €30 billion).
According to the report by the US station CNBC, Citigroup also plans to pay state aid.
Thus, constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have resulted in receipt of money - the reduction of bonuses to managers and the repayment of high fees.
The Bank of America acquired 19 billion net money to investors thanks to exchangeable bonds.
The rest of the amount was taken from her cash, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade sales.
Kenneth Lewis, Bank Chief on Wednesday evening, expressly thanked the U.S. taxpayer: Money injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The monetary institution has damaged at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to get rid of its liabilities to the state by acquiring money on the capital market.
CNBC reported that the U.S. bank had already announced an increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
Citigroup did not want to express it.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were already paid.
Quick choice
It just went faster than expected.
The station introduced its successor only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors expelled from the office of chief editor Nikolaus Brender.
Yesterday, we wanted to deal with that person.
Peter Frey was named favorite, the head of the ZDF studio in the capital of Berlin.
However, the station did not confirm it - officially not to anticipate the process.
However, it could also play a role that they did not want to harm ZDF Markus Schächter's intendant if this proposal had not passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs support from nine out of 14 members.
The result of the vote was unknown before the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter laughed at the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
For Brender, only seven members voted, seven were against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a fierce defeat for Schächter, although she could expect.
The majority of the EU in the Board of Directors have already signaled a few weeks before the elections that they do not want to confirm Brender in the office.
The opposition to the chief editor was organized by Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He rejected another resignation in the office of a high-weighted chief editor arguing that behind Brender the monitoring quotas of the reporting broadcast ZDF fell.
Soon before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was criticized.
For the last time, even 35 national law lawyers were included in the debate, who considered Koch's procedure as anti-constitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He worked for Southwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to the ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990; 1991/92 writer in Washington; head and moderator "Morgenmagazins" until 1998; head of foreign policy ZDF until 2001; since then head of the main study ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected by the specialist journal Medium Magazine of the year, was seated, Green announced that they had filed a constitutional appeal.
Koch's counter-candidate in the Governing Council, Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that federal countries should change the state treaty with ZDF so that intendant personal proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender's predetermined successor Peter Frey ordered the Board of Directors with a clever shackle - immediately after Brender's seat he criticized for this seriously.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he could be nominated as the chief editor without loss of his face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the Board of Directors without being suspected that the page would be printed into the office.
In the party's arithmetic, Frey is classified as the left liberals.
The study gets rid of harampage
Partly Success for Students: After a year of standing, the Ministers of Culture finally entered the federal countries on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, both sides agreed that the willingness to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed that the load would be reduced by tests: In principle, each study module should be completed once.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and it should be guaranteed "real and defensive level".
Politicians and colleges want to simplify the recognition of exams between colleges in Germany and abroad.
Federal countries are committed to creating more flexible structural tasks for bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
Earth deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have spoken in their mouths about a better study.
For the first time they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board concluded that the number of tests in part is drastically reduced: "Every module will usually be completed only once", writes in a 30-page report, which in part needs to reregulate the approval of the study fields.
"A far lower test burden," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, "is supposed to be stopped the wrong development that significantly restricted the demand for study."
To this end, the "necessity of study" in the future is a "decisive criterion" for implementation.
Modules and content must be "hardened" to "not necessarily restrict students when choosing"
seminars.”
Students should have a "token to space that enables and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the approval of new fields of study, after review, but also for existing fields of study.
You need to "reaccredit" every five years, but this means it will take up to 2015 before all the curriculum will be reviewed.
There are ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation councils established by federal countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the federal country to act in such a way that the full teaching is not too large and the examination regime is not strict.
In each federal country, universities and universities have already agreed to appropriate measures with the Ministry of the Land.
As the only country to date has promised Porín-Falcko additional funds for further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, colleges should primarily establish advisory programs and study advisory, and strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and colleges want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a novel of the high school law to Parliament.
According to it, only one exam should be required to complete the study module.
The training of the study should be even more flexible, to ensure the recognition of exams from other universities and to facilitate the accessibility of the Master.
By the end of the next year, the duty of all the fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and opposition rediscovered the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to the praise, criticism of the resolution also fell.
The federal leadership of the higher education groups Juso called for the establishment of education policy not to happen in the future "before the closed doors" of ministers and higher education rectors.
At the latest, "at least a word to be spoken" should also be the students as individuals concerned.
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of High School Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need student experience," he said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministry of Culture, with which the HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Committees of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow each graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a building master’s degree.
Secondly, federal countries must ensure that there are plenty of places available for today’s bachelor’s students tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, GEW CEO Andreas Keller said.
Federal countries have to employ much more lecturers.
But the Ministers of Culture did not express free access to the Master’s programs.
More than a note of heritage Müller
To get to Germany and out is beautiful, almost no control..." sounds the introduction line of one poet Werner Söllner, who in this strict language piece has theme of the experience of visiting a disident who has gained freedom, but has also come to his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banate, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and later as a reader of one children's bookkeeper, and then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the leader of the Hessen Literature Forum at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He took care of a significant milliliterary disruption last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and broken mirror of its security acts".
The apparently distorted and infected Söllner left a statement in which he admitted before his colleagues to writers of Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, to cooperate as a secret informer of the Romanian secret service of Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language award in 1989.
The survey attempts began unclearly, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner continued, "someone who hasn't stopped enough from trying to scare the Security."
Poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time with the Nobel Prize awarded by heritage Müller and her unprecedented literary arrangement with the mechanisms of the dictatorship government is a literary scene, and in particular a community of German authors originating in Romania, threatened by a case that marks the depths and the shame of the political system, which consists of control.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only a criminal, but he is also a victim.
In Securitate acts, secret agent Walter played some role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and rejected the positive influence on his secret agent Walter.
"He's got me up in all the important points for him," says Markel.
It has a moral obligation to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in this form and before this audience unexpected, but it was absolutely surprising to admit the former disidence and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own paper, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the mirrors of Securitate.
Touches, which can be assumed, will be speculated, and in some cases maybe know which name is hidden behind the covering name Sorin, Voice, and also Walter.
Unlike in-house, in the meantime a very certain review of Stazi components is still very diffuse to manipulate the remainder of Securitate control.
Over the past few years, systematic floods have been torn and restricted.
One of Birthler’s offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the processing of Securitate components (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of an act has been conducted rather long-term since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law governing the management of components.
That former members of Securitate still have a great influence in Romania, he gave a single interview with Hert Müller after the release of the Nobel Prize, in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Temeshwara rejected the award recipient.
She has a psychosis, but she was finally interrogated only once.
The outbreak of power here has been completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the Söllner case, as well as in connection with the denied crimes, inevitable questions are taken.
The special response of the listeners to Söllner's confession is expecting that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the confession and study.
The genesis of Herty Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a note under the witch.
Satisfied Deposit Champions League
It seemed to come a purely dressed business representative from a cute Christmas party, on which he distributed the manufacturer of sports goods of sweetness, when he appeared four hours after midnight to the appealed mercedes class C new coach VfBr Christian Gross in accompanying an orange-colored spondy bag.
A man with a brand-new dance was allowed to drive after him in another city.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and drunk for luck was a 55-year-old too little.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow will continue to work.
Or it just starts.
The words of the Swiss engaged only three days: "We have reached eight finals," thanks to the Champions League winning 3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we should not let ourselves shake on success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the crash."
“A far more important task” stands in front of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mohuchi even in the usual league day.
And avoid re-obvious weaknesses after the three fast goals of Maricy (5th), Träsche (8th) and the funeral (11th).
Losing
The eight-finals of Champions League (match 16/17 + 23/24 February/match 9/10 + 16/17 March) will take place on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s succession will be preserved.
Not only with the presumed physician who has added to uncertain stuttgart professionals within a short time of self-confidence, willingness to play and joy from the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strong sides, and I urged them to be more bold, explained the Gross soul healer so simplely sounding a successful recipe that but under the influence of Babbel's therapist did not prove any effectiveness anymore.
"When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible," Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann said.
And Sami Khedira, who, after a multiweek break caused by injuries, became the best player in the field right away thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "fresh" phenomenon with the proverb "fresh" wind" and the working practices of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously missing Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart has not been rescued yet, Sports President Horst Heldt warns
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defence of a Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before the defeat of 0:4 in Leverkusena, thinks Khedir.
And sports president Horst Heldt reminded that one goal was achieved in the season, but the other is still far away.
We're not on the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday after his first home victory after three months, it was caused by weekend events that were freshly revived in the form of a television interview with the portman Jens Lehman just before the match began.
There are decisions that are acting by others and not Jens, Heldt denied Lehman's hard criticism.
He preceded the leadership of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of puberty fans.
Even the fact that he was cancelled his free day after the matches, Lehmann named him a sign of missing sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehman's statement "formulates pure egoism," Heldt recalled and announced the consequence for the gates.
Both of them will not have any pleasure in their life anymore.
Anyway, they are behind the other people that without the work of a trainer team, there would be no such player-intensive and fighting performance possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great deal of success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man agrees with the Igelite bag.
World Championships in Heavy Weight
Your duel in Bern: Caller Kevin Johnson constantly provoked words and gestures of the world champion Vitalia Klicka.
However, after twelve hard wheels, the Ukrainian defended his degree in a heavy weight of the WBC boxer organization.
The arbitration was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Kličko remains a world champion in boxing in heavy weights.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klicka, this is the third successful defence of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to K.O.I.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.
Kličko improved his balance for 39 wins in 41 professional battles, twice defeated due to the injury.
The caller Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th battle.
Around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena led a 2.02 meter high Kličko battle mainly with his left.
At 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced before the duel the end of the Kličko's era, but stood before the world's champion's hits, so Kličko couldn't put a decisive hit on his dangerous right.
In total, passive Johnson made little to the caller and tried to get into other bicycles.
The boy, however, triggered words and gestures, but his hits, the world's master, only rarely triggered.
However, it is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klikke full of twelve wheels.
The caller called for a break in the Swiss capital before the war.
He insulted Kick as a "resistance zombie" that "nobody can do well."
During the weighing on Friday, the champion was allowed to provoke, dragging Johnson out of the nose sunglasses, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after the return of Klič
Kličko remained unfinished even after the fourth battle after his return on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of pause, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his "her" WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting before.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomeze from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
In this battle, I got only one wound and I was physically in good shape, reasoned Klichko for a quick return to the ring.
His dream remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt wears but Brit David Haye, after sealing from a 2.13 meter high throne of Nikolai Vulajev in November.
Haye rejected a fight against the Boy who was planned for September in the summer.
Its promotional company is claimed to plan a fight against the Boy at the London Wembley Stadium.
The Kundúz case
Chief of the Greens Jürgen Trittin has named Guttenberg as a liar due to poor information about the affairs of Kundúz Defence Minister.
SPD and Linke (Levice) call on the Chancellor to submit an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest information on the landscape in Kundúz, the opposition believes that defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has made a conscious lie.
The minister told the deadly bombing of two tanks in September "consciously misrepresented," the head of the Green Group Jürgen Trittin said in the ARD "Tagesschau" on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual expression: lies.
The murder order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the news that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was reported that the attack was not only the destruction of trucks taken, but also the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
At the U.S. flight requested by German Commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, NATO investigated that up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, SPD and Linke invited Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Federal Chamber and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Merkel must explain whether the targeted assassination strategy is part of the Afghan Parliament's policy - and whether the Chancellor Office, Bundeswehr and the reporting service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from the Green Renate Künast.
Ulrich Wilhelm has rejected criticism.
The Chancellor’s Office has no effect on the concrete Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also voiced doubts about the ministry's dismissal on the background of the release of Inspector-General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were informed correctly and fully of the background of the attack on the tank.
He officially said they had to deny the existence of NATO reports and deny the minister's sensitive details.
However, in the vicinity of the two top officials, it was noted that the Ministry of Defense had even warned about several reports, including the two-sided document of Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had to request in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any answer yet.
The ministry did not express herself on Saturday and pointed out that this will be addressed in the investigation committee of the Federal Chamber, which will be set up next Wednesday.
The World of Dreams
Some see in the watching state of the image and hear voices that others don’t see and hear.
Not only mentally sick or in drug connections break the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as this happens in sleep, it's all right.
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark room, we should surround ourselves with the wildest ideas and fantasy puzzles.
But whoever experiences a dream warning, sees and hears things that others do not see and do not hear, is mostly a mad or drug-dependent in today’s western world, or at least a strange.
However, such images and voices do not only occur in mentally sick or in drug connection.
Violence has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels are here and there to make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality are broken.
Dreams of changing state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in a better case we call them vision, in worse blasphemy.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the vision of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castanedy, the shamanic condition of blossom, psychosis and hallucination can be removed from similar processes.
Halucination or vision occurs if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters occurs – mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and blurred thoughts occur very often in schizophrenia psychosis.
The gravity does not have much over it.
The connection between blush and sleep has been employed by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood the hallucination as a form of a dream in a state of care, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "a great likeness of blowing with dream conditions", for Sigmunda Freud was a dream even "psychosis, with all senses, confusion, lies."
In the autumn of 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and screamingly colorful.
The gravity has no power over it, it stands at the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling injured.
Behind him, a circle of characters with bloody red grimases, appreciating teeth.
He slaps him, throws into him heavy, fire shoes, throws him on the wall, and feels pain on all of his body.
Voice, bad voices are threatened by walls and radios.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that insult him and insult him.
Henning T. will pull out two cables from the steer, take them into the screw and fix them on the roof.
He stands on one speaker and laughs around his neck.
He's jumping.
The snake permits.
Learn, with a loud voice, he threw his bubbles, "Go to the clinic and let her be healed!"
Today, Henning T. has been 40 years old, having experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
LSDs were launched.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective paranoic psychosis, in addition to it is maniodepressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
I have experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts in psychology, he says.
Miracles are a terrible reality
About one percent of people are sick at least once in life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
With acute schizophrenic psychosis, disability can usually no longer distinguish the inner and external world, reach a disrupted state that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relational illusion or illusion of persecution.
It is particularly widespread to hear voices - voices that command, comment or lead dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The triggered is unable to distinguish the important from the important, the brain cannot filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is flooded by impression.
Like a dream, the psychosis opens the flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior doctor of the clinic of general psychiatry at the Heidelberg University clinic.
Schizophrenik is located in the center of the event, everything is important to it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in the dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenia is therefore often felt threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is mostly not possible, wonders are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchss says, “but the meaningful and spatial structure of the fact that a person perceives in psychosis remains essentially preserved.”
Blud thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the depression of the experience occurs in a real context.
Scientists are still facing a dispute about why our brains are making such transfers.
Exceptional conditions can lead to the short-term losing relationship with reality, Fuchs says.
Not everyone develops into psychology.
There appears to be genetic arrangements for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinant factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development there will be damage to the neuronal maturity of the brain, such as mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, it remains a disagreement about how a failure of the nervous system that has not been manifested for many years.
The roles also play the impact of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychosis if they are available to them.
Also, halucinogen drugs can start psychosis because they affect the transmission system.
When our brain is broken
It’s important that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, pollute expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor Erich Kasten of Psychology from Lübeck.
If we consider overlooking as pleasant or unpleasant, often only a question is the position.
For ten years, Kasten has collected reports on hallucinations and overthrows, last year he has interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (unreal world in our heads).
Halucination belongs to the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also to the surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as border personality or depression, often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, split sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, it hallucinates under certain conditions even the brain of a healthy person itself.
Halucination, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when parts of the brain, in which sensitive perceptions are processed, are too active or little under pressure; if our brain fails, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can start this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also removing stimuli, stress, worry about love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one-third of those asked have experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Meklenburg-Principal Navy and is going to a gym there.
Actually, it's a completely normal girl.
If there were no forms and voices.
On breaks, it can cause her to collapse with long, dark hair.
And when they answered him, they looked at his companions with a surprise - no one except her, and no one heard this boy.
This dirty girl is considered a dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
He wakes up, hears and sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the lion.
He may even feel his presence for at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes that boy.
"I'm crazy?" he asks.
But he knows that this boy and other confusions are not real and will disappear again.
In the night, the revelations are more challenging.
Frequently, overloads are loads.
When sitting in the classroom, he cannot follow the teaching many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears represents a new co-worker, but he explains to all the others hearing and visiblely on the table of mathematical equation.
In the night, the revelations are more challenging.
When he waits in his dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, he can often distinguish whether he is up or whether he is already sleeping, whether the pictures he sees, grimases, or girls with bleeding injuries on his hands and legs occur in front of him with open or closed eyes.
Leave me in the room, screaming on those characters.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends anything about it, they think she's gone crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni made mature and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucination stopped.
Since the time Kasten's psychologist contacted the internet, he knows that she hasn't been crazy.
Depression is also the art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or stimulus is taken away, it will have a high probability of hallucination, Kasten says.
I think the brain doesn't have enough job and cares for its own fun.
Sarah K., the only one, had the fears of other children as a little girl, she often played herself.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at the age of 13 that the man whom her father called since she thought she was not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same areas of the brain that also process real perceptions and sounds are active, it is difficult for disabled as Sarah K. to distinguish themselves from falsehood and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is happening in the brain, reality is also there.
Halucination is also pictures that make the brain develop, so it works so real.”
Also, night dreams evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Halucination of healthy people does not differ fundamentally from halucination in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenicians, mentally healthy people are able to identify their fornications as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises their patients to assess hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world concentrated too much on consciousness, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor of Heidelberg and Chief of Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, patient disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - overlook is also the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called one-eroid form of experience, a special form of changing dream awareness.
Oneiroid conditions are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person considers to be real and can’t even differ from the warning state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation, who experience full consciousness of motor inflammation.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, such as the persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces life threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world that is unconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of border condition between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to cope with a situation, there will be a change in the world, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
The intense form of support for senses and transmission of senses in some intolerant situation, which allows people to have their own ability to form, to move in a moment to loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories.
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his uneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when after surgery with a subsequent heartbeat transplant, his consciousness came out on a several-day journey, while his body laid intactly on an intense care unit.
Claussen dropped into the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an elderly man in bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot cares for his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the shrine that produces dirty substances from the blood.
On the motorcycle, the River takes him into its country, surfers on the hospital bed on a firn in the Alps and meets the Korean mafia.
It's completely in the imaginary, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner paths are essentially different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental roads are clearly clear for years and in unprecedented details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroid conditions, psychosis, hallucinations and drug connections show how cruel our inner pictures are in a state of care for external facts.
Any change in consciousness state, a psychologist Kasten summarizes, "it can lead to deformation of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
In 27 years, children will be charged.
Kallen’s new load manager is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda long-term wants to transfer his business into the hands of both of his children, SPIEGEL said.
Holding will also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The founder Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will be inherited at the age of 27 and willing to enter the business, says 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
Details have been carefully addressed.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only afterwards.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to set up 7500 employees in front of their children unless they are sufficiently capable.
It would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawn from the presidency since January, and named Paul-Bernhardt Kallen's successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors in Burdy since 1999.
First, he was worried about technology.
Later, with the Section, Kashna added responsibility for the property of the company and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, Direct Marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family stands in front of the charger.
The Burd child is 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to “read 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda says.
With regard to Schickedanz and Schaeffler’s cases, Burda said that neither family businesses have any certainty before the destruction: “It has always happened to companies that have left themselves infected with the desire for capital that speculated and thought they could become big players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had a dream of world power,” Burd said.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with Time, these stores are too big.
Complex Beauty Care
Everything you can want in the area of beauty and convenience, you have to reach your hands.
This took place by El Corte Inglés, which just launched the operation of the Callao Shopping Centre (Madrid) with a space of over 1000 m2, providing the various body care services.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, where it is located such a prestigious company as Hedonai dealing with laser depilation-; Spaxión, spaces for relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and more.
There is also a nutritional department and mainly a tea room offering more than 130 different tea types.
You can even enjoy relaxation massages with your partner while enjoying the views of the capital, you can rent a relaxation zone for two hours and provide your own 'beauty party' in the company for up to eight friends, relax in the barbecue, make a massage and a glass of champagne, which are some of Spaxion variants.
It is a total of 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons, in which the above-mentioned services are provided, as well as the most modern facial, body, and hydrotherapy procedures.
As an example, we can point out a cavitation that is used in the fight against cellulite, or vibrational platforms.
The power station is also equipped with these machines, besides virtual coaches, which take care of the individual operations of the customers and thus provide totally individual care.
Everything starts by inserting a personal key to the contact screen that is located against the machine.
Then you can watch the videos that will provide you with the correct implementation of our workouts.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including heating and coating) are sufficient to exercise all muscles.
And if after exercise we like to go to smoking, the company Luis & Tachi has a space where individual hair healing procedures are carried out, improving their brightness and nutrition.
Innovation and exceptionality are the assumption of this city wellness center, which is open every day from 10.00. to 22.00.

Christmas is coming and it’s time to find out what celebrities are wearing, and to customize your festive dress.
The shape of the strip is very important to emphasize the character, which is necessary to be aware.
Let's make a few proposals.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated strip. We do not recommend.
Ending in Barcelona, with electric car
Endesa’s energy company, together with the Barcelona Mayor, founded the Chancellor LIVE.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE Office (Electric Cars Logistics) will set up and run a travel plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure mobility agreements, execute, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to promote this transport means of the future.
3 'Electric City'
Nevertheless, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan government.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous area of Catalonia.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative to participate in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a clearance period in the automotive industry.
President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "clean period".
In the 2009 economic report of the President of the Government, Zapatero summarised measures taken over the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a competitive plan for the automotive sectors, we would expect the state of abandonment, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies today," the President of the Government said.
“Thanks to this plan and to the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace for this industry is expected to be in the future, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, the Competition Plan, which is part of the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), has assigned 800 million to 19 manufacturers and 137 aid companies that have mobilised investments exceeding EUR 3 billion.
The President of the Government explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also emphasized governmental measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and automotive brands.
According to the President, the plan allowed to reduce the average emissions level by 6% in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a "significant increase" of records, particularly in November, by "40 percent."
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classical Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is a place to meet professionals and amateurs from the world of motor vehicles.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Madrid Glass Pavilion Casa de Campo.
This is an exhibition area of a range of 20,000 square meters, representing more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
You will find not only classic motorcycles and cars here, but in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all kinds will also be related to the world of motors.
Exhibitors will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products relating to classical engines, real loans for collectors and assemblers.
Interested companies will include:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialized company.
External eligible tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be supplemented with parallel activities: concentration, sports performances, test capability, presentations and competitions.
Competence tests will also be conducted in classical cars and motorcycles in a customized circle outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preservation of sports style
Mazda intends to show that ease to the environment has no negative impact on sports style.
And therefore, Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start-up system - also baptised as a-Stop-, which is the device, which is currently available with only 2.0 150 horses with a gasoline engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle execution, population, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
The front seats including the driver’s seats have excellent ergonomics and are greatly fixed.
The wheel is also very gentle.
Using the tool and consoles, we conclude that Mazda continues in the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a significant red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that is also presented by Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the rigidity of German products and in particular even more with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage space and regular forms.
The automatic stop and start-up system is available only with a two-liter gasoline engine and a 150-scale axis-step manual transmission.
This engine is a real bottle. It is very soft, characterized by a reduced noise level, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most demanding Mazda3 is in diesel version, all those who do not reach so many miles per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine because it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes a greater number of series elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention above all the system of driving tracking (RVM), which prevents the emergence of dead angle, tax control and stability, speed control, inner light-sensitive mirror, pavilion computer with large screen, parking caps, separate air conditioning, 17-combustion sensor and rainfall sensor and world
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an extra of 1,500 euros: adaptable two-xenon lights and BOSE sound system with a CD holder, in addition to other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
In addition, people who don’t find more miles per year can choose the i-Stop version, which is only with a gasoline engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which amounts to €21.770 in the performance of Luxury and €23.270 in the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'Premiera'
L. A. has a red shirt, soft as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were shaking more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand 'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to browse the mail, without the option of browsing a specific type of apps or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when the Time magazine evaluated it as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it out is harder, but this idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that applies for example on the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanent free data service, but it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-fold amount.
FonPeek, who was introduced to Le Web yesterday, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third change.
It is limited as much as its American counterpart, but it brings surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming across Europe.
People with smartphones already know what it means to come to data services after crossing borders or patiently searching for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) so they can view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, one would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to read the miniature.
The European Commission is constantly demanding to reduce roaming tariffs in order to be accessible to Europe, which still has no sharp effect.
There is reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device like FonPeek (it is interesting that Fon still has a name when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of rate means that operators start thinking differently and consider different offers that would compensate their data network.
Kindle is another beautiful example, offers downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and applies when purchasing, not after months.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting to happen once in the FonPeek case, this is the possibility of purchasing with a permanent approach as Peek already introduced in the United States.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it’s the best type of consumer in terms of consumers.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on the computer.
The color that Michelle loves
Yellow is definitely the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
For the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States, she chose dresses and shoes in this color, and also chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the transfer of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to the fact that it is a similar color - yellow with pink effects -, in both cases it was a classified set - dresses, bags and caps of the same substance - decorated with a large height or leather.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go to the traces of an Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothing is made makes both models significantly different.
At the time of entry to the Michelle function, she used a large shortcut, with a printing unit in Oslo.
Changes also accessories: green shoes with medium-high underwear, modern model, but in golden color.
It also has a variety of hair: this time, before dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Employment discrimination has increased in recent years, especially in women younger than women who want to conceive a child.
This is the result of the study 'Friendness and career of Spanish women' conducted by the CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study took 9,737 women aged between 15 and 75 years of age and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to maternity.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in the opinions of the number of children depending on whether or not they work, and also depending on the type of employment.
Women who don’t work outside of home, work part-time or have no stable job, start living with a partner earlier, early childbirth, and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnership and maternity, are dismissed and have fewer descendants.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have an average of 3.7 years of age from the start of co-operation with their partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have spent most of their lives and have therefore had to delay co-operation and children's arrival.
The type of career also has a strong impact on maternity, although smaller impact on the time of the partnership with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor that affects the age of women at the time of the conclusion of the marriage of an ananaryth of the offspring is the degree of education.
The higher the degree of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the ages of 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education were born their first child at the age of 25.1 vers. 32.1.
“There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to the first child before they find a stable employment, while women with high school or higher education proceed vice versa prefer to obtain a stable employment, before the conclusion of marriage and the birth of the first child,” Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, the German actress will become the faces of various products of this brand under the universal password 'Because I'm worth it'.
The actor 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actors at international level, adds to other famous characters of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penélope Cruz.
Before her, they joined this club by actresses Evangeline Lilly (‘Loss’) and Freida Pinto (‘Millioner of the Chatcher’).
The female part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by prominent characters: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey' anatomie') and Matthew Fox (Evangelinin's partner in 'The Lost').
Prices of British Fashion
The British have a lot to talk about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, formerly and now - met at the annual award transfer held in London, naRoyal Court os Justice.
No one missed at the meeting.
Former Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent donates 30 X-ray pictures of writers in his literary life (and in some cases even in normal life).
He does not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent does not save relief or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s benefit, even when repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as I feel, but it can't be called: the use of antioxidation, morality without guilt and innocentness without any god."
Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, a alegoric Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between power and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, without a sense as if it was a knife that barely killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been given a passion for this woman for thirteen years, cizology, pleasure, and excitement, which is a spiritual privilege for achieving heaven by the way of curse."
James Joyce: "This Odyssea issued in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight thousand tops in universal literature, which must be overcome from the northern side, from which the best horrors will often fall down."
William Faulkner: “It was a strange man.
He said about himself that he was the heir of a county shipyard, once again that he was the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured on the bridge a sharp screaming of this man from Munich to bring his voice to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing himself in front of himself and calling to the future and steadfastly speaking to the herbs."
Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed, 'O my beloved God, let me stop writing as a woman.'"
About Joseph Conrado: "On his grave, Spenser's verse was written: 'A dream will come after an effort, a quiet port will come after a storm, a rest after a war, and death after a full life."
Virginia Wolf: “In his luggage he also took his depression.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her between the Azalms or that the birds were singing Greek.
Never before was a man so patient and in love with neurotics whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
"What else happened to Martin Santos before Joyce focused on Baroe?
What else happened to Benet than to let Baro kill Faulkner's weapon?
What else did the Cell go but to become famous for the celebration of the glory of that man?"
White aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother passed through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrad, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed around and our dog, a cruiser rescued from a cruise with a weight of up to six pounds, without a single word, doubled and severely injured.
Our distraction is bigger than that we see nothing funny in such aggression against a small and unprotected animal that was in addition on the guide.
And for that, the old lady after this incident, when she was confronted with these individuals, she began to worry about her own safety, because with such a devil, a demon-possessed man who attacks the animal, is able to do the same thing with a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at 5 p.m. in the afternoon, Tuesday, in a quiet neighborhood.
The dog was blowing all day long.
We have, of course, filed a complaint to the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was something that was, in order not to raise unpleasant questions, we find that these deceased killers were Spanish nationalities.
The disturbance forced us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with today’s youths when they’re having fun of suffering the unprotected animals that give us love, society and friendship.
We do not understand where proper education has been divided, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helm
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helms, especially in younger drivers, as these two entities informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only way to prevent head injury, even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign is part of their transport safety commitments, which means "more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it is attempting to meet this purpose in the form of an instructive and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of the helmet in the motorcycle ride, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be placed to make the most widespread public awareness.
Finally, Michelin noted that transport safety is a "continuous problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of two-wheeled tyres and its main aim is to increase product safety constantly.
Sales of lightweight utility vehicles increases
Almost two years later, the market of light utility vehicles begins to be remembered.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to the figures of the Anfac patronatal organization of producers and Ganvam sellers.
However, the advantageous data is better to put into quarantine as November 2008 is a significantly bad period of comparison and represents a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, including all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light utility vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick ups, supplies, smaller trucks and light trucks/trucks.
And the clouds that most damage the demand, even though the purchases of private individuals, most of the purchases were carried out by small and medium-sized enterprises, and the average in 100% cases are financing through third parties.
The limitations resulting from the closure of bank loans should also be added to other factors such as stopping activity or continuing the poor economic situation.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the 2000E purchase support was not too helpful.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention individuals undertaking the small and medium-sized enterprises who are planning to buy a lightweight utility truck with a CO2 emission level of no more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvama recalled that special attention must be paid to the management of these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Sellers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to the estimates of sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The manual brake auxiliary system is already compulsory.
As with the ABS anti-blocking system, this will be done with ESP stability management, with manual brake systems, all of which will become compulsory with the equipment of European vehicles.
In fact, they are already part of the compulsory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and lightweight utility vehicles, while others have a deadline for the elimination of the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The EU measures aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, working in a way that can help prevent many precipitations.
The auxiliary manual brake system increases brake pressure in an emergency, which the system will find after the driver crashes.
But it is not always possible to keep this pressure up to the end.
According to a study conducted by the automotive manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers with an accident did not drive the brake before the rain and half of them did not use the brake power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires maximum braking system, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 deaths could be prevented annually related to pedestrians.
The reduction of this number will be even more significant-down calculations would prevent one of four accidents with the impact on the person-on-the introduction of so-called intelligent manual brake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (with the help of a radar or camera) captures obstacles and notifies them to the driver, except for light brakes.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the rain cannot be prevented, the device will affect the brake as intensely as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors Release Plan for Opel in January
Nick Reilly, new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, said the production of the new Meriva will be launched in the first week of the month on April - probably on April 8th - as Javier Ortega reported, the U.S. producer said it would need more time to meet the Opel recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan first agree with the party.
Consequently, the final document, which will be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued by delay at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that the decisions on the sale of Saab should be made in these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but considers the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the protection of the Russian Converg Group.
If it is not possible to deal with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab from the Chinese company Baic.
The decision of Saab to close it at the end of the year is still valid if its sales fail.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this excellent model, Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce their weight by 80 kg, so it shows only 1,275 kg.
Based on this, first of all, the automatic drainage ceiling was in a roller with hand control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; aluminium doors, such as GT3, were further used by an additional 15 kg, which means the removal of 12 kg on additional sports seats, air-conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel seats by 64 kg on additional tank weight.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six pounds less, and replacing door catches with textile catches means another pounds.
It is also offered with a two-way transmission PDK, one vehicle has been tested with a manually classified six-degree speed cabinet, mainly on the second-class roads in California, on mountain cuts with many matching circuits.
His behaviour can only be qualified as intact.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt will not be printed.
Instead, we haven’t tested so small and lightweight model for a long time, which would at the same time transfer such safety when moving in a rotary, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete capable of heating muscles during a short drive for the time required until we order him sprint, brake, and re-use the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the driving that is as communicative as accurate, whatever we point out on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do it with surgical accuracy.
The sound of the engine by will
The V6 boxer sound with 320 horses (about 10 more than Boxster S) is a very measurement and it is possible to strengthen it with the option of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that has already been used in Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it is during sowing or recovering.
The belts are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads that we pass with Boxster Spyder were quite devastated, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some rounds, we were struggling for the lights on the racing and the screw even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-light truck is one of the most fun on the market, as it is something more than just a Boxster S modification.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of €70.831.
"Bag Girl"
The girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, the icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the occasional 'starlette' on the 'firm' views, the singer presents her face of the evil girl as vehemently as her chapels Chanel.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconi has won victory in Israel
She earned a brilliant victory in 82-91 when she hosted on the complex Maccabi Electra square, despite numerous absences in Duska Ivanovice, and thus she became the leader of her group after a large performance Mirzy Teletovice, which with eight three points was the best performance.
The company of Vitorie was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertase, or Mico with a large amount of collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to gain victory.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circle with 16 three points was much involved in the final triumph.
The game started with the front for the blues that started on the mark from the beginning.
The first four baskets for Vitoria were far away, already pointing out that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alawian group decided for the inner game of Barac and the work of Eliyah, which was accepted by sand and potles when returning to its original office to increase the advantage before the start of the pause (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to appear as the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' in Splitter's review has already indicated that this will not be the best evening for Brazilians.
But although the game was sharp until a break, it was not decided even in the smallest and the Maccabeans wanted to remind Vitori that not everyone was winning on their play, and they were able to win by the hand of Elias.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to returning to the proclamation (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead, needed several precise games to breathe, and then Mirza Teletovic came out, who with the help of English and Ribase returned scores to calming number (54-67), which reached local at the end of third quarter (57-67).
The Alavians have been sitting on the skin in the final part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to prepare for the merited results of the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and Splitter, excluded from the faul sevanovic, did not win and defend well, and although the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already lost the winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injury prevents Unicaya from fighting
Unicaya lost significantly in Greece with the Olympics and left him the leadership of the group B in Eurolize in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaya, but above all the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malagy Society did not defeat the Pavilion environment of peace and friendship or opponent, perhaps one of the sick in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusians to dream. Agressive defense and three triangle points each other, two thanks to Omaru Cook and one Guillem Rubia, spread the playground s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unica, although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcis and Schortsanitis, rounded scores 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment the battle between USABeverley and Williams was excluded from both players.
The Greek team began working and demonstrated its prevalence in both zones where the absence of English pivot for the injury of Joe Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jimenez were charged by Unicaj team
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing, Linas Kleizas with three points increased the benefit to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible defence
The third part was very aggressive by the Olympiacos, who lost 19, and was able to overcome the difference in the match in Malaza Malaga 66-48, minutes 27, which led the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unica, thanks to the leadership and three points of Cook and the benefit of Lewise, she left a certain hope of winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to strengthening and overweight in centimeters in his area, proved that it was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to compensate the basket average 81-62, minutes 37, and Unicaja defeated and handed over the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you incubate for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can be familiar with the pay they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, search engines with the largest number of classified real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool How much should you take? calculate the salary of users based on more than 140,000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook where you need to insert a profession, years of experience, age and the city where the beneficiary wants to work.
During the week of the application, the search engine found that the Spanish employee generally “feel badly rewarded,” explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data available for Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spain is the worst payment.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros per year and the French 31.059, while Spain receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a net pay of 34,247 euros per year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain the worst paid work of a cleaner with €11,592 netto per year; followed by a seller with €14,725 and a worker with €15,667.
The most searched network jobs in the last three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil has set Zelay's departure date
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the establishment of Manuel Zelayi at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The chairman must leave his diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010 when his mandate is officially ended.
Francisco Catunda, charger d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he hides from September 21st.
He is aware that on January 27 he has to leave and look for another place of refuge after his mandate has been completed.
The station also cited a former citizen who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before a specified deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said telephonely.
After the elections on November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that she remained at the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get a refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually collapsed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum that he was attempted to impose by the de facto government, which was President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when the inflation of assets represented the dominant mood of the markets, uncertainty again appeared in the markets, which should not be surprised, because it is already a natural state in an environment where operators make decisions on the future, which is uncertain for themselves.
The medication used by central banks to stabilize the market was debt reduction by direct asset purchase and indirect liquidity release in the nearby zero course so that financial institutions could buy assets for deducting.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct asset purchases have virtually been over, and without questioning their uncertain liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a bit of sand into the cockroaches, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we participate in the return of risk revenue reduction.
The mobility of the storms and debt society’s differences have gained points again, although they are still very distant at the abnormal level, as they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risks, which again affected public debt.
The U.S., Japan and Germany have become a refuge for elected investors, expanding differentiation of the euro area countries towards Germany.
This instability has almost been affected by Spain, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction in the qualification of the Spanish Kingdom.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useless to silence the moral risk stakeholders who have tried again to burden the conscience of those responsible for global economic policy because of the devastating consequences of limiting loans to employment, when a new day of gratitude should be declared in fact.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirs for the restoration of power in the emirs, and as regards Greece, we have seen it before.
The government that covers the deficit, elections, and the new government.
He sold it in Italy after Berlusconin and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It is unnecessary that Ecofin saves Hungary from the failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and allows the euro member countries to not fulfill their obligations.
What, however, is logical, is that Ecofin forces the Greek government to transpare and engage its own citizens to share responsibility in the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves before the period of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in supported positions would be within the expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differences will rise as well as European societies' debt bonds, we don't have to worry.
If European differences decrease and our differences continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The issue of Standard & Poor's is just an anekdote. When our leading indicators force most of the services of studies to take over their scenarios of renewal and revise their scenario of rise for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, for the Spanish economy, it is not a great reminder of this.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy a Spanish assets, although at the moment "carefully, driver friends".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene in front of the subcommittee of the Parliament, where Spain’s energy strategy will be discussed during the next two decades.
After his intervention, following the presentation of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galan made a few comments to the press on the proposal that the subcommittee submitted behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million by 2020 and more €60,000 from that date by 2030 if nuclear power plants are currently in operation.
If this does not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola believes that investments should be focused in the next decade not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the issue is changing and will need to increase performance.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that there is need for a new 18,000 MW, but with other "supporting energy".
Galan, who believes that the draft of a Sustainable Economy Act, which the government has just approved, corresponds to the line that the company requested, did not want to live as a royal decree to support national coal consumption, which resists the policy of combating climate change.
According to him, "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "accurate" measure, as President Iberdrol called it.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken already now, as their maturity lasts and a stable tax framework is required for their launch.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of preferential company of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for cost services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are one of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet expired, has expired for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a Protocol on Cooperation to establish a Center for Intelligent Innovation
The Association is expected to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which belong to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be energy efficiency research on roads and airports.
Acciona seeks its first route in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona struggles for her first concession on the road in Australia, which is a market where she is already working as an energy and aquaculture company.
The building is estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,47 million euros).
Her competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the eastern coast has become the nearest possibility to establish Acciona in the country as a construction and concessional road company.
Workshop wants to have a tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP) for further development of the project in the Erns & Young business plan, the administration has already a final list of candidates for building and operation of the property.
The proposals are expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (EUR 1,047 million) and at the last stage, three companies with a significant presence in European buildings will compete.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second with its headquarters in Italy is one of the largest European underground specialists.
The Northern Direct group is in the game with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield infrastructure manager and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last group that has passed the network is LBRJV and participates in the Australian capital Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (own of the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a significant company specialized in civil construction Raz.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatization, but it bears with it a clear difficulty to enter in in a different way than by intermediaries to acquire local construction companies.
The strategy managed by Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector in addition to Asian references.
ACS has gained a market position through its 30% share in Hochtief, the cited owner of Leighton.
Million Assets
Acciona puts on a geographical area of the most important importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy suppliers’ activities and in the delay trade.
Apart from the assets, Waubra's largest wind park (192 MW) in Victoria is the leader of a group of companies that build and manage discharge facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the building and infrastructure operations areas.
The underground route, which is promoter of the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, called Northern Link (Northern Link), is intended to connect the western route from Toowong with the surrounding route to Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of the tunnel. This is the largest deal for reducing the traffic overload Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration plans the tasks for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would be opened in the last months of 2014, full completion of the work is scheduled to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began projecting in 2005.
It will include two currents in each direction, an electronic bulb system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane has already offered this deal Hochtief
Australia still brings significant gains because it announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million yesterday.
Part ACS will operate via its local Leighton subsidiary the national broadband network infrastructure with optical fiber cable.
This will allow fast access to the Internet to 400,000 people and provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the 27-storey building project of King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia. The construction work had only started and Hochtief closed sales for 129 million.
In the UK, particularly in Manchester, Laing O'Rourke will participate in the construction and operation of two school centers for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC has been allocated for 64 million tunnels in Slovenia
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been allocated a 2.1 kilometre-long tunnel building for a trail in Slovakia worth EUR 64.5 million.
The company received a contract for a few days after its work on the expansion of the tunnel in Bosnia (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, the Alpine strengthens its experience in building tunnels.
The start of the work is scheduled to begin in 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore received advertising in Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services to Mrs. Rushmore in the last two years for about three million euros a year, the railway operator said.
Mrs. Rushmore was elected among the 16 agencies who appeared in a Renfe-written competition, four of which were held in the final, including the TBWA, which was responsible for the creation of advertisements over the past three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
63 million proFrance Télécom penalties for competitive braking
The French Competition Regulatory Authority has imposed a fine of €63 million lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator restricted the competition of solid and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs to consumers on the edge of regulation.
The former French monopoly and the state company have still purchased more than 560 million euros since 1994 for imposing barriers to its competitors.
The appeal set yesterday was de facto increased because the supervisory authority believes France Télécom has committed a similar crime as in the past, and therefore a relapse has occurred.
App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an internet app store to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
Since the beginning, Orange apps have been active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
The Champions League has brought 476.4 million Madrid and Barça from the beginning.
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, making it the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is managed by Manchester United.
The list is managed by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided 5,362.5 million euros into 105 associations (of which 12 of them were Spanish), which participated in the event since the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona went out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he won for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won three times the main prize.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the disappeared European Cup in 1992 are in the fifth classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two teams, who also charged the most money for participating in the previous Champions League.
And even though they both lost Barço.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has earned the most money through Champions, although it has earned the most titles from all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex method of money distribution used by UEFA.
For this financial year, Michel Platini’s Chairman is planning to earn 1,090 million for the Champions League.
The UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the preliminary classification wheel (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who reached the participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to additional €550,000 for each match to participate.
There are also premiums for winning (800,000 euros) and remises (400,000 for each team). Eight finalists get three million each; eight quarter finalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets four million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist earns 5.2 million.
This is how the club earns at least 7.1 million and up to 31.2 million in fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for the European Super Cup victory in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which 337.8 million are allocated.
The money is divided according to the relative value of each TV market.
The Spanish is one of the main and has four seats.
The champion of last year will receive 40% of the money, the second 30%, the third 20%, and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% Sos
Yesterday, Nueva Rumasa announced the details of the purchase of shares, with which she wants to get a top place between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
This percentage does not undertake to make a public tender for the acquisition of all securities (options).
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share to pay in ten years and for which interest would pay for this deduction 1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos’ shares concluded trading at €1.85; therefore, Nueva Rumasa offers 18% below the market value of the company.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of €1.50 reflects the actual value of Sos.
The offer is provided by the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez Group provides a deadline of 15 days to inform shareholders of their interest in selling the share.
CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it was linked to the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to change the structure of his leadership.
As an attempt to maintain on the edge of possible offers to purchase and compensate the court demands of his former leaders, Jesus’ brothers and Jaime Salazars, Maria Luisa Jorda was announced as the head of internal audit.
This decision makes it the first woman to have a high role in a food business.
This is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company is still invaded in a legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos brothers of Salazar.
De facto, the possibility that Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the coming months
With regard to Salazar’s credits, former members of the Council of Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja) spoke to the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were destined.
CNMV allows the option to exclude the Patternine participating Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion with the participation of Inversor Mer against Federic Paternin on October 9.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorized this operation as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards, and believes that it is "suficient" to explain the brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
CNMV explained that the offer was aimed at obtaining 550.008 shares of Federica Paterniny at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is composed of 6,142.786 shares taken to trade in stocks in Madrid and Bilbao.
In addition, it explained that 5,592.778 million shares were deducted, which would not be able to be transferred in any way until the offer has been concluded, specifying that the price was determined by Federice Paterni in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New Car Assessment Tools
These days, storms and accidents don’t just make self-services.
Every day, thousands of cars who suffered from an insurance event are thrown into a service where the expert has to estimate damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and workforce time can be long and complex work.
It can take two or three hours to calculate the manual cost of fixing from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and workforce.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a question of minutes.
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The providers of services and solutions to estimate insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain, Audatex is a leading company from the U.S. Solera group; 80% of its products are reviewed.
Other companies that compete in the fields of evaluation and development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázqueze, business director of Audatex, we work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the quantity of data for processing is increasing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the past five years than in the past fifteen years.
Once the new vehicle comes into the market, these companies will start working.
This is a very hot job, because each one of the thousands of parts of the vehicle needs to be catalogued and set its price.
In addition, each model performs "intelligent" graphical processing", where it is possible to "discharge" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
When it comes to a model with massive sales, work can be finished in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models of information are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
Over 99% of the car park in circulation.
Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for documentation and processing of databases and each specializes in specific brands.
National headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than one hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) working with three computer screens at the same time.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are classified each month and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this extraordinary stream of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common use focuses on repairs and maintenance, but according to each country there are also spare parts management tools or for the calculation of the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide to informing the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not offered in our country, but in the United States yes.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain support that professionals in the sector can take advantage of.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, the standard insurance event award solution designed for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and lightweight and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes time for repairs estimated by the manufacturer or layer.
This tool applies according to use for each review.
The highest price is €5.75 for customers who use it fewer than ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that performs thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which the installation line is out only on the basis of the first number of the conveyor.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to a professional sector on the Internet that allows you to explode vehicles with an overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analysis or finding deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model brands have been serving due to an accident or how many serious insurance events have suffered for a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, Gt Estimate sells, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa company founded in 1971 as a service provider and car damage, accidents or maintenance assessment.
Gt Guía Awarding is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in service, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover increased by 20% annually over the last three years and accounted for 10.8 million euros in 2008.
In the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the installation of the office in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its brother is founded in Europe and 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global invoice of Solera Group (Audatex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera’s stock exchange was $1,000 million and its shares are now estimated at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, she has been quoted at the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of fraudulent vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an internet base for sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation was expected to account for €59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The goal of the purchase was to provide more added value services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This price and purchase and sale service is handed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, leasers, services, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who have to register before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily advertisers and approximately 100 new advertisers are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, the car, the number of the conveyor was excluded, cannot return to operation, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they were excluded, after pre-driving.
The budget of the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in only four steps: vehicle identification, replacement search, budget ageneration.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of senior professionals who are more or less sustainable when using new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, including 666, 109 fields, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
Naturally, you need a computer with a connection to the Internet.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the header number, the real graphical display of the model will appear, and then the necessary replacement parts will be selected.
The user may include variables as a price of workforce, extras or discounts, and then print and transmit to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include estimates of labour force.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is €350 per year that the customer can finance.
Currently, Audatex is working on making this view three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that mechanics welcome because it will allow for, for example, to choose the door and rotate them to appear on the inner side.
