A rapidly expanding coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The growing spread of COVID-19 cases shows a similar process in countries of the European Economic Area/EU, and the UK confirms that we are in different countries at a different stage of all-conflict, but the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, other countries, hospitals and special care departments should increase their preparedness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need special healthcare and special care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of incidents were reported for unknown causes in Wuhan Hobbie Province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Control and Prevention of China’s Diseases reported the cause of this factor as a new type of coronary virus called Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called coronary disease (covid-19).
The evidence that has been found to date shows that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a malaria disease, i.e., respiratory infection with or without swelling, and most of them are getting better.
In approximately 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more severe disease that requires hospital burning, while 6 percent of the remainder experiences a freezing condition that requires special care.
The death of patients in the hospital is about 4% due to COVID-19.
In this study, we evaluate the growing spread of the coronavirus in each of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and compare them to the Hobbie province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK, with the number in Italy from January 31 to March 15,202.
Covid-19 Cases in the EU/EEA and England
After China, COVID-19 has been published in more geography, and the poetry of this disease is now being trapped in all other parts of the world.
On March 11, 2020, the Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
Spiteri and his colleagues in the Eurosurveillance magazine reported the first approved cases of COVID-19 in Europe on March 5, 2020, based on the definition of the World Health Organization.
Three cases were reported in the EU/EEA approved by France on January 24, 2021 by people who returned from the Hobbie province of China.
On March 15, 2020, COVID-19 incidents were identified in all 30 European/EEA and Britain (UK), which resulted in 39,768 confirmed from 31 December 2009 to that day, and reported 1,768 deaths from 11 May, and only 17,75.
Achievement of Covid-19 Relationships and Relationships
In the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), COVID-19 cases in various countries around the world only come from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Organization and the World Health Organization, which are updated every morning at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to evaluate COVID-19 process in the European Union/EEA and the UK and compare it to the disease process in Italy.
As an indicator for the spread of COVID-19 active cases, we calculated the spread of COVID-19 collected cases in 14 days, and as a result, the natural COVID-19 period was considered in the EU/EEA countries from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
The number of cases reported from each country was also compared to Italy reported cases from January 31 to March 15, 2020 at 8:00 p.m.
COVID-19 in the European Union/EEA and England
The 14-day process of breaking the COVID-19 Assembly in the EU/EEA and the UK generally follows the Hobbie Province (China) (Section 1).
In general, for the European Union/EEA and the UK, the COVID-19 Assembly’s expansion began to increase on about 21 February, and then significantly increased on about 28 February 2021 (complete content).
This is mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increase in the process of spreading COVID-19 (complete claim).
Figure 2 shows the number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and England compared to cases in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
This indicates that the total number of cases reported in 15 other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK was comparable to the number of cases in Italy in 3 weeks before or less.
Our results suggest that the number of cases detected by COVID-19 is rapidly rising in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The processes observed in the COVID-19 assembly show that this pandemic is currently developing at almost the same speed in all countries.
While countries are in various stages of disease, public health organizations’ reactions vary, and there are probably different definitions and protocols in countries to select patients to be tested for COVID-19 approval, including an increase in test speed.
In early March 20, doctors in areas affected by the virus in Italy described the situation in which about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed special care and media sources reported that hospitals and special care departments in these areas were at their maximum capacity.
Information about the admission of COVID-19 cases in the hospital or special care department currently at the EU/EEA level is only available for 6 percent and 1 percent of cases (data has not been shown).
In order to complete the current monitoring data that focuses on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths, this information must be collected systematically.
A study conducted during the 11-2010 years showed that access to special care beds in Europe is very different, from 29.2 beds to beds per 10,000 in Germany to 4.2 beds to beds per 10,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have less or more resources than Italy (12.5 special care beds and average care for every 100,000 population in 11-2010).
Modeling scenarios relating to health care capabilities, with estimates for different countries of the European/EEA and the UK regarding the spread of COVID-19 cases that have been built in the hospital in connection with occupation of more than 90% of the capacity of EC-19 special care departments.
Since disease cases are classified in certain regions of European/EEA and England, and hospitals and special care departments usually serve the population of a region, so information about disease cases and special care beds should be preferably on the list of local units in the UK.
The experience of Italy and the current process in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Therefore, hospitals and special care departments must prepare themselves for a sustainable SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need special health care, such as situations occurring in Italy’s affected areas.
As noted in the recent ECDC risk assessment, a quick, preventive and comprehensive approach to delaying the SARS-COV-2 expansion is necessary with a rapid change of the prevention approach to decrease, as the prediction of the rapid increase in the number of cases if this is not done too early, can cause the decision-making authorities to respond in sufficient time.
Quick risk assessment lists public health measures to reduce the impact of this pandemic.
A short opportunity remains for countries that can increase their control measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 emissions and reduce pressure in the healthcare sector.
The failure in this matter will likely face the healthcare system of other EU/EEA countries with a wave of patients that will need special care over the next few days or weeks.
The spread of Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) caused by the respiratory hardening syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), leading to more than 30,000 deaths and contamination of 80,000 people in China and other areas of the world, which are a disaster for humanity.
The SARS-CoV-2, similar to the same virus, which caused thousands of people in 2003, may have been transferred from the swallows and may cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less intensity and mortality than Sars, but its transferability is greater and affects older people more than young and men than women.
In response to a lot of content published about this disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive survey of this rapidly expanding research topic.
We will cover the initial principles of epidemiology, causalology, virusology, diagnosis, treatment, pre-advertising and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help to understand and root this disease.
On January 25, 2020, the festival became an unforgettable memory for all Chinese who had been forced to stay all the holidays at home due to the spread of the new virus and several weeks later.
The very similar coronavirus (CoV) virus, which caused the spread of the hardened respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the virus was called SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2021 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and also called CoV Disease-19 (Covid-19) associated disease.
The epidemic began in Wuhan China and rapidly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, of which more than 40,000 have been licensed and more than 30,000 have died.
The World Health Organization has warned that COVID-19 is “the enemy of a person” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on January 7, 2020 in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 specifically include virusology, epidemiology, body-separated viruses, multiple-cause, diagnosed, and therapy.
In this browsing article, we strive to accumulate research advances in this new and rapidly developing topic.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, found in 2012).
We will also discuss the events we have learned about the prevention and treatment of this disease so far as to discuss some other essential questions.
CoVs were traditionally regarded as non-mortal pathogens for humans, mostly leading to approximately 15 percent of normal colds.
But in this century, we faced a lot of human disease, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the spread of the disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and very early with the severe spread of death and death, spread to many other countries.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV in the history of humanity.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a number of unknown origins have been reported to the Chinese National Health Commission for the first time on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV was released.
The first deaths of Wohan were reported on 15 January 2021.
At the same time, the epidemic quickly expanded to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, the Department of Health Care was reported and showed that human transfer to humans is possible.
On January 23, the inhabitants of the city of Wohan were deported in Quartin and public transportation stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study reported that from among 41 patients with cases of confirmation, only 21 were directly contacted with the seafood market, which was considered the starting place of infection from an unknown animal source.
The World Health Organization announced that the pandemic was an emergency on 30 January.
Until the report was prepared, the disease has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (former 2).
Since the situation is rapidly changing, the final scope and intensity of the spread of the disease is still a problem to be determined.
On February 11, 202, a study conducted in several centres of 8,866 patients containing 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases showed the image more up-to-date of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People with SARS-CoV-2 are different, but mostly 30 to 65 years old.
Almost half of the patients (47.7%) were over the age of 50, the number was very small, under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
People with SARS-CoV-2 are more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has been widespread mainly in the hub and around it.
The start period to COVID-19 was on average 5 days (2 to 9 days).
The average weekly period of disease was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2).
The start period to death was an average of 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
Based syrup number (R0) was equivalent to 3.777 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 was adjusted from 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people with representation increased before January 23, 2020, according to the time of transportation, before the Bahrain Festival in China.
The death rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted death rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (men), age (more than 60 years) and severe gender.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and vulcano viruses that contain a unique RNA sensitive discipline.
These viruses can be divided into four levels of Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, which can be transmitted to humans by various types of Alpha and CoV beta.
The glycoprotein (S) is connected to the host cell angiutensine and causes the conversion of enzymes 2 (ACE2) and peptide 4 (DPP4) sorted for SARS - CoV and MERS-CoV, and then occurs coagulation.
The RNA virus is released in the cytoplasty; after the reproduction of the virus RNA, the RNA is produced by the glycoprotein and the proteins of the nucleocopsis containing the virus, which then connects to the plasma spray to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
According to genetic compliance, more than 99/98% of the total samples collected from the main location of the flood, namely, the air-based food market in Wohan, found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transient electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the superficial surface of human air flow covering.
The ACE2 human functions as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, S protein from SARS-CoV-2 is weaker than SARS-CoV to human ACE2, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a hidden protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in IFNβ virus disease. However, orf8 has no known domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and EM co-workers reported human ACE2 complete length with clarity of 2.9 Angestrom in combination with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that this combination, which had open and packed joints, was combined as a dimmer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 combination can connect two proteins of S, which can be evidence for detection of CoV and infection.
B0AT1 can be converted into a treatment target for the drug removal of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Menu and hosts
It is evident that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both the cavities and are typically transferred to humans through the cats and camels.
By comparing the philosophy of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the SARS-CoV-2 hosts are 96% of the new virus with two semiconductors of CoV is the same as they originate from SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
Nevertheless, the question that the median host helped the virus to pass through the disease of species to contaminate humans is unresponsive and the pathway of transmission is still required more clarity.
J and colleagues believe that the residues containing a homogenous compound in protein S have acted as a pregnancy of the virus from the swallows to humans.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou China, based on 99% of the genetic associates discovered in CoV in Pongolin and SARS-CoV-2, reported that maybe eating pongolin - a kind of long-established mushroom that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine.
However, 1% of the difference in the two genomes is still a great difference; so we are still waiting for certain results for evidence (form 33).
Chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV live in a dry environment of up to 48 hours and at 20 degrees centigrade and humidity of up to 50 percent and up to 5 days in laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be fiber radiation and temperature of 65°C for 30 minutes, ether, ether, ethanol 75%, anti-infectants containing chlorine, plastic acid, chlorofrom and other fat solvents other than chloroxidine. This is inactive and can be
The human population generally has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore ready to begin with the new virus.
A thorough study of immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been reported.
In this way, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. (Figure 4) 4.
In general, after an attack on the host cell, the virus is initially recognized by the host's original immune system through model detectors (PRRs) including type C semiconductors, semiconductors Toll (TLR), NOD semiconductor (NLR), and semiconductors RIG-RLI.
Through various pathways, the virus causes the emergence of inflammatory factors, the prolongation of dendritic cells and the interferon type synthesis (IFNs), which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the microfocus in antigen.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help escape the virus from the immune system.
The immune system is very early in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific viruses, and CD8+T cells directly kill infected cells to the virus.
Helping T cells are treated to help protect from cells in the production of anti-inflammatory cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells with an apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral safety includes supplements such as C3a, C5a and antibody are also essential in combating viral infections.
For example, a separated antibody is improved from the patient, causing MERS-CoV distortion.
On the other hand, the excessive reaction of the body’s immune system leads to the production of a lot of free radicals in a position that can cause severe harm to the lungs and other members and, in the worst scenario, leads to a number of members and even deaths.
SARS-CoV-2, which is the characteristic of its bulky appearance, affects more elderly people with background diseases and pregnant women.
The common topic is that people who are exposed to a lot of viruses or their immune system function is weaker than others are more likely to be infected.
Based on the study on the first 455 cases in Wohan, the SARS-CoV-2 weekly period was determined at a rate of 14-1 days, but in most cases it takes 3 to 7 days.
However, a study on 1,999 shows that the weekly period is an average of 3 days and the interval is from zero to 24 days.
The latest study shows, as explained above, that the weekend period is 4.8 days (0.3 to 7.2 days) which is based on statistics of 8.866.
This is very important for health officials to be able to determine effective quarantine time based on the most accurate weekly period, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected people who do not have symptoms of the disease to others.
One method is that people who are exposed to the virus or infected should usually be infected for 14 days.
Should the period of quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and initial sign of COVID-19 which can be accompanied without any signs or with other symptoms such as dry headache, breathing, muscle pain, anxiety, headaches, chest pain, seizures, chest pain, swelling, swelling and eruption.
Some patients suffered breathing depression or oxygen reduction in tissues a week after the disease began.
In severe cases, the disease rapidly leads to severe respiratory syndrome, spatic shock, metabolic acidity and blood flow disorders.
Patients with fever or severe respiratory and fever symptoms, even without rivious insufficiency in radiology images, should be detected for early diagnosis of the virus.
A population study at the end of December 2019 showed that 98% of the symptoms were fever, 66% of the fever, 55% of the breathing and 33% of the depression; 88% of the patients needed a ventilator.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of a family-run and a family-run resulting from the transfer of a person without a sign.
A population study conducted in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV are also seen as the main symptoms of fever (98%), dry headache (47%) and respiratory anxiety (55%).
However, 80% of them needed a ventillator that is much more than COVID-19 patients, which indicates that MERS is more deadly than COVID-19 patients.
Rainfall (26%) and glucose pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, it has been shown that fever (99 to 10%), dry headache (29 to 75%), breathing depression (40 to 42%), swelling (20 to 25%), and glandure (13 to 25%) had the main symptoms, and approximately 20% to 14% had the need for the machine.
Until February 14th, and when the cases were confirmed at the global level to 66,576, the percentage of death and COVID-19 were approximately 2%.
In comparison, the SARS death rate was confirmed by about 10 percent of 8.966 in November 2002.
According to a population study in June 2012, 37% of MERS’s confirmed death and death were calculated.
One of the previous studies shows that R0 relates to SARS-CoV-2 to 6.47 and the assurance distance of 95 percent (CI) is approximately 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 range for SARS-CoV is only from 2 to 4.
The SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV is presented in Table 1.1 in terms of symptoms, death and death.
The above pictures show that SARS-CoV-2 has more capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but SARS-CoV-2 is lower than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
This order of control of all SARS-CoV-2 is much harder than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of a cruise often occurs in a family or from a place of assembly or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have two weeks before the start of the disease, travel history or stay in Wohan or other infected areas or contact with infected persons or patients.
However, it has been reported that people can be viral without symptoms, more than two weeks, and patients who have been improved and licensed from the hospital can also retransmit this virus that is a warning for an increase in quarantaine time.
In the initial stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lenucity) in patients is natural or low.
For example, the state of Lymphony with a white blood glucose number of less than 4×109/L included the number of lenocytes less than 1×109/L, and the levels of aminotransferase aspartate increased and the presence of the virus in the blood was observed in 1,999 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myglobin in the blood have increased in some patients, and the C reaction proteins and red glucose rise in the blood have often increased in patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D levels of dimer, which is the result of fibroid destruction in the blood, have increased and the number of lenocytes has gradually decreased.
Uncertainty is seen in the radiographic images of the breastplate in most COVID-19 patients, and the characteristics of these two-sided shades or the culture of mat glass in the lungs.
In most patients, unnatural rheumatism, severe lung injury and severe respiratory dystrose syndrome (ARDS) is caused.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, advanced liquid accumulation and fibrosis puts the individual’s air exchange at a severe risk.
The functioning disorder of type I and II in pneumonia leads to a decrease in the level of surfactance and increased surface tension, resulting in a decreased lung ability to exacerbate and increased the risk of lung falling.
Therefore, the worse the radiation findings of the breastplate, the broader the spread of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed a breakthrough of pneumonia, an inflammatory glaciation and inflammatory inflammatory inflammatory membrane and multiple cells of the cylindrical cylindrical cells in SARS diseases and MRS diseases that have been affected by disease and infection.
The RNA diagnosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 was used by the chain reaction of the polymerase-round mixer (RT-PCR) as the primary criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the negative rate of this method, which could accelerate the epidemic, the use of clinical symptoms (which no longer relied on RT-PCR) began to diagnose the disease in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation has also occurred for the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and radiological findings is to have an effective, essential and mandatory diagnosis.
On February 14, 2021, the Feng Jeng Protocol Group proposed using CRISPR-based sherlock methods to identify SARS-CoV-2, which requires the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 combined RNA components at a minimum of 10-18 mol/L at a precise one-hour drive from 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L.
It is hopeful that a new method can be seen in clinical samples greatly increases the precision and convenience of testing.
Given the lack of experience in this new type of CoV, doctors can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while various treatments that are used to improve other CoVs such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other virus diseases are recommended. (Table 2.)
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immune system contraceptive drugs, steroids, improved receiving plasma from patients, Chinese medicine and psychiatric support.
Even the receiving plasma from patients has been recommended for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing for the production of vaccines and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and possibly has weaker attacks on other members with ACE2, such as swallowing and joints.
However, performance disturbances and failure of the respiratory system are the most important risks in patients’ disruption and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support to relieve symptoms of disease is vital and saves a person's life, which, depending on the severity of disease, can include general therapy oxygen, high-stream oxygen, non-invasive ventilator and mechanical ventilator.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by oxygenation of bronchial oxidation (ECMO), this method is a corrected post-cardiopathic technique used to treat heart failure or respiratory disorder.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and hypothesis and protecting the function of vital organs is also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been revealed that the storm of sitocine is obtained from excessive reactions of the body’s immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The storm is a kind of systemic inflammatory response that features its release of a series of cytoxins including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
This citocine leads to immune cells that will release a lot of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organic insufficiency.
It is essential to break down the immune system in the treatment of sitocine storms, particularly in patients with fatigue.
Corticoasteroïdes and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used for the treatment of sitocine storms.
Other treatments for the breakdown of the immune system in order to prevent the storm of sitocine are the immune response modulation directed by T cells; IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF, JAK inhibitors; bilinatoms; sitocine 4 symptoms transmitter and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as immune system suppressors in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
However, the use of steroids in high doses in severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19 was not useful.
Instead, it may cause severe side effects, particularly the Ivacular Steoncrose, and have a dramatic negative effect on the improvement of the disease.
However, short-term use of corticosteroids in low-to-average doses is recommended to be used with caution for COVID-19 patients who are in free condition.
At the time of his pronouncement, no effective antiviral treatment has been approved for this disease.
However, it has been revealed that the intervention in the urine with remdesivir, which is a neurotic analog, has been effectively found in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug produced by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Abola and Marlburg viruses.
Possible inhibition of other single-range RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS, was subsequently shown by remdesivir.
On this basis, Gilead has sent the combination to China to carry out a series of tests in infected people with SARS-CoV-2 and was very hopeful.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are recommended as a potential treatment for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Sickness, swelling, eruption, liver damage and other side reactions may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The intervention of this therapy with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma Receiving Patients Improved and Antibody Production
Blood taking from patients who have improved from an invasive disease to help other patients who suffer from a similar disease or protect healthy people from a disease has a long history.
In fact, patients who have improved often have relatively much antibody in their own blood to deal with the disease factor.
Antibodys are immunoglobulin (Ig) that are produced by linfocytes B to fight disease factors and other foreign objects and detected unique molecules in pathogens and directly dilute them.
Based on this, plasma was received from a group of blood patients who had improved COVID-19 and was injected into 10 patients.
Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reducing inflammation, viral load and improving oxygen abuse in the blood.
However, before specific treatments are offered, the use of this method requires a large scale of approval and transparency.
In addition, depending on the therapy effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodys can exacerbate the immune response too much and create the cytoxin liberation syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening poison.
The blood pressure is usually low and the plasma demand for patients is too much for treatment.
It is difficult to prepare and produce fast-trained pedants that are sufficient to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, B cell separation from patients is improved and detected genetic codes that encoding pathogens or effective pathogens against primary virus proteins, more important and more useful.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of bulbs.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat all kinds of diseases in China.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of different components in the formula, which depends on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of its effective ingredients are still unknown or unknown, because extracting and confirming these ingredients or their optimal combination is difficult.
At present, TCM has become one of the important treatments for patients with mild symptoms or patients with median symptoms or those who have been severely improved because of not effective treatment for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were effectively identified in COVID-19 treatment.
The highest rate of treatment was observed in COVID-19 patients in several provinces of China, in which 87% of patients used TCM, including in Ganso (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Honan (50%). The most observed in Hubei province was observed in only 30% of patients used COVID-19 in TCM.
However, this comparison is not entirely correct, as many factors such as the number and intensity of patients should be assessed.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study for the comparison of Western Treatment (WM) alone and the combination of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for the recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and loss in a group treated with WM+TCM was notably shorter than a group treated only with WM.
Surprisingly, worsening symptoms of disease (from light to severe) in the WM+TCM group was less than WM+TCM group (7% compared to 46%) and death rate in the WM+TCM group was less than WM+TCM group (8% compared to 9%).
However, the performance and safety of TCM is still waiting for better controlled tests on larger scales and more centers.
The determination of the entrepreneurs and the specification of the effective components of their TCM treatment or compounds, if possible, is a subject that has stimulated the curiosity of scientists.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often have a lot of fear of this disease and even deadly, and quarantaine people are also suffering from selfishness, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of this infection, such as fever, hypoxies (about oxygen in body tissues), headache and side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticoasteroids, can lead to increased mental disturbance and anxiety.
In the first phase of SARS, various psychotherapy effects have been reported including severe depression, anxiety, nervous attacks, mental-moving tensions, mental symptoms, injury, and even suicide.
Obviously and quarantaine contact tracking, as part of the method of the general health system to combat COVID-19 spread, can disturb people with regard to the effects of surge, quarantaine and pollutation among their family and friends.
Therefore, psychiatric care should be prepared for COVID-19 patients, suspects, people in contact with them, as well as the general public.
Psychiatric support should include the creation of psychiatric teams from different disciplines, transparency communications with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 distribution, therapeutic plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.
Efficiency vaccines are necessary to cut the chain of transmission from the population of vacuum and contaminated humans to ready-to-use hosts and are often used as a supplementary method for antiviral treatment in the control of infectious diseases caused by emerging viruses.
The attempts to build vaccines on the basis of protein S have been made to produce strong, durable, or security protection against SARS-CoV.
Live vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the effect of these vaccines in elderly people and the hard-hearted models and their protection against common human and animal viral infections must be determined before the clinical study begins.
This is probably due to the fact that Sarah has been rooted 17 years ago and hasn't been reported any new case since then.
On the contrary, MERS’s spreads are still seen in the Middle East and, due to the existence of sources of transfer from animals to humans in native regions, spread to other regions.
Vaccination solutions for MERS are provided using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmates, virus carriers, nanozerates, semiconductors and neutrophil protein subunits, some of which are evaluated in animal models.
The production of safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for non-infective people is essential and vital to the control of the epidemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome this problem due to the long period needed to produce vaccines (as an average of 18 months) and dynamic changes of various CoV types.
COVID-19, as a new disease, has begun to show the complete clinical period among thousands of new patients.
In most cases, patients improve the effects gradually and without notice.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with the effects and death in patients with severe cases.
Consequently, creating a predecessor model of disease flow, is essential for healthcare and treatment organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limitations of facilities.
According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors can affect the prediction of COVID-19 patients' flow (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for predicting SARS flow, which is also true for COVID-19.
Covid-19 occurs mainly in the ages of 30 to 65 years of age; a study conducted on 8.866 found that 47.4% of patients over the ages of 50 were aged.
Patients who needed special care were most of the symptoms and insufficiency, and their age was more than those who did not need special care (the average of the first group was 6 and the average of the second group 51 years). This indicates that age is a predictive factor in the disease flow and coughing.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 causes most men to suffer from women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Previous diseases and effects: COVID-19 patients who need special care were more likely to suffer from heart attacks and arthritis.
Heart attacks were also the primary cause of SARS patients’ death.
SARS-CoV-2 can also be linked to ACE2-positive collagencytes and lead to liver impairment in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and background diseases are strictly connected to each other and may interfere with each other.
Unnatural laboratory findings: The level of protein C reaction in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or injury in the tissue and is suggested to be a potential factor for the disease, a response to the final treatment and healing.
The CRP level is also proposed with the intensity and prediction of the flow of COVID-19 disease.
In addition to this increase in lactates of diuretics (LDH), aminotransferaz aspartates (AST), Alanin aminotransferaz (ALT) and CK cannase can also help predict results.
These enzymes are widely displayed in several bodies, especially in their heart and liver, and are released as a result of injury to tissue.
They are as traditional signs of heart or liver disorders.
Main clinical symptoms: To predict the results and effects of COVID-19, the radiography of the breastplate and the advancement of time clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Usage of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immune system suppressors that are usually used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
Since high-dose corticoasteroïdes were widely used in SARS patients, many people suffer from chronic incapacity and decreased life quality.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used with low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Psychic stress: As explained above, many patients suffer from extraordinary stress since they are often quarantine for a long time and have been severely uncertain and have witnessed the deaths of close family members and patients in their room.
Provide mental advice and long-term support to help improve these patients and get rid of stress and return to normal life.
According to cognitive population studies that have been conducted so far, it seems to have a difference between COVID-19 epidemiological characteristics and SARS.
SARS-CoV-2, in addition to the reproduction in the lower respiratory system, can be effectively reproduced in the upper respiratory system and have at the first stage of infection, mild or misleading alloys and similar to other CoVs that cause normal cooling.
Therefore, patients with the first stage or weekly period can produce lots of viruses during daily activities that can harder control this epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transfer occurred when patients were severely ill and did not occur at the initial stage of the disease.
Therefore, the spread of COVID-19 is much more severe than the spread of SARS and its control is more difficult.
There are now lots of efforts in China, including the prohibition of exit from homes in Wuhan City and surrounding cities and quarantine constantly in the hope of the SARS-CoV-2 transfer chain.
Although these measures have been severely harmful to the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new patients has decreased, indicating the decline in the process of the disease.
The most predictable estimate is that the spread of the disease will end until March and the virus loss phase will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, some of the experts are not so good.
Paul Hunter and his colleagues estimated COVID-19, which seems basically more satisfactory than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and his colleagues founded a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and believed that SARS-CoV-2 could contaminate two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the middle-rated eye soap and cow soap of patients who had left the hospital and improved two weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus can become a cycle of flu-like disease.
Nevertheless, there have been hopeful signs in China based on a decrease in the number of new cases that suggests current strategies may be servers.
Initially, it was predicted that Ibula would cause the death of a million people and half a million people.
However, through severe quarantine and separation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 becomes weaker in terms of pregnancy and eventually eliminates or becomes a low-borne virus that lives next to humans.
The comparison of all Covid-19 measurements with SARS and MERS is shown below (formulation 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted through a swelling or softness and is possibly transmitted through direct contact with contaminated substances to the virus.
The virus has also been found in a defence that provides the possibility of transferring from defence to mouth.
A new study on 138 reported that 41% of the cases of hospital infection occurred, including 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 patients from the Treatment Center.
Therefore, it should be very careful to spend on the protection of people, especially the medical care framework, social aids, family members, co-workers and even those who are in contact with patients or people with this disease.
The first defence line that can be used to reduce the risk of contamination is to throw a mask, which can also be used by surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (serie 1860) that helps control the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask prevents the passage of liquid drops spread by potential people with air or climbing to the level of substance where they can be transferred to others.
However, only N95 masks (serie 1860) can protect individuals against inhalation of 10 to 80 nanometers and only 5% of the virusic particles can completely pass through it; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV size and both are nearly 6.5.
Since the particles can even pass out of the five surgical masks, health care boxes that are in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serie 1860) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, healthcare cabinets must wear isolation genes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect the person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a physician with a mask of N95 was infected with SARS-CoV-2; the virus may have entered his body through the eyes of his male.
Therefore, health and treatment boxes should also use transparent shelves and glasses while working with patients.
In general, people in contaminated or potentially infected areas are highly suggested to over-commonly touch their hands with anti-infectant soaps and try to stay at home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The distance of three feet (one meter) is considered a suitable distance for people who stay away from the patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and also prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, its large-scale spouses reported with SARS - CoV on January 7, 2020, based on the profound memories of the SARS spread in 2003, it had a significant warning for China.
However, until January 19, 2020, the head of the Center for Disease Control of Wohan, saying that the new virus is low and that it is limited to human transfer, and that there is no problem to prevent and prevent this disease, gave the citizens a passion for it.
This message significantly reduced awareness of the risk among the general people, particularly when the whole country was preparing for the festival and lost the vital time to prevent this disease at a minimum in Wohan.
Disease control agencies in China may learn hard about this and make fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should have a general focus on the situation (e.g., given that any word spoken by health organizations is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions, and should have more careful attention; rather than a general focus on the patient's response to the patient's response to the patient's response to the patient's response to the patient's response to the patient's response to the patient's response to the doctor's and authorities;
The spread of COVID-19 was started by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus in late December 2019.
In less than two months and the time it has been tested, the virus has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has caused SARS’s return.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that knowing them is essential to prevent this epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly people than young people and more men than women, and its intensity and death rate are also more elderly than young people.
The SARS death was higher than COVID-19 (0.11% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 even when they have no symptoms transmit the virus, while patients with SARS when they were severely ill transmit the virus, causing COVID-19 inhibition to be harder than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 has expanded more and wider than SARS-CoV.
Normal RNA testing in SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can be repaid with the virus and the result of their testing is positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues have remained unresolved as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although between the SARS-CoV-2 and the two CoV Sars are seen as a row, about 96% of genetics, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the rows.
Which animal, as a waist, transferred the virus from the main hosts, for example, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission and the spread of the disease can return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemistry have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, how does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent disease-related changes?
Is this virus connected to cells with ACE2 in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we can't get quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the spread continue?
How does the virus become genetically transformed during human transition?
Will this disease be transformed into a disease all over the world, such as a little loss or return to a periodic form such as flu?
The answer to the above questions is essential, but it may take a while to answer the above questions and many other questions.
Nevertheless, with any cost we may need, we have no choice but to stop all of this and return our lives to normal modes as soon as possible.
Human Coronavirus Animal Animals
Thousands of years ago, compatibility and adaptation have led to the development of the simultaneous coronavirus (CoV) and their hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to be the cause of mild diseases such as cold.
The emergence of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed on the coin how devastating and dangerous HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the center of China in late 2009, the CoVs remarked in the Conon and surprised us with its top end, but the symptoms of this disease were less compared to her sister SARS - CoV.
HCoV infection is a common type of disease between humans and animals and the recognition of HCoV animal origins helps us well.
Most of the HCoVs are feces that do not cause disease in their body.
Hosts that operate as a medium tank of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has a direct effect on the prevention of disease in humans.
The review of CoV host interactions in animals can also gain an important insight into human CoV disease.
In this review, we provide an overview of the knowledge available about the seven HCoV, focusing on their discovery history, as well as the animal manusha and a variety of transfers.
The important topic to which we process is the comparison of different HCoVs from the viewpoint of viral development and genetic neutralization.
All the current Coronavirus (Covid-19) disease is discussed in this field.
In addition, there is a need to change the host and the development of the virus for the severity of the disease in this article.
Coronaviridae (CoV) viruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is composed of a group of fluvial viruses, with positive polyarthritis and monodisciplinary RNA.
These viruses, which have the largest genome from 26 to 32 kilograms in between RNA viruses, are called "CoV", which is due to the morphology of the tail as they are under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have integrated genomes that have a similar structure in common.
Almost two thirds of the genome include two large coating frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are converted into polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab replicate.
The polyprotein is more complex and produces 16 non-structured proteins called nsp1 to 16.
The remaining part of the genome includes ORFs that are used for structural proteins such as spack (S), filament (E), gasha (M) and nocloproprene (N).
A number of side-proteins that are specific parents have been encoded by different CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein toilets, CoVs are classified into four gender (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), including more beta-CoV gender and are divided into four breeds (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence has shown that ants and suppliers act as a source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes while birds are the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV tanks.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly passed through species barriers and some have appeared as important factors of birth disease for humans.
To date, seven human CoV (HCoV) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 R alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoV include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, coronary respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronary respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 typically cause mild symptoms such as colds or dizziness.
On the contrary, MERS-CoV, SARS - CoV and the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are a severe disease that causes a respiratory infection in most patients, and most likely causes a severe respiratory dyspne syndrome (ARDS) and the emergence of out of the lung symptoms.
The first HCoV-229E race, called B814, was separated from frequently cold-painted patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which create their symptoms, our knowledge has increased.
In fact, this concept was widely accepted that HCoVs were generally harmless until the SARS spread.
The SARS was in 2003, which is one of the most harmful injuries at present, with over 800 people, and was about 10 percent of the raw infections.
Ten years later, the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused the spread of a disease that was all captured on the Arabian Peninsula, which had a spread across the world.
In 2019, the new HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently changed to SARS-CoV-2, was the overall Coronavirus disease control factor in 2019, which killed more than 3,122 people until March 3,20 and infected more than 90,000 people.
The alarm is at risk and the world has to prepare its own for the disease of all SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoVs has pets, including cattle, mouse, or pets.
There are many evidence that the evolutionary monasteries know all of the HCoVs from the seeds, are well adapted to these viruses and are present without signs of disease and show a lot of genetic diversity.
COVID-19 has created great medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Mansha tracking provides an animal disease, a framework for understanding the natural history, stimulating and restricting species.
This may also facilitate the search for tanks, medium hosts, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifier hosts, and have important consequences in preventing future alleviation.
In this review, we will have an examination of the Mancha animal, transmission between HCoV species and birth diseases.
In particular, we highlight this common topic and discuss where parent HCoV viruses are not normally diseased in their natural habitat, but after a species transfer to a new host, they are diseased.
We also examine the development process of HCoV, where the increase in the virus rate is often associated with the reduction of birth disease.
Consequences of SARS-CoV-2 are currently discussed in this area.
Animal CoVs were known for us in the late 1930s.
Before the initial separation of HCoV-229E B814, different CoVs were separated from normal cold-feeding patients' vision structures in various kinds of animals, including beans, mouse, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past few decades, seven HCoV have been identified.
A short summary of the HCoV discovery date (Table 1) can be a teacher and contains good information.
In 1966, the HCoV-229E toilet was samples from the respiratory system of patients with an ultraviolet respiratory infection and then adapted to growth in WI-38 cell cells.
Patients with HCoV-229E experienced normal cold symptoms, including headaches, fatigue, weakness, and headaches, and fever and headaches were observed in 10 to 20% of them.
In 1976, HCoV - OC43 separated from the organ vessels in the laboratory and gradually entered small mice brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV - OC433 have similar characteristics created by HCoV - 29E that are not detectable in the light of symptoms of other respiratory infections such as flu A and rhinovirus.
HCoV – 29 and HCoV – OC43 are both globally broadcast and transmitted mainly during the winter season in the moderate climate.
In general, the period of the two viruses is less than a week, and after that the disease takes about two weeks.
According to studies conducted on human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E suffered mild cold.
Only in several patients with immune deficiency, severe respiratory infections have been observed.
SARS disease, also known as the "Anti-Pack" disease, is the first disease in human history that is the SARS-CoV factor and is the third HCoV discovered.
The first SARS case can be traced in late 2002 in Guangzhou Province of China.
The SARS spread caused a disease of 8,966, and killed 774, and found spread in many countries and continents.
Except for the extraordinary issue, it is estimated that each of the cases may suffer from nearly two other cases, a weekly period of four to seven days and overloaded viruses appear on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients with SARS - CoV initially suffered muscle pain, headaches, fever, weakness, and laser, and afterwards breathing depression, headache, and respiratory dystress appeared as the following signs.
Lempupenia, increased liver function testing and serotonin canases, are normal SARS laboratory insufficiency.
A broad alvocal destruction, the reproduction of epithelial cells and the increase of microwaves have also been observed in Sars patients.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients were in need of special care and mechanical ventilators.
In addition to the respiratory apparatus, several organs including the cough, liver, and kidneys were infected in severe cases, which was usually accompanied by a storm of sitocine, which could be particularly deadly in patients with safety impairment.
This virus was first sampled during open lung tissue removal operations, one of the patients who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been a lot of efforts to investigate HCoV.
HCoV - NL63 was separated from a seven-month child in late 2004 from the Netherlands.
Initially it was found that this disease is common in skin disease children, elderly patients and people with common immune deficiency with respiratory diseases.
Zackam, folklore, fever, and bronchitis in the disease caused by HCoV - NL663 is common.
In another independent study, the separation of the same virus from the sample of a 8-month-old boy who suffers from anxiety in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was identified in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
It is estimated that HCoV - NL63 factors are about 4.7% of chronic respiratory diseases, and it is estimated to occur in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL363 is accompanied by inflammation of the membrane, also known as the crop.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was built in Hong Kong with the origin of bronchitis.
In addition to breast disease and bronchitis, it has been reported that HCoV - HKU1 is associated with severe asthma disease.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 virus is found all over the world and relieves respiratory diseases.
These four families transmitted through society, are well compatible with humans and are generally less prepared for severe diseases, although incidents occur for unknown reasons, for example, rarely reported recently, the type of HCoV-NL63 causes the infection of the respiratory system.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire their effective transmission and continuation ability in humans, the severity of virolence or maternal disease decreases.
MERS - CoV was separated from the lung in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient who had a severe insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the confirmed laboratory cases of the virus are coming from the Middle East, import cases with secondary release have been reported to change close contacts in different European and Tunisia countries.
The second invasion in South Korea was approved in 2015 with 186.
The clinical appearance of MERS is a similar SARS disease, which is known as a severe pre-preventive character.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also experienced a total severe insufficiency, which is amongst MERS's HCoV diseases.
More than 30% of the patients had severe symptoms such as swelling and eruption.
Until February 14,202, more than 25,000 cases have been approved in a laboratory with a high rate of 34.4 per cent, which has caused MERS - CoV to be one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to late 2009, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases were identified in the Hobbie province of China.
The World Health Organization announced the launch of the infection of the respiratory system, which was the SARS-CoV-2 replacement, as a global emergency state of public health, which called COVID-19 disease.
By March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 90,533 and the percentage of raw pollution was 3.4 per cent.
It is noted that deaths in China's Hobbie were 4.2%, while outside it were 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 such as SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV causes severe respiratory infections that are seen as fever, swelling and anxiety.
The disease is also seen in some patients.
Rain is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become a rigid respiratory dystry syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar to it because of 82% of the high level of nucleotide, they are flooded to different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 has less progenital disease than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it is more transmitted.
Some people with SARS-CoV-2 had no symptoms that this could help spread rapidly around the world.
The SARS-CoV-2 comparison with six other HCoV shows significant similarities and differences.
The first case that the weekly period and the duration of the period of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six HCoV process.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms between SARS-CoV and four HCoV transferred from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
A SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are commonly seen in HCoV infections transmitted from society, including non-specific symptoms, melamines, or even in some cases without symptoms.
On the other hand, under a small set of COVID-19 cases can also be seen with SARS - CoV infection, although it is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting patterns of HCoVs and SARS-CoV transferred from the community.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transferability is at least the size of HCoV transferred from the community.
On the other hand, it is necessary to confirm whether the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capability is reduced as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV after several times human transmission.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in defense samples.
The fact that SARS-CoV-2 transfers through defence or urine like SARS - CoV plays an important role in the Eva transfer at least under certain circumstances, should be cleared by future studies.
It is also interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2, like HCoV transferred from society, may be seasonal or not.
However, SARS-CoV-2 features include transferability, birth disease and sustainable expansion after transfer from a person to another will affect the ultimate fate of COVID-19.
Every four HCoV transmitted from society that creates mild symptoms of disease are well compatible with humans.
From the other point of view, it may be true that humans are well compatible with these four HCoVs.
In other words, both of them can be an ancient HCoV reservoir.
HCoVs that caused severe diseases in humans and humans with severe HCoV diseases have now disappeared.
For this purpose, HCoVs must be reproduced sufficiently in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive gears to dilute the host's limiting factors.
In this case, the more SARS-CoV-2 spread continues and the more people suffer from this disease, the more chances will be for the full compatibility of the virus with humans.
If the virus is well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent it from being transmitted into humans by quarantaine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four CoV accounts of society are circulating in human communities and cause common cold in people with a healthy immune system.
These viruses do not need an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are inconsistent with humans and their transmission between humans cannot be stable.
These viruses need to be preserved and released in their animal tanks and are looking for the opportunity to have ready human goals, which is possibly done through one or more medium hosts and enhancers.
SARS-CoV-2 features that are obtained from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four HCoV from the same society.
This virus, like HCoV transmitted from the community, has high transmission capacity for at least for the present time.
However, its birth disease is transmitted from HCoVs less from society and more from SARS - CoV or MERS - CoV.
You must wait to see if the virus is fully compatible with humans and if it is transferred between humans without a scam or animal host.
Before discussing HCoV's animals, it will be useful to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, warehouse, hosts and HCoV's reproductive hosts.
If an asylum animal is a near-virus crash that has a high-level nocleotide toilet, the animal acts as a HCoV evolutionary host.
The parental virus is usually well adapted to the host and is not a disease for it.
In the same way, a tank host is unstoppable and long-term refuge to HCoV.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host of HCoV or her father's viruses.
On the contrary, if HCoV has a host prior to human contamination, or nearly the same time, it is not well compatible with the new host and is often the disease.
This vast host can act as an animal tank of human infection, and in the role of a reproductive host by providing the possibility of temporary reproduction of the virus and then transferring it to human, increases the level of infection in humans.
If HCoV can't keep its transmission in a stable medium host, it can cause mortal infections.
Contrary, HCoVs can be compatible with the medium hosts and even attend the host group in the long term.
In this way, the average host acts as a natural tank host.
Epidemiology data suggests that the first person with SARS has a surgeon fishing animal.
The following surveys show that the level of immunoglobin G anti-sarus is more in animal products sellers than in normal people.
For the first time, a number of larvates (Paguma larvata) and a racon dog were detected on the live pet market with SARS-CoV semiconductor viruses that were nearly one with SARS-CoV.
A deletion profile of 29-nocleotide for SARS-CoV has been found in races taken at the beginning of the human epidemic.
At the same time, it has been reported that forest residents or farms that were not distributed on the live animal market were mainly due to the existence of SARS - CoV. This suggests that forest is probably merely hosted and repeated, not a natural SARS tank.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS - CoV, so the possibility that several species of small breasts may also be unable to act as median enhancing hosts for SARS - CoV.
All of these are apparently the final hosts of SARS - CoV.
In the next search of the natural animal host SARS - CoV, a type of coronavirus that was very close to CoV and called the coronavirus HKU3 associated with Sars (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) was found to live in China Coronavirus.
These are positive in terms of anti-SARS-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 towels.
These viruses and other CoVs have 88% to 92% of the nucleotide toilet similar to SARS-CoV.
These studies have become a background for a new theory that says the host of new viruses is human birth disease.
A number of coronavirus (SL-CoVs) were also identified in the cell, but none other than WIV1 were able to separate the virus alive.
Human enzyme converter 2 (ACE2) was identified as a SARS - CoV receptor.
WIV1, which was obtained from the ACE2 stream, ACE2 streams, ACE2 streams, and humans are used as a receptor to enter the cells.
Interestingly, my head was improved by Sarahs, having the ability to infect WIV1.
Until now, WIV1 has been the closest SARS – CoV in the world, with 95 percent of the nucleonide towel similarity.
Although there are lots of relationships between these two types of viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 virus isn't SARS - CoV and CoVs, the SARS - CoV tank hosts.
Philogenetic analysis combines MERS-CoV with a similar group like a bat CoV-HKU4 and a bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS - CoV use similar hosts called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
Polymerase RNA towels associated with MERS - CoV are more close to physiologically detected beta-CoVs from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild animals.
The MERS - CoV and its closest relatives, CoV-HKU25, have only 87% similar to the nucleotide total.
Therefore, the lock cannot be hosted by MERS - CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels are positive from the point of view of the MERS-CoV species, which also confesses the issue of camels in the Middle East that are used in the African country.
MERS-CoV live similar viruses found in humans were sampled from the vision of the camels of a mountain and showed that camels are the real MERS-CoV tank hosts.
It should be noted that symptoms have generally been observed in very mild and very severe viruses in camels that have been experimentally infected with MERS - CoV.
It is noted that contaminated camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory device but also through the respiratory - the mouth, which is also considered the main way to drive the virus in the cage.
However, one of the questions remaining unresponsive since then is that in many cases, MERS confirmed, there was no contact with camel before the appearance of symptoms, which is likely to be given to human transfer to humans or unknown transfer pathways that include unknown species of animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 96.2% total nocleotide similarity with the CoV RaTG13 virus separated from the nose.
Such as SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV, the total wave between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is very excellent to determine the parental relationship.
In other words, it cannot be the SARS-CoV-2 blasphemous container host unless the blasphemous CoVs are almost the same in the future.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2, where many of the initial cases of COVID-19 have been seen, should be sold among wild animals and killed in the Honolulu seafood market, which indicates the potential transmission of the virus from the animal to human.
Recent metagenous studies show that a group of small breastfeeders at risk known as Panouline (Manis javanica) may also be ancestral beta-CoV asylum in connection with SARS-CoV-2.
This new genetic species has about 85% to 92% similar to the nucleotide toilet to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, these viruses are associated with roughly 90% of the analogy of nocleotide toilets equally with RaTG13.
These viruses are scattered into two sub-infrastructures of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a connector domain similar to SARS-CoV-2 and has 97.4% the same acid acid Amen.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs have a greater difference, of course, with a higher degree of total similarity throughout the genome.
In a previous study conducted on the patient’s pongolins, it has been reported that fragments of the lung samples are separated from the viral DNA that are associated with SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, various methods of obtaining toilets and manual correction were used to create a portion of the genome toilet that constituted about 8.3 per cent of the length of the virus.
We can't deny that Panoughlin is one of the SARS-CoV-2 animal hosts.
However, there is currently no consciousness that SARS-CoV-2 origin exists in the pangola because there are SARS-CoV-2 toilets and beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangola vague.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2-Pangolin.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathway has not yet been acquired in caffeine, pongoline and other breastfeeders.
While most toilets have been seen in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs associated with beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genetic toilets.
It is believed that there is a high degree of similarity between the beta-CoV RBDs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2, resulting from homogeneous evolution by selective means.
Different suggestions are the supporters of the re-combination of beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wildlife species.
Neutrality as a stimulant force in evolution, is common between beta-CoVs.
The decisions on SARS-CoV-2 have not been completed.
In addition to the very diseased HCoV, Mansha animal HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 continues to be studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV - NL63 and HCoV - 29 may be associated with CoVs, while parent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV - HKU1 viruses are found in infants.
CoV is reported to have a close relationship with .ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), which is seen in the three-color North American box.
On the other hand, HCoV - 29 E is genetically linked to another CoV scaffold called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008 discovered in Gana, while the completes are also suspected as the middle host of the virus.
In order to clarify this, the knowledge available in particular of the HCoV animals known in Table 1 and Table 2 has come in a summary.
Philogenetic analysis has provided evidence for the transfer between HCoV species in history.
In 1890, when HCoV - OC43 found transferred between various animal species to infect humans through the arthritis, it numbered a respiratory infection.
The history of transfer between HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Alpha-CoVs that have a close relationship with HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them, there is an alpha-CoV alpha.
Several evidence of the direct transmission of the virus is supporting humans by swallows.
First of all, humans, not alpaca, can communicate with turkeys in a common ecological environment.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alcapes.
Secondly, alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are varied and non-biometric in the membrane, while alpha-CoVs cause breathing disease in animals.
Alpha-CoV alpacae was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is unable to remove the possibility that alpha-CoV alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Al
In fact, the viruses are a direct source of human disease viruses, including viruses, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus, viruses of the virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the curves directly transfer HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, whilst alpha-CoVs act as a HCoV-229E genetic treasure, alpaca and camels may act as a wide host that transmits the virus to humans, exactly as seen in MERS - CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent sample of transfer between a species of cattle to a mountain camel and camel to humans.
The discovery of MERS-CoV's evolutionary manecha has been known since the same initial identification of the virus and has strengthened the following findings of the theory.
Obviously, the tanks provide a rich container of virus species for the exchange between a species of genetic components and the transfer between a species.
Long lifetime, occupied colonies, close social interaction, and strong ability to fly, are all the conditions that are suitable for hitting that make it an ideal virus distributor.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been invaded for decades in the camel of a mountain.
This virus is well compatible with these camels and this camel has turned from a medium host into a fixed and natural host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and in these animals, the rate of stress is relatively low.
The transmission of the virus to humans is an accidental occurrence and humans are hosted by MERS-CoV because it cannot be sustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transfer, the role of Panoulina, of course, is different in the SARS-CoV-2 transfer.
The fact that the beta-CoV pangolin is very sick in pangolin.
These animals may be beta-CoV hosts associated with SARS-CoV-2, similar in the case of SARS - CoV.
There are several possibilities for transferring between SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans that must be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, it can be a virus host associated with SARS-CoV-2, almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may have an ecological position in common with coal through coal or coal extract.
Secondly, pangolin can be one of the amplifier medium hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans are infected with this virus through hunting and eating meat.
It is possible that many breastfeeders, including pets, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
Animals and wild animals are essential in the view of animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2's non-compatibility and compatibility may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both ponds and pangolas.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animals continues.
Apart from various types of animals hosts, three other factors on the side of the virus are important to facilitate the passage of CoVs from existing obstacles.
First of all, the rate is relatively high in their RNA multiplication.
The estimated gear rate in the CoV virus, with an average replacement rate, is equivalent to approximately 10-4 replacement rates per year to each site 2, depending on the CoV compatibility phase with the new host, compared to other single-scale RNA viruses, can be calculated to “average” to “more”.
CoVs have an erroneous exorbitoneuclease correction that can lead to very high, mortality or even deficiency of survival.
Interesting point is that Remdesivir is prevented from reproducing CoV through the inhibition of this RNA-related exoribunobonoclose and polymerates.
Remdesivir is one of the expected anti-SARS-CoV-2 factors to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the CoV turnover rate is approximately one million times more than their hosts.
In addition, the rotation rate is high when CoVs are not well compatible with the host.
Compared to SARS - CoV with a high rotation rate, the rotation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, which indicates its higher human compatibility.
Probably, the virus is now compatible with another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is the subject for MERS - CoV that authenticates the beauty of a mountain compatible with the camels.
In theory, genetic change is far from being able to speed up vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
The second is that a large RNA genome in CoVs makes it more flexible in the genetic and neurotransformation of the genome and thus increases the possibility of mutual interchange between species, which helps in appropriate conditions the emergence of new CoVs.
The subject is supported with a large amount of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the end of the 3' genome.
Thirdly, CoVs randomly and repeatedly change the forms at the time of replication of RNA through a unique "copy - selection" mechanism.
In the host that acts as a mixed tank, the radiation replacement occurs frequently during the chronic period of CoV RNA.
Subgenum RNAs and totally similar with the length, can be combined again to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoV - HKU1 and HCoV - OC433 as well as CoV animals such as bat - CoV and batCoV - HKU9, phylogenetic evidence has been found for natural neutralization.
Virus Interaction - Host in connection with transfer
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction with the host host is another key factor that affects the transmission between the species.
Here, the SARS - CoV is considered as a normal sample, which shows a positive choice during a species transfer event.
Based on a comparative analysis of human-separated samples and SARS-CoVs, it is assumed that SARS-CoV has a rapid adjustment in various hosts, particularly with rotating in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD in protein S virus CoV interacts with the cell receptor and stimulates the host's severe antibody reaction.
In SARS - CoV, it is located in amino acids from 318 to 510 and on the S1, which is connected to human ACE2 and common virus entry receptors.
RBD SARS - CoV is able to detect various ACE2 receptors of animals, including cabbage, silk, mouse, and racon dogs, which provide the possibility of cross-type transmission for the virus.
In fact, it has been observed that the only remaining 6 amino acids are different from the virus samples taken from humans and the RBDs, and four of them are in connection - the receptor to interact with the ACE2-receiver.
SARS - CoV Siot has K479N and S448T in its RBD, which can increase the desire for protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can be vital for the compatibility of the virus with humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has a cell receptor similar to SARS - CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS - CoV in the S1 protein S unit indicates that the tendency to connect S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows that there is a tendency of 10 to 20 times for this link between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another shared recipient is required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV - NL63 is also connected to ACE2 but with another part of S.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV - OC4.
These receptors may also be an explanation of the successful compatibility of these CoVs in humans after the transition between a species of animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the transfer between HCoV species is also controlled by other factors depending on the host and restrictor.
The migration of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV hosts such as cabbage, single mountain cheese and suppliers can cause an obstacle to translating between species.
For a successful interspecies transfer, HCoV must control the host-dependent factors and eliminate the host's restrictive factors.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important field of virus-host interaction should be identified and identified.
The totally impartial departure of the genome of host dependence and restrictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology can be a beneficial investor.
Finding new HCoVs: From the beginning
The diversity of CoVs has provided plenty of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this way, CoVs act as a HCoV gene tank.
In addition, rapid and genetic neutralization also leads to advancement of HCoV evolution and acts as two important stages in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing new protein encoding genes has a potential for severe change of viral phenotypes.
Among SARS - CoV side proteins, ORF8 is assumed to play an important role in human compatibility, since after the separation of the SARS - CoV-related antidepressant virus, it has been revealed that this virus encodes different ORF8 proteins.
The nucleotide-29 removal feature has been observed in separate angles at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is assumed to be an adaptive drive that helps change hosts.
In addition, SARS - CoV has a potential neurological history with Alpha and Gamma CoV ancestors, in which a lot of smaller neurological fields were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Nutritive sites were identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
It has also been shown to have experienced the MERS-CoV globalization factor, neurotic events between the various ancestors that occurred in the Arab single hills.
In addition to SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV, a neurotic event in other HCoVs has also been observed, in which HCoVs are combined with other animal CoVs in their non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can help to unwanted changes in the virus genome, which is most likely due to the release of viruses from selective pressure, such as the host immune system.
A sample of these effects is the loss of ORF4 with full length in the original HCoV-229E sample due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although ORF4 can be seen in HCoV-219.E-related viruses, the alpha-CoV alpaca with an additional no-cliotic unit leads to change.
The final point is of course not least that the development of new HCoVs is also guided by selective pressure in their tank hosts.
There were no signs or mild signs when detected that coaches were contaminated with CoVs, which indicated the compatibility between CoV and coaches.
The membranes seem to be well compatible with CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, deficiency in activating pre-inflammatory reactions in membranes effectively reduces the damage caused by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in cavities is broken because of the NKG2/CD94 re-regulation of NKG2/CD94 killer cell receptor and the low level of tissue compatibility of large-class complex molecules.
In addition, the high level of rocket oxygen species (ROS), which is due to the metabolic activity of the upper branches, can also disrupt the CoV reproduction and also affect the reverse of the effect of exoribonicolease, resulting in the selective pressure in the production of new races of a very pathogenous disease.
CoV races that are mostly diseased can lead to new protein gains or protein properties to host compatibility.
There is no chance that three new HCoVs have appeared in the past two decades.
CoVs are not a disease or cause mild flare in tank hosts such as cattle and camels.
These viruses are severely repeated without faced with strong host security responses.
Here is a secret why pregnant women are seen without signs of disease and what causes severe conditions in human abdomen.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the severe activity of the immune system and the storm of the citonic, where the stronger the reaction of the immune system will be, the severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, in pregnant women without signs of disease, the immune response is separated from the reproduction of CoV.
The separation strategy of the immune system reactions may have adverse effects on treatment with anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
The interferon responses are particularly strong in the cells.
Therefore, the management of type I interferon, at least in the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be useful.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflams is weak in the lines.
However, inhibition of NLRP3 in combination with MCC950 may be useful in covid-19 treatment.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the entire SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV event article.
While the beta-CoV coaches with SARS - CoV has 95% nocleotide coaches, there is also a beta-CoV coaches with 96% nocleotide coaches with SARS-CoV-2.
While detectives and other asylum-market animals were viruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 wasn't yet identified.
Pongolin beta-CoVs, which are very similar to SARS-CoV-2, have been found and show that pongolins may act as one of the hosts or pongolin beta-CoVs may help the gene pieces in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is still no consciousness that SARS-CoV-2 is deliberately or accidentally created by humans, of course, there are questions in this field.
CoVs have returned to the center of attention due to the recent spread of SARS-CoV-2.
CoV studies have strictly altered our understanding of the importance of animal HCoV and tanks in transferring to humans.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are scaffolds and are transferred to humans via widespread hosts.
Since the SARS - CoV infection occurs in the markets of contact between humans and insects, the close of the sea animals market and the killing of insects were able to effectively end Sars disease.
In the same way, pongolins should be removed from the marine animal market to prevent animal transfer to humans, which is the reason for discovering several cases of the pongolins' beta-CoV that have close contact with SARS-CoV-2.
However, clarification of how SARS-CoV-2 transfers from pongolin and other breastfeeders to humans still needs research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV is a long time that exists in the camels of a mountain.
These camels are considered an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, milk, meat and pepper products for local people.
These camels are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, just as it was done on the wildlife market in China to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 expansion.
In order to prevent MERS's repeated spread, a comprehensive method should be taken to produce effective MERS - CoV vaccines for camels along with other contamination control criteria.
Since we are unable to remove these viruses, new genotypes may appear and cause the disease to spread.
Varieties of common CoVs between humans and animals are circulating in animals.
In particular, CoVs are very diverse with the potential to transfer from animals to humans.
There are many possibilities that these common CoVs have grown and re-combined between humans and animals, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that have a high transferability and are intact.
Eating wild animals in some regions of China must be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary connection between humans and animals.
With the hard test that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 had for us, we need to have a better plan for preparation and response.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet for a long time.
They are in their natural tanks so that there will be a chance to get rid of.
Although rabbits have many characteristics that help spread the virus, but if people learn to get away from them, the likelihood of human contact with rabbits and other species of animals can at least be reached.
Continuous monitoring of breastfeeders is essential for better understanding of the environment of CoVs and their natural hosts and will be useful in preventing the human and spread of animals.
Consequently, the most effective way to prevent common viruses between humans and animals is to keep humans away from the ecological tanks of common natural viruses between humans and animals.
Several pieces of SARS-CoV-2 animals have not yet been found.
First, if a SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus has been transferred to Panoughlin, it would be interesting to see under what conditions the Panoughlin and Panoughlin could be in a common ecological situation.
The second is that if the seal plays a direct role in the transfer of humans, how humans contacted the seals.
Thirdly, if a third breastfeeder has acted as a real host, how he interacts with different species, including humans, coughs, and pongoline.
And ultimately, since many breastfeeders, including pets, may be ready for SARS-CoV-2, both care and experience should be done.
The species, pongoline, or any other breastfeeder, is expected to be identified by SARS-CoV-2 or its parents viruses that are almost the same in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this field will clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important consequences in preventing and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
You need to update COVID-19 diagnosis criteria for "suspected items" and "approval items"
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to diagnosis and treatment of the coronavirus in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was our experience provider and is a good reference to fighting this disease all over the world.
However, coronavirus disease in 2019 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on progressing research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this article, we provided an overview of our guidelines and provided the latest diagnosis criteria for "controversed" and "controversed" according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused the spread of the disease, which is currently officially referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19), which is also referred to as Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization introduced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Our team for the fight against SARS-CoV-2 disease, a quick guide, has published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since the release time.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge gradually increase based on progressing research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment methods are constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published between January 16 and March 3, 2020, in total, seven times in which some have changed.
Joe and his colleagues have now offered a view about our guide, which includes simple preference proposals based on their clinical experience.
Their article added a new evidence to our guide and also presented valuable references to this point around the world.
We approve them and declare our appreciation.
However, their articles should be updated according to the latest instructions for diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edit (March 3, 20), to confirm suspicious cases, one of the historical characteristics of all patients with two cases of clinical clear symptoms should be combined to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if the lack of history of all patients with clinical clear symptoms should be fulfilled:
Historical history: (i) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wohan and surrounding regions, or any other community in which COVID-19 has been reported 14 days before symptoms occurred; (i) a history of hypertension, such as a history of patients who have been diagnosed with 4 and patients who have been diagnosed with 2 and patients who have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, positive testing or testing; (ii)
Clinical Symptoms: (i) tuberculosis or respiratory disorders; (ii) characteristics taken from COVID-19; (ii) the total number of white blood cells that indicate the usual number, is an increased decreased linfocyte at the initial stage of the disease.
A confirmed diagnosis of cases should be based on suspected cases associated with one of the cases of the disease or the proof of the cold as described as follows: 1) PCR blender test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2; 2) an anon-to-gen total ratio to anon-Co4 hypertension to anon-2-several ratio to anon-Co4 hypertension to anon-2-several ratio to anon-RS; 3) IgV-positive testing.
We can see that PCR blender tests were added to the second (January 18, 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020) in the respiratory device or blood samples.
The pathogenic diagnosis was added to the fourth edit (January 27, 2020) and to the fifth (February 8, 2020), and then the cold evidence was added to the seventh edit.
These changes have been carried out based on a constant research that has been looking for an optimal nucleic acid diagnosis set for rapid diagnosis, as well as on the basis of sampling of the respiratory device includes blood sampling that has made more access to different samples and has been positively tested to specific criteria.
In addition, there are more evidence that warns us about unusual flaws and careful dealing with patients with flaws.
Therefore, the diagram of Joe and colleagues should be updated, because in this individual future that does not have clinical aliam is classified as "low risk."
The score system must also be approved in practice and with more clinical studies.
To collect, we hope that more direct evidence and evidence will be presented and we want to provide our comments from the readers.
In order to identify “subjects” and “subjects” we suggest that doctors follow and follow the latest instructions of their countries.
Our team will also regularly provide guidance to provide help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, which was the highest daily figures to date.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of daily infections due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that recorded cases were reported, including 114 active cases and 33 home rest cases.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR at an online news conference, said the number of deaths was four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over the age of 60 were between 50 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.

Mike DeWine, governor of Ohio, announced that the state has extended the quartet's domestic regulations to one.
Australian shops have reduced sales tolls for every time.
Chain stores Woolworths and Coles in Australia, on Saturdays and Sundays, reduced the limitation of toilet purchases in all country-level stores in order to two and one package for each purchase.
The ALDI store also announced on Monday the limitation of the purchase of a package.
These restrictions have been announced in the form of messages on boxes and on the Facebook page of these chain stores.
According to reports, buyers are afraid of the need for personal quarantine due to the spread of COVID-19 measures to buy and store.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths restricted the toilet handheld to deliver home to a package according to any order.
These changes continue to apply to the limits of four previous packages to any purchases announced on March 4 and 5 by Woolworths and Coles.
The Coles store said in a press release on March 8 that despite the limitations of four packages, "the presence of many stores will end within an hour" and read the amount of demand "by history", the ALDI store also described it on its Facebook page on Tuesday.
According to Woolworths’ spokesman, the sales volume experienced a "grave increase" last week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the purchase amount to two packages last week.
To reduce this deficiency, Coles has ordered larger packages to suppliers and increased delivery times to stores, Woolworths has ordered more items. ALDI items related to one of the special sales designs have been made available earlier on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Association, announced that retailers are trying to increase their assets, but local council restrictions in the field of delivery trucks have made it difficult.
He said it is expected to increase production costs because suppliers are trying to meet demand and reduce special sales.
On Tuesday, the ALDI store announced that some stores were unable to make special sales on Wednesday due to their earlier sales.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report at News.com.au that stores fill their stock every night.
He added that being arrogant of the toilet will lead to the stock of stores in terms of small numbers and when the product is finished, it will cause a lot of space to be empty in the cabinets and prevent the feeling of deficiency.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Coles and Woolworths believed that if there were lots of products in the cabinet, if there were products such as toilet towels and anti-infectants in high numbers and there were possibilities to buy them, your fear and fear would be at least possible.
The company Who Gives a Crap, a private toilet recycling manufacturer, announced on Wednesday that their existence is over.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilets, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent toilets, stressed that they operate 24/7 to respond to existing demands.
Domain.com reported one of the active real estate sites that when, due to buyers’ holidays on the long weekend of the working day, fewer benefits were held, some real estate sellers donated to the first favourite providers in Melbourne, free toilet hand.
NT News, one of Darwin’s newspapers, had a special eight-title letter to be cut and used as a toilet handheld.
According to the ABC Australia report on March 3, these stores did not tend to restrict their application and announced that they had no plans to restrict their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a lot of demand for other goods, including mask, anti-infectant, dry goods, liquid and shower soap and resin.
Outside Australia also similarly, the English Ocado online supermarket was a Sunday evening witnessing the application of the restriction of purchasing the Andres toilet to two packs of 12 roulettes.
The World Health Organization has announced COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of COVID-19, which is created by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "Pandy" refers only to the spread of a disease, not to the extent that it is dangerous, however, the WHO insisted that governments are being marketed against counter-actions:
All countries can still change this pandemic for a long time.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director of the WHO, said that countries were diagnosed, tested, treated, cured, and prepared their people.
We are deeply concerned, both about the level of warning of the disease and its intensity, and about the level of warning of the inadequate failure.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former president of the U.S. Centers for Control and Prevention of Disease, this is the "bihistoric" pandemic.
In a statement published in February by CNN, he said: “Except for flu, no other respiratory virus has been tracked, from the emergence to the ongoing global spread.
Ghebreyesus also said in a similar statement: “We have never seen a pandemic created by a coronavirus before.”
He continued, "and we had never seen the pointe before being controlled at the same time."
The new situation as a pandemic after the WHO decision in January, based on the announcement of the spread of the disease, was declared as an emergency state of public health with international concerns.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Allergies and Infectious Diseases Foundation, said about the spread of the disease, "the situation of the front line is getting worse."
Associated Press reported on Thursday that at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The pandemic of Coronavirus 20-2019 is an advanced pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) which is caused by the hardened respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
It was identified in Wuhan in December 2019 and declared an emergency state of public health on January 30, 2020 with international concerns and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Until April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and the population has resulted in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have improved.
Death and death rates in China are estimated at about 4%, while globally from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Frequent diaphragms include fever, headache, and breathing anguish.
Its effects may include the disorder and severe respiratory dystrose syndrome.
The distance from the entry of the virus to the body is usually about five days, but can vary between two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or special treatment for it.
Initial treatment is adrenal and supportive treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth during the head, taking away from other people, and monitoring and personal curtaining for people who are suspected of illness.
Authorities of different countries in the world have demonstrated a response to this virus by applying travel restrictions, Cornwall, military government, risk control at work and shutting down different locations.
This pandemic leads to severe economic-social disorders, substitution or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events and a wide resource deficit that is enhanced by nervous purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed in 193 countries or nationally or locally, which affects 99.4% of students and students worldwide.
Misinformation on the virus has been spread online and has reported incidents of foreign harassment and discrimination against Chinese people and other people who have races and appearance in Eastern and Southeast Asia, as well as other areas with widespread spread of the virus.
Due to the restriction of travel and vacation of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (Hubi Province) reported a group of incidents of unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and began research on this subject in early January 2020.
These cases were mainly linked to the wholesale market of aviation foods, which is why it is believed to have animal origin virus.
The virus that causes the spread of this disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, a virus that has been recently discovered and has a close relationship with the coronavirus, the coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV. Later, it was revealed that the first known person has an epidemic, which was associated with the disease, on December 1, 2019.
One of the first cases reported in December 2019 was that two-thirds of them had a relationship with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from South China Morning Post claimed that a case was traced on November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old man from the Hobbie province who could be the first to be the case. On February 26, China reported an increase in the number of pre-order in China. China reported an increase in the number of new pre-order in China and WHO reported a decline in the number of pre-order in China, according to the number of reports.
The number of cases can be reported significantly less than the reality, especially among people with a weaker flare.
Until February 26, a relatively small number of cases have been reported among young people aged 19 and less than just 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance estimates that approximately 60% of the UK's population must be infected in order to secure the population.
In the case, the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and their tests have been declared on the basis of official positive protocols.
By March 23, no country has been tested by more than 3% of its population and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have taken official policies based on the fact that people with only mild flaws are not tested.
A survey published on March 16 showed that by 23 January, approximately 86% of COVID-19 cases were unidentified, and these cases were unregistered, 79% of the cases were recorded.
A statistical analysis, published on March 30, estimates that the number of cases in Italy has been reported significantly over cases.
The initial estimates of the basic score (R0) for COVID-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
Research published by the U.S. Center for Prevention and Disease Control found that this number could be 5.7.
People with COVID-19 often get better.
For the category of people who do not find improvements, the distance from the start of the Alamim to death was between 6 and 41 days and the most common period was 14 days.
Until April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths were reported to COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths and deaths in people over 60 years of age, and 70% of them have been affected by background diseases including heart disease and diabetes. Official statistics of the number of deaths and deaths caused by pandemic COVID-19 are generally reported to be killed.
The real number of deaths and deaths caused by COVID-19 can be much more, as this statistic may not include people who have died without testing, for example at home, in nursing centers, etc.
A lack of information from Italy has shown that the number of unexperimental deaths during the pandemic is approximately 5-4 times more than official deaths and deaths of COVID-19.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesman said "We know that [death and death rate] is less than the real amount," including an informal report based on the 2020 reports of less impact in the year 2009. The previous reports of the year are less likely to occur and the year is less likely to occur in the United States.
The first deaths outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines and the first deaths outside of Asia on 14 February in France.
Until February 28, over tens of deaths were recorded outside of China’s original territory in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Until March 13, more than forty countries and government councils have been reported in all continents except the South Pole of Death and Death. Usually various measurements are used to measure the rate of Death and Death.
These figures vary by area and over time and affect the degree of tests, quality of the health system, the treatment options, the overwhelming time of the initial proliferation, and the general health status such as age, gender and general health status. The rate of death and death is divided by the number of deaths. The total number of deaths is detected in a timely record.
According to the University of John Hubkins, the rate of global death to April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number is different in each region.
In China, the rate of death and death is estimated from 17.3% (individuals who started their depression from 10-1 January 2020) to 0.7% (individuals who started their depression after 1 February 2020).Measurements in other cases include the rate of depression (CFR) and the rate of depression (individuals who started their depression) include the rate of depression (CFR) and the rate of depression (I) individuals.
These statistics do not have time limits and follow a particular population from the start to the file solution.
A number of students have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The medical center based on evidence at Oxford University estimates that the rate of disease infection for this pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is compatible with the results obtained from the first Covid-19 random test in Germany, as well as a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on the CFR estimate.
The WHO stresses that this is controlable.
With regard to the final period of this spread, it cannot be clearly expressed and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni, from Penn State University, said: "Infectious bacteria in case they are not controlled, usually become stable and begin to decrease when the disease comes out of hosts.
But now, providing any reasonable prediction about when this will happen is impossible.
Zhong Nanshan, the Chief Medical Advisor of the Chinese Government, argued that if all countries were helped to take the World Health Organization’s recommendations for combating the spread of the virus, “this disease could end until June.”
Adam Kucharski from the London Grammar Medical School announced on March 17 that SARS-CoV-2 "may be in circulation for one or two years."
According to the research conducted by Neil Ferguson at the Royal College, physical distances and other actions "until a vaccine is constructed (probably 18 months or more) will be necessary."
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said "I think the probability of the coronavirus disappearing completely is low - because it is easily transferable" and "may become a seasonal disease that returns every year."
The intensity of this return to the immunity of the population and the intensity of it will depend.
Covid-19 can be relatively inappropriate and people with disease can be without disease.
Two of the most common flavors are fever (88%) and drought (68%).
Symptoms that have less diarrhoea are fatigue, chest mixture, loss of sensation of smell, respiratory stress, muscle and joint pain, head pain, ladder, eruption, elevation of blood, diarrhoea, and cyanosis. The World Health Organization has announced that it is about every problem.
The Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has published the U.S. Emergency Disease List: respiratory problems, constant feeling of pain or pressure in the chest, sudden anxiety, problems in awakening, swelling of the face and lips can occur, more progression, even in the event of this disease. Disease is recommended to be treated immediately.
Some people may have a lack of disease, have no clinical flaws, but the result of the test confirms their injury to the disease, so researchers have recommended that people who have been closely connected with people with the disease should be carefully monitored and tested to avoid their contamination.
China’s estimates have changed the rate of people who are missing the default from very low to 44%.
The usual weekly period (the time between the individual and the emergence of the globe) varies from one to 14 days; in the most common mode, this period is five days. As a sample of uncertainty, statistics of some people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell were initially 30% but later decreased to 15%.
Some details of how this disease is spreading are still being identified.
It is assumed that this disease is mainly transmitted through close contact and by means of small particles produced by the effect of swelling, softening or speech; and close communication means a distance between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has shown that coating without cover can spread small particles between 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some research have suggested that this virus can be produced by small particles that are spoken and also transmitted in the air for longer periods. Although this virus is not generally airborne, the respiratory rice particles can be produced by breathing, including speech.
These rice particles can come into the mouth or sight of neighbors or be moved to their lungs through breathing.
Some medical actions such as respiratory tubes and respiratory heart rates (CPR) can lead to respiratory spraying in the air, resulting in the spread of the disease.
This disease also affects an individual’s infected level, including the skin, and then moves to his eyes, eyes, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of the transmission of the disease through the membrane, it is assumed that this risk is low.
The Chinese government has rejected the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 fatty tissue transfer.Although there is also a possibility of the transmission of the disease prior to the emergence of the disease and subsequent stages of the disease, the highest level of the virus is in the first three days of the emergence of the disease.
People who have been the result of their testing for this disease up to three days before the emergence of dialyst, show that the transmission of the disease before the dialyst is significantly possible.
There are few reports of lack of flare confirmed by the laboratory, but no flare transfers have been identified by some countries during communication tracking research.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) has announced that although the rapid spread of this disease is not completely clear, a person who has two or three other diseases can usually get infected. The virus survives at different levels, from hours to days.
In particular, it has been revealed that the virus remains alive up to three days on plastic levels (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, up to one day on the seat and up to four hours on the cheese.
However, this can change depending on humidity and temperature. Until now, the results of positive testing for pets and other pets have occurred for COVID-19.
There is no consciousness that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend that people contact their hands after contacting animals, as well as having other levels of contact with infected people.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first detected by three people who were in contact with a group of people with a severe respiratory disease in Wohan.
All new features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in coronavirus related viruses in nature. Outside the human body, this virus is killed by a domestic soap that removes its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 has a primary close relationship with SARS-CoV.
It is believed that this virus has an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically-specific betacrona virus, a subdivision of the sarico-virus (generation B) along with two genes associated with decay.
This virus corresponds to 96 degrees at overall genotype level with other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid in certain areas of their genome toilets between Pongolin viruses and humans.
To date, the full genome comparison has been found that up to 92% of the genetic material between the coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 is common, which is not enough to prove that the pangolans are hosted.
Antivirus contamination can be temporarily detected through a diaphragm, however, the final confirmation is carried out through a chain reaction of rRT-PCR (rRT-PCR) infected formats or CT imaging.
The study that compares PCR to CT in Wohan suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, while less special because many CT imagery features have other pneumonia diseases and composite disease processes.
Since March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as an initial test or a test to detect COVID-19."
The World Health Organization has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first published on January 17.
This test uses a momental chain reaction of rRT-PCR (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on respiratory and blood samples.
The results of this test are usually determined between a few hours to a few days.
This test is usually carried out with a nazofrenx soap, however, soap can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
Until April 6, 2020, none of these methods were accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S., a serological test that was invented by Cellex for emergency use was only approved by some certified laboratories.
The characteristics of imaging in the radio and computer tomatoography (CT) of people who have a glare include incomparable and non-proximity glazed glazed representations.
The Italian Association of Radiology is gathering an international online database from the findings of confirmed cases of diseased photography.
Photography without PCR approval, due to bleeding with other adenovirus infections, is not specifically used for COVID-19 identification.
A large research in China compared the CT's findings with PCR and showed that although less imaging is specially useful for diagnosing this disease, it is faster and more sensitive and suggested it to be used as a relief tool in the fields with all-have.
Artificial intelligence-based neurological networks have been developed to detect the imagery features of the virus by both radio and CT.
Some methods to prevent the transmission of this disease include proper personal health compliance, hands washing, close to the eyes, eyes or mouth sitting with hands, and taking hands during headaches or moisture, and putting hands directly in the palm of the tears.
Those who have previously suffered from this disease are advised to surgical masks in public environments.
It is also recommended to comply with measures relating to physical distances to prevent the transmission of this disease. Many governments do not prohibit, prohibit or recommend non-necessary travel to countries or regions where this disease is common.
However, this virus has reached the stage of spreading at the level of society in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the communities and some people don't know where or how they are infected. People who provide health care for potential patients are advised to take more precautions to keep up with standard precautions, to take more precautions to keep up with contact.
The use of mobile phone location information by governments for this purpose has caused concerns in the field of privacy, and the International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to restrict this type of supervision.
Different mobile apps are designed or proposed to be used voluntarily by 7 April 2020, and more than dozens of experts are trying to find solutions that are not a privacy violation, such as using Bluetooth to close up the user’s number to other mobile phones.
Then, if users are closely contacted with a COVID-19 person, they receive a message.Fake notions of how to prevent this disease are spreading; for example, eye-washing or mouth-washing are not effective ways.
Although many organizations are trying to build vaccines, there is still no vaccine for COVID-19.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash your hands.
CDC recommends that people frequently wash their hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilets or cases where hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after emptying their eyes, swelling or softness.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body with domestic soap, which eliminates its protective soap.
CDC also recommends using alcohol-based anti-infectants with a minimum of 60% alcohol volume in cases where water and soap are not easily available.
The World Health Organization recommends people to touch their eyes, eyes, and mouths with sitting hands.
Liquidation of levels is possible to various methods (a minute exposure to the anti-infectant for stainless steel level), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hyperchlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betadine.
Other methods including benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate have less effectiveness.
CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or approved case of COVID in a building such as office or daily care centre, all sections such as offices, health services, common areas, common electronic devices such as tablets, touch plates, keyboards, remote controls and handhelds should be used.
Health organizations have advised people to wash their mouths or visions with their ants or hands and immediately remove their hands.
For people who are likely to be infected, surgical masks are recommended because wearing a mask can reduce the volume and distance of the breeds that are dispersed during speaking, softening or dizziness.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on time and how to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a Lids University virusologist, "wearing a mask can reduce the desire for people to touch their face that is one of the important sources of disease in case they do not respect proper health."
The World Health Organization recommends mask wearing by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of COVID-19 people, however, they also confirm that mask wearing helps people lose their own way.
Several countries have started to encourage people to wear masks.
In the United States, CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of one-time medical masks by healthy people of the community, especially when they have close contact with other people (1 meters (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended that a surgical mask be used when using public transport or stop in occupied places.
Thailand’s health authorities encourage people to make a mask at home and make them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from leaving and attending the community without wearing mask or wearing mouth and vision.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all people to make a mask when they went to public places, in order to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has forced the mask for those visiting food stores.
Israel urged all its inhabitants to join the mask when they attended the meeting.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks every day since mid-March, has masked passengers between the city trains and buses from 1 April.
Panama has forced the mask to wear while leaving and has recommended that those who can’t buy the mask make their own home mask.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes contamination control measures that are carried out in order to reduce the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
These practices include Quartena; travel limitations; school holidays and workplaces, studios, theatres and shopping centers.
People who stay at home, restrict travel, take care of their presence in occupied areas, greetings, and requests without physical contact and distance from others can carry out these practices.
Currently, many governments in areas where this disease has spread, have forced or recommended social distancing.
The maximum number of people recommended by the U.S. government and health organizations decreased from 250 people (in the event that there was no spread of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the global gathering of more than two people. Elderly people and those with background diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood pressure, and immune system deficiency are more likely to be used as well as the global deficiency of 2020, the global deficiency and severe deficiency of society, and the CDC has recommended that the patients in regions
Using the word "social distance" instead of encouraging people to maintain communications using alternative methods, it had the concept of indicating that people should enter full social isolation. Some officials issued instructions on sexual health, to use during this pandemic.
These instructions include recommendations on having sex with the only person you live with, a person who is not infected with or has a virus.
For people with COVID-19 diagnosis and suspects of contamination, personal swelling is recommended at home.
Health organizations have set out detailed instructions for correct personal quarantaine. Many governments have compelled, or recommended personal quarantaine for all people who live in areas affected by the virus.
The most severe personal quartz instructions are issued for those who are in danger groups.
Those who may have been in contact with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region that has been widespread this disease are recommended to comply with the personal quartet for 14 days since the last contact.
Strategy to control the spread of a disease are obstruction, impairment and reduction.
Inhibition is carried out in the early stages of spread, with the aim of tracking and separating patients, as well as introducing other measures to control the disease and vaccination to stop spreading the disease to the rest of the population.
When preventing the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are transferred to the reduction strategy: actions are taken to reduce the rate of spread and reduce its impact on the health and society system.
A combination of prevention and reduction measures can be implemented simultaneously.
It requires more severe measures to inhibit the pandem with a decrease in the number of the baseline to less than 1.Assured to manage the spread of an infectious disease, it is an attempt to reduce all-measurement that is known as all-measurement curve smoothing.
This reduces the risk of getting too much pressure on health services and provides more time for the production and development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can help manage the spread of this disease are personal prevention measures including hand-respecting, mask-wearing, personal curtaining; social interventions with the aim of extending them to social distances; physical interventions, including school breakthroughs, and cancellation of events involving people.
Other countries have also implemented a set of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea carried out a group and local quarantine and issued alerts in the field of displacement of patients.
Singapore considers financial support for the invasive people who are quarting themselves and imposes serious penalties for those who do not do so.
Taiwan has increased mask production and put punishment on medical supplies. Simulations made for the UK and the United States indicate that the reduction strategy (concentrating the expansion and not stopping it) and cracking (discovering the growth) are faced with major challenges.
Optimal reduction policies can reduce health demand to 2/3 and half, but still leads to hundreds of thousands of people's deaths and leads to excessive pressure into the health system.
Cough may be a better strategy, but as long as the virus is in circulation in the human population (or as long as the vaccine is prepared, if this happens earlier), it must be maintained, as the amount of action is quickly returned to the previous amount.
Long-term intervention to overcome this pandemic will cause social and economic expenses.
There are no confirmed anti-virus drugs for COVID-19, of course, attempts to make it, including existing drugs testing.
Using drugs without the need for a version of cooling, drinking fluids and rest can help reduce flare.
Depending on the intensity, it may require treatment oxygen, fluid urinary injections and respiratory aid devices.
Using steroids can make conditions worse.
Several of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being examined to be used if useful for COVID-19 treatment.
The World Health Organization has also announced the “traditional and domestic medication” that can help relieve SARS-CoV-19 disease.
The World Health Organization has described one of the key steps to tackle the spread of this disease, increasing the capacity and adapting the health system to the needs of COVID-19 patients.
ECDC and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for primary hospitals and healthcare services for the transfer of resources to different levels, including focusing on COVID-19 testing laboratory services, boosting the prevention of emergency surgical operations and suppression of emergency surgical operations, separating and isolating COVID-19 patients if possible.
There are different opinions about the origin of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first case of the new coronavirus may return on December 1, 2019 in Wohan, Hobi, China.

This amount of demand has led to an increase in prices to twenty-three normal prices and has delayed the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
There is also a lack of personal protection equipment around the world and the World Health Organization has warned that this will endanger healthcare workers.
In Australia, this pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity caused dry milk shortages in some supermarkets and was prohibited by the Australian government. Despite the high spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and its high demand for food, both regions have been abandoned of severe food shortages.
Actions taken by China and Italy have succeeded in combating the use and sale of unlawful basic products and have prevented severe food shortages predicted in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a significant deficit in the face of agricultural products, but, according to the spokespersons of industry, prices may rise.
Even in Wuhan City, it was only observed that food cabinets were empty and that Chinese government officials put pig meat stores on the market to ensure that people are feeding properly.
There are similar rules in Italy that require food producers to have storage for such emergency situations.
China’s global economy has been damaged: According to media reports on March 16, China’s economy in the early two months of 2020, due to the government’s actions to reduce the spread of the virus and significantly reduce retail to 20.5%, a very severe hit.
Since the mainland of China is one of the main production economies in the world, the spread of this virus is considered an instability threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais has predicted from the Economist Information Unit that markets will remain unstable until a clearer picture of the potential consequences of the current situation is not specified.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic adverse effects of this epidemic on global growth could be more than the effects of sarcasm in 2004-2002.
The estimate of one of Washington University experts at St. Louis shows a negative impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that can take up to two years.
According to reports, the oil exporting countries’ organization (OPC) after a severe decline in oil prices due to the decline in demand by China, it is becoming "continuous."
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside China’s mainland.
On February 27, due to increased concerns about coronavirus spread, various U.S. stock exchange indicators including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the industrial average Dow Jones experienced their most severe fall since 2008, which was the Dow index down to 1191 units, which was the largest economy falling in a single day.
Every three indicators ended the week with more than 10% reduction.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the highest rating of China but maintained its negative views.
The stock markets fell again due to fear of the coronavirus and the most fell on March 16.
Many of them know the economic decline.
Mohamed El-Erian, an economic expert, praised the urgent and timely action of central banks and governments.
Central banks, compared to the 2008 financial crisis, are responding faster.
Due to the prohibition of travel, public place holidays, including travel attractions and governments’ recommendation of self-esteem from any travel around the world, tourism is one of the most injured areas.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, have cancelled their flights due to a reduction in demand and the Flybe regional airline in the UK was shut down.
The negative effects of the virus on the cruise vessel industry have been unprecedented.
Several train stations and ship ports were also closed.
This was a disaster with Chunyun, one of the main seasons of travel and associated with Chinese New Year's holidays.
A number of events, including New Year's Festivals, in which a lot of people attended, were cancelled by national or regional governments, and private companies including Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai also independently shut down their tourist stores and attractions.
Many events and tourist attractions of the New Year, including the banished city in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions, were closed to prevent the invasion of people.
In 24 cases of 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, officials extended the New Year’s holidays to 10 February and mostly ordered workplaces not to re-enter that date.
These regions represented 80% of domestic non-profit production and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased the level of counter-infectious disease to the highest level and announced the emergency situation, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year’s holidays. Reducing hours of shops or temporary holidays caused retail damage across the world.
The visit to retail stores in Europe and Latin America decreased to 40%.
The retail stores in the North and Middle East saw a decline of 60-50%.
The spread of the disease also led to a decrease of 43-33% in traffic walking to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Large shopping centers have taken other measures around the world, including health enhancement, installing thermal scanners to check the body temperature of buyers and canceling events. According to the estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, they don't create a decline by this pandemic, which could be between 14 to 22 million people in U.S.
In January and February 2020, during the storm of this pandemic in Wohan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank for St. Louis, the spread of the coronavirus can be damaged to 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can increase to 32%. The holidays in India resulted in an unemployment rate of 44% and an unemployment rate of 10 million Indian immigrants.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers have offered temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million English workers have requested a comprehensive credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to short-term work plans with government aids known as Kurzarbeit.
The short-term compensation plan was also implemented by France and the UK.
The arts and cultural heritage departments have also been deeply injured by this pandemic, both operations and human forces of the relevant organizations – both jobs and independent – in the world.
Active organizations in the field of culture and art have endeavored to carry out their mission (which is often provided by the government budget) in the field of providing community access to cultural heritage, maintaining the safety of their employees and supporting artists as possible.
Until March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions around the world were closed for an anonymous period of time, and their exhibitions, events and exhibitions were cancelled or replaced.
Instead, a lot of efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. One of the other consequencies of this disease that has recently accelerated, the cancellation of religious ceremonies, important sports events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, concerts,
The film industry has also experienced problems. Wathan announced the cancellation of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the week and the Christianity’s repentance.
Many bishops have advised the elderly Christians to stay at home instead of attending the sunshine on Sunday dinner; some churches have made the church service available via radio, live broadcasting online or television, and some have provided the possibility of attending the sunshine on the car.
The Roman Catholic bishop has closed his churches, his churches and his monuments, and St. Peter’s field has been empty from Christian visitors, other religious institutions have also cancelled their service and restricted public assembly in churches, mosques, churches, temples and circles.
Iran’s health ministry on Friday announced that the prayer was cancelled in the areas affected by the spread of the disease, and the harms were also shut down later, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entrance of foreign visitors and its inhabitants to the sanctuary in Munich and Minneapolis.
This pandemic has led to the biggest disturbance in sports calendars around the world since World War II.
Most important sports events, including the European Cup League 20-2019, the Top League 20-2019, the Euro 2020, the NBA season 20-2019 and the NHL season 20-2019, or have been cancelled or replaced.
The spread of the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was to be started in late July, issued difficulties; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will "replane for the history beyond 2020, maximum for the summer of 2021".
This has caused many gamblers to bring online sites, many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their registration rate. The entertainment industry has also been damaged and many music groups have suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many of the major theatres including Broadway have also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing artistic works through the Internet as a replacement for traditional live performances, including live broadcast concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to be able to perform, distribute and advertise their works.
In the online space, many Internet memes have been broadcast with coronavirus articles so that many of them are dealing with tons and different issues amongst uncertainties.
Since the spread of COVID-19, there has been an increase in discrimination, foreign harassment and racism in relation to Chinese and Eastern Asian people, as well as people who are in the disease conquests in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been incidents of fear, suspicion and contempt.
Reports from February (the time most cases were still limited to China) showing racial emotions in various groups around the world about the fact that Chinese people are punishing the virus or experiencing direct punishment.
Some countries in Africa also experienced an increase in anti-China emotions.
Many of the Wohan and Hobi residents have reported discrimination on their own regional streets.
Support from Chinese people, both online and offline, has been made from those in areas affected by the virus.
After the spread of the disease to other countries, Italy's people, the first European country to experience the serious spread of COVID-19, were also exposed to suspicion and foreigners. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, attempted to stop the spread of the disease, initially signing the letters for the pandemic.
In Japan, ChineseDontComeToJapan # has been posted on Twitter.
China's followers, as well as other Asians in the UK and the United States, reported an increase in racial idolatry and attacks against themselves.
The US President Donald Trump criticized the name of the coronavirus called the "Chinese Virus", the word was criticized by racist and anti-Chinese critics.
Protestants in Ukraine attacked the buses that were carrying Ukraine's followers and foreigners who were displaced from Wuhan and were being transferred to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students who were Northeastern India who had a common border with China and were studying in primary cities of India experienced injuries and injuries related to the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, head of the Bharatiya Janata party's state department in West Bangla said Chinese have destroyed nature and "for this reason God has taken revenge from them."
The statements were later convicted by the Chinese consulate in the club and called "wrong" in China, which fired foreign, harass, and racist against non-Chinese residents, and foreigners were called "external occupation" and aimed to "build".
Many newspapers with money sharing removed the sharing costs for all or part of the coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have freely provided scientific articles related to the spread of the disease.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on servers of pre-release versions such as BioRxiv.

The test for 2019 (Covid-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 respiratory disease include ways to detect the presence of the virus and pathogens produced in response to this infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR that detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is special and only detects SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
This test is used to confirm very new or active infections.
The diagnosis of pathogens (surrology) is also useful for diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
The study shows how many people have suffered from this disease, taking into account those who have suffered very poor diseases and who have not reported or who have not suffered from diseases in general.
Using the results of this test, the precise rate of death and disease and the level of mass immunity in the population can be detected.
Due to limited trials, by March 2020, no country has reliable data on the extent of the spread of this disease in its population.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population and there are many differences in the number of tests carried out between countries.
This difference will likely be affected by the significant rate of death and death reported, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
This test that uses the momentum reaction of a chain of rRT-PCR (rRT-PCR) can be carried out on breathing samples that have been taken into various ways, including nasovarrenx soap or samples.
The results of this test are usually determined between a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test that is performed with glucose soap only provides reliable results in the first week of the disease.
After that, the virus can disappear from the glucose, while the lungs are reproducing.
For infected people who are tested in the second week, alternative samples can be taken by catheter sanctions from the respiratory depth, or the possibility of using the substances derived from scratching (mixing).
One of the first PCR test samples in January 2020 in Charité, Berlin, was invented using the rRT-PCR (rRT-PCR) rational chain reaction, and was based on the 250,000 test sets distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also invented a testing method until January 23, 2020.The Kogenebiotech company from South Korea on January 28, 2020, invented a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 clinical diagnosis kit (PowerChek coronavirus).
This kit is searching for the general gene "E" in all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene which is competent for SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies that confirmed the new emergency use of Resource 2019 Resource 2019 Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resource Resources Resource Resource Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Re.
One of the three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kit was due to deficiency identification and limitation of tests at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in a successful process during the entire February, on average less than 100 samples per day.
Until February 28, 2020, the test was not detected using two components, and then state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drugs Agency, under Emergency Use License. The U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
Since March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced that COVID-19 tests are available across the country.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 tests available across the country since 9 March 2020.
No limitations for the number of tests have been declared; sampling and processing must be carried out on the basis of CDC requirements.
In Russia, the production and development of the COVID-19 test kit was carried out by the VECTOR National Center for Virusology and Biotechnology Research.
On February 11, 2020, this test was registered by the Federal Health and Treatment Monitoring Center. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported to test for COVID-19 disease. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics confirmed that 24 hours of FDA confirmed this test, which could be tested within 3.5 hours of high volume, received a test.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use license (USA) for the m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA had previously issued similar licenses for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the USA license for a 45-minute test from the FDA.
The FDA has confirmed a test that uses PCR instead of reinforcement of isothermal nucleic acid.
Since this does not require a corresponding temperature cycle series, this method can provide the positive result in only five minutes and the negative result in 13 minutes.
Approximately 18,000 cases of these devices are currently available in the United States and Abbott expects to deliver 50,000 tests per day with increased production. A test that provides monoclonal pattan, particularly connected to the protein of the nucleopeptide, is capable of developing a precise period of time of the 20-prothetic (protein N) of the new corona virus, such as a test in the process.
The survey conducted in March 2020 concluded that "radio images of the breastplate have little diagnostic value in the initial stages, while CT findings [computer tomatography] can be identified even before the emergence of flashes."
The common characteristics of CT are multi-polar mat-glass culturing with side-distribution, non-comparative and retrospective.
With the advancement of the disease, underground overcoming, weak coverage and severity occurs.
The study that compares PCR with CT in the current pandemic principle suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and is less dedicated, while having many CT imaging features with other inflammatory diseases and composite disease processes.
Since March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as an initial test or test for COVID-19 diagnosis."
The immune system is part of the response to this infection, producing pathogens including IgM and IgG.
These tests can be used to detect infections in people after 7 days or more of the occurrence of the disease, immunity and population monitoring. This test can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through patient ballin test (PoCT).
High-capacity automatic systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but at their disposal will depend on the level of production of each system.
For CLT, a sample of environmental blood is typically used, although there is a possibility of using several samples to track the immune system response.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually taken through skin holes.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for extraction before testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA issued a list of 29 institutions that were informed of the organization as requested and were now able to distribute their own tests.
Since April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency license. At the end of March 2020, the Euroimmun and Epitope Diagnostics Medical Diagnostics Laboratory obtained European approval for their test kits. These kits could have been identified with IgG and IgA tests, which were vaccinated and vaccinated against the virus.
The test capacity is a few hundred samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the PCR decree test for the detection of the virus RNA.
These patches are usually detectable 14 days after the start of the disease. In early April, Britain found that none of the patches test sets that they purchased are not adequate enough.
Hong Kong implemented a plan that, according to it, the suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency will give a sampling tube to the patient," the patient's swelling of the mouth drops it in, also defers it, and the patient's swelling of the patient receives the result of the swelling of the patient's swelling, and the UK's swelling of the patient's swelling.
Automotive testing centers have enabled South Korea to operate one of the fastest and most widespread testing methods compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Health Insurance Association announced on 2 March that the capacity of 12,000 tests per day is planet-formed and has been tested last week from 10,700 people.
If the test order is given by a doctor, its costs are paid by health insurance.
According to Robert Kohk, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, the possibility of testing cars has been provided in several major cities.
Until March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was not specified as only positive results were reported.
A laboratory survey showed that the test was carried out by the 12/2020 calendar week, at least 483,295 samples were tested at the end of the 12/2020 week, and 33,491 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 tests (6.9%).The test was carried out in Israel, the test was carried out by the 2000 tests, the test was carried out by the 2000 tests, the test was carried out by the 64 patients.
The construction of the laboratory took 5 days and supervised its construction by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, models showed that if the test capacity did not benefit, the number of cases in Wohan was 47% more and the cost of quarantine was doubled.
Samples of the Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately launched in Shenzhen, Taiwan, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total in 12 cities across China.
Until March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity reached 500,000 tests. Open text and mixed designs published by urgenic tests, can test 1,122 patient samples only using 93 COVID-19 test kits. These are balanced designs in small laboratories and without needing to test liquid robotics.
Until March, deficiencies and no-identified substances had become an obstacle to the testing of infusions in Europe, the UK and the United States.
This led some writers to examine sample preparation protocols that included the heating of samples for up to 98 degrees centigrades (208 degrees fernate) for 5 minutes, to release the genome RIN for more testing. On March 31, it was announced that the number of tests would be greater than the number of the United Arab Emirates, now the number of other populations of the country for the testing of the virus.
This is due to the ability to test with a car and buy a large laboratory at the scale of the country's total population of group 42 and BGI (based on emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
This laboratory, built for 14 days, is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory with this scale that operates outside China.
The various testing practices ordered to target various sections of the genetic specification of the coronavirus were produced in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has used German guidelines to prepare and send a kit to low-income countries that do not have resources to produce domestic kits.
The German Test Kits Guidelines were published on 17 January 2020. Since the protocol was not available by U.S. Disease Control Centers until 28 January, it was due to delays in the start of tests in the United States, which were appropriate to respond to the United States, the problem of the United States. China and the United States were not able to respond to the level of reliability of tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive testing available in South Korea has helped reduce the new coronavirus release.
The ability to test, mainly in private sector laboratories, has been built by the South Korean government over a few years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for enhancing testing programs as the best way to slow down progress on COVID-19 pandemic. A high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the U.S. to replace the presence of soaps and chemical identifications.
In March 2020, China reported the problems in terms of precision of its test kits.
In the United States, test kits produced by CDC had "deficiency". The government then took bureaucratic barriers to carrying out private tests. Spain purchased test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the test results were not correct.
The company explained that incorrect results may result in a problem in sampling or misuse of kits.
The Spanish Minister announced that he would not use the missing results and replace them with a different test kit produced by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the Czech Republic’s test kit purchased from China gained the wrong results.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed that these kits be scattered inside the Danube River. Ateş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had "high misleading rate" and made them "not used the product" that the UK state announced that it was not used in 2020. 3.5 million test kits could be purchased in China but could be purchased in China.
The test and follow-up to quarantine people who were positive in their testing and tracking people who were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positive in their testing result.
Researchers working in Vò, Italy, where the first COVID-19 death occurred in Italy, conducted two long-term tests at a distance of ten days on the total population of about 3,400 people.
Approximately half of the people who had a positive test had no signs, and all the positive cases were quarantine.
By limiting travel to public centers, new infections have completely disappeared.
With serious tracking of people who contacted, the limitations, testing and entry of passengers, the 2020 pandemic of the coronavirus was much slower in Singapore than other developed countries, of course without severe restrictions such as the compulsory holidays of restaurants and retail centers.
Many of the events were cancelled and Singapore recommended that residents stay at home on March 28, but schools were restored after the holidays, on March 23 and in their scheduled time.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, also managed this pandemic with serious tracking of people who contacted, limits, tests and quarantines of entry passengers, with fewer holidays, of course.
A statistical study has shown that countries that have conducted more tests, have much lower rates of death and death, probably because these countries are better able to detect those who only have mild or have no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries with no test capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in the field of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten first negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 World Health Organization reference laboratories to be confirmed.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 cases in Asia, 5 cases in Europe, 2 cases in Africa, 1 cases in North America and 1 cases in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "%positive" compared to the total tests" is influenced by each country's test policy.
If all the other situations are similar, “%positive compared to all the tests” in a country where only hospitals are tested by individuals compared to a country where all citizens are tested by symptoms or not.
Hand wash, which is also known as hand health, is the process of cleaning a person to eliminate soil, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
Handwashing with soap continuously prevents the spread of many diseases during the day, for example, with the swallowing and with which they are transmitted through the defence-feed.
For example, if people do not touch their hands before touching their eyes, eyes or mouth (i.e. swelling), they may suffer from respiratory diseases such as flu or cold.
Five important positions during the day when washing your hands with soap are: before and after you go to the shower, after cleaning your child or substituting your teeth, before feeding your child, before eating, and before and after cooking your hands with meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with cocktail. The World Health Organization recommends the following:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the patient’s care.
After replacement or cleaning the child after using the toilet.
After finishing, stirring or softening.
After touching animals, curiosity of animals or feeding animals.
Health without medical attention, refers to health measures related to medical approaches.
Handwashing before taking medicine or medical care may prevent or minimize the transmission of the disease.
The primary goal of the washing of hands is to clean up the disease factors (bacteria, viruses or other disease-producing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause a risk or disease.
This is particularly important for people who work with food or work in medical-related jobs, of course, it is important for the public too.
Hand wash has many health benefits, including minimizing flu, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious factors; reduction of respiratory infections;
and lower the rate of death and death of infants during pregnancy at home.
A 2013 study found that improvements in hands-washing practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the rate of death and death resulting from respiratory diseases and children's pathologies with the promotion of simple behaviour changes such as hand wash with soap, can decrease.
This simple action can reduce the rate of death and death resulting from these diseases by almost 50%.
Actions that promote washing can reduce the damage to about a third, comparable to clean water supply in low-income areas.
48 per cent reduction in swallowing can be associated with hand wash of soap. Hand wash of soap as automated behaviour in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only, most effective and cheapest way to prevent swallowing and severe respiratory infections (ARI).
One of the most important respiratory infections is one of the causes of death and death of children under the age of 5 that causes approximately 1.8 million children to die each year.
The death of nearly 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet into a solid habit can save more people's lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, bring about half deaths and reduce one-fourth deaths caused by infections.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other health interventions as part of water, health and cleaning programs (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against yellow wound infection that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the harmful, but small effects of hand wash is that repeated hand wash can lead to drying the skin and result in damage to the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that washing hands can lead to skin burning, including as an exacerbation or hand pain, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Excessive and recurring wash is also known as one of the OCDs.
Five important times during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the transplant of the disease: after going to the shower, after cleaning your child, before feeding your child, before eating and before and after cooking, before cooking or after cooking.
Other things that should be done in the correct way to prevent the transmission of the disease are before and after treatment of injuries or wounds, after fatigue, swelling or finishing; after touching the curiosity of animals or touching the animals; and after contacting the liver.
In many countries, hand wash rates are very low with soap.
In 2015, a study on hand wash in 54 countries showed that an average rate of 38.7 percent of households wash with soap has become used. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has increased the highest rate of hand wash with soap to 97 percent. The average rate of hand wash with soap is 77 percent. The United States has a average rate of 77 percent and China is a 23 percent.
The basic health care program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is a sample of broad measures to improve health and education in children.
Two times a year with a daily washing of hands with soap, teeth wash daily with fluoride, is the main axis of the national program.
This program has also been successfully launched in Indonesia.
Adding soap or additives to water is effective to eliminate microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and ingredients is to reduce solvency barriers and increase solvency.
Water alone is an unnatural cleaner for the skin because fats and proteins that are part of organic soil are not easily dissolved in water.
However, the flow of enough water helps to clean up.
Hard soap, due to the nature of reuseability, may hold bacteria from previous banks in itself.
A small number of studies that have been conducted in the transmission of bacteria from contaminated soaps have found that the transmission of bacteria appears to be far from that because bacteria are washed with pockets.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is still convinced that “liquid soap is better accessible without direct contact.”
Antibacterial soaps are highly advertised for people who care about health.
To date, there is no evidence based on the effectiveness of anti-infectants or fertilizers in eliminating anti-biotic resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain traded antibacterial substances such as trillusane, which are resistant to a wide variety of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant species are not eliminated with antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as advertised on the market.
Advanced formulations as well as surfactant and skin protective, may contain acid (estic acid, scorbic acid, lactic acid) as an pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and antimicrobial anti-acid acid and anti-acid acid anti-acid acid and anti-acid acid anti-acid acid and anti-acid acid anti-acid acid.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, hot water combined with soap is more effective compared to cold water combined with soap in eliminating natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
Nevertheless, unlike the general imagination, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water does not affect microbial load on the hands.
The anti-infectant is a hand-made non-blue health substance.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcoholic health substances (alcoholic or hand-based anti-infectant also known as) were affected by popularity.
Most of them are used from alcohol isopropyl or ethanol along with gluing substances such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) and gel, or to facilitate the use and reduce the drying effect of an alcoholic fertilizer such as glycerin and are made in a liquid or coating form.
The addition of thin hydrogen peroxide increases more antimicrobial activity. Anti-infectants contain at least 60 to 95% of the effective microbial alcohol.
Anti-alcoholic infections cause the extinction of bacteria, resistant bacteria to multiple drugs (MRSA and VRE), cells and certain viruses (including HIV, tecalus, RSV, rhinovirus, cowberry, flu, and hepatitis) and rats.
Anti-infectants containing 70% of cells, 30 seconds after use, cause 99.97% (such as 3.5 logs equivalent to 35 CB) and 1 minute after use, cause 99.99% to 99.999% (such as 4 to 5 logs), but lower levels of bacteria are handled.
Alcoholic-based anti-infectants, almost against the type of neurovirus (or Norwalk), which is the most common cause of the disease of Sri Lanka, are completely ineffective. A sufficient amount of anti-infectants or alcohol-containing gel should be used to fully dry or cover both hands.
The back and on both hands and arms and ends of all fingers must be laid for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel is dried.
The finger neck should also be well washed with maled to both hands. The U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Disease is more recommended to wash hands in relation to the use of anti-infectant hands, especially when hands are completely dirty.
The use of these supplements is because of their ease to use them and their ability to quickly eradicate microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper washing of hands unless soap and water are available.
Recurring use of alcohol-based anti-hand contaminants can cause skin dryness unless skin softeners or moisturizers are added to their formulation.
Adding glycerin or other softeners to their formula can reduce or eliminate the effects of alcohol drying.
In clinical trials, anti-infectants that contained alcohol and softeners produced much less than soaps or antimicrobial substances, burning and dry skin.
Allergic contact disorders, hypercontact syndrome, or sensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hand-containing alcohol agents rarely occur.
Lower probability of contact pain compared to washing the hands with water and soap has caused their attractiveness.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based substances do not cleanse their hands from organic substances, but anti-infection.
This is why anti-infectants in the hand are not effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many diseases, as the disease factors still remain on the hands.
The effect of hand-free anti-alcoholic agents is severely dependent on the ingredients and their formulation and has historically been less influential than alcohol-containing anti-alcoholic agents.
Recently it has been shown that formulations that use benzalconium chloride after use have increased antimicrobial and accumulating activity, unlike alcohol that after frequent use, probably due to skin negative reactions, its effectiveness will decrease.
Many people in low-income communities can’t produce soap and instead use soap or soil.
Soil or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may have less effect than soap.
One of the concerns is that if soil or cough is infected with microorganisms, it may increase its spread instead of reducing the spread of the disease, contrary.
Cocktail is also like soap, an anti-infectant, as it forms in contact with an alcoholic solution.
In the absence of soap, the World Health Organization recommends the soap as a replacement of soap.
The proper hand-washing method recommended by U.S. Disease Control Centers to prevent the transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Current water is recommended because rocked water may be contaminated. While the water temperature does not seem to make any changes.
Take your hands enough soap and fill them, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes microbes on the skin and studies show that people tend to shine their hands more carefully when they use soap than when they use only water.
Hold your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Malding hands has created sticks and helps remove microbes from the skin, and malding hands for a longer period of time eliminates more microbes.
Wash your hands with good water.
Washing in the rocket water can contaminate your hand again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
The moisture and thick hands can easily be contaminated. Most of the remaining parts of the hand include finger washing, hand mash, area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and nail locks may sometimes be hidden from microorganisms.
Humidifying cream is often recommended to prevent the drying of the hands. Dry skin causes skin damage and can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
There are a variety of low cost options for ease of hand wash in developing countries in situations where water isn't available for pipes or soaps. For example, the rolling of water from a gallon or a hook container or a hook container, or a small amount of use of cocktail, such as a small amount of cocktail. In situations where water sources are limited, such as regions.
The tip type is a simple technology that is made of a container that is hedged by a hedge and a controlable hedge for a small amount of water on the hands and a soap mold.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand health process, but there are discussions about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
Increasing volume of research shows that paper towels are much healthier than electrical dryers that exist in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study with the support of the paper towel industry, the European mixture symposium was conducted by the University of West Minster in London to compare health levels of paper towels, hot air dryers and modern air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and the cough bacteria in the hands increased by 254%.
Drying hands with a drying machine led to an increase in the average of the total number of bacteria in the fingertips to 42% and 15% in the handbags.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased on average 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the fingertips.They also conducted experiments to determine whether other users are likely to transfer contamination from washing and washing environments due to the use of different methods of drying hands.
The air dryer, based on claims, pulls out the air at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 miles or 400 miles per hour), is able to push microorganisms out of hands and machinery and can potentially use other people who use the shower.
Using the drying machine hot air, it can spread microorganisms to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined various methods of drying the hands.
The following changes were seen in a number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers and hand dryers are compared with hand dryers with paper towels.
If soap and water are not available during travel, washing hands with anti-infectant towels can be used as a replacement method.
An alcohol-based anti-infectant should have at least 60% of alcohol.
Long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis diagnosed hand wash effect (in 1846) in prevention of disease in the hospital environment, he was forced to wash his hand.
There are electronic devices that can remind them if hospital employees forget to wash their hands.
A study found that the number of infections had decreased using them.
The time required for medical wash is at least 15 seconds, which is done using enough soap, water or gel and melting all parts of the hand.
My hands have to be cut off and my fingers are breaking together.
If there is a circle below the nails, it can be used for a year to remove it.
Since the microbes may remain in the blue on their hands, it is very important that their hands are well watered and dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, the paper towel should be used to close the water milk (and, if necessary, to open the output door).
This prevents the re-contamination of hands by means of contact with them.
The aim is to wash hands in the treatment centers, eliminate the microorganisms of the disease ("microscopes") and prevent them from being transferred.
The New England Medical Journal reports that handwashing is unacceptable in most hospital environments, so many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before contacting patients and thus transfer microorganisms.
A study found that adequate hands-washing and other simple steps can reduce up to 66% of the amount of blood flow contamination that Catter plays. The World Health Organization has published a sheet that indicates the standard method of hand-washing and hand-washing in healthcare departments.
The author of the hand health guide prepared by the organization on its website is also accessible to the public.
A review was conducted by Whitby and his colleagues.
If necessary for proof of compliance, commercial devices can measure and validate the amount of hand health.
The World Health Organization has identified the "Five Time" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids.
before doing work related to anti-infection, and
After patient care. Adding anti-infectant chemicals to the soap (the "medical" or "microbial anti-sap") causes a strengthening of the characteristics of the washing agent's slaughter.
Such measures may be considered before surgery or in the environment in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to have the following things: water that can be stained for screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screwless screws screwless screws screwless screws screws screws screws screws screws screws.
All jewelry must be removed.
This method requires hand and aid to wash the garlic for typically 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash long (10 minutes).
When scratching, prevent the water from returning to the aid in the hands.
After finishing the hands, the hands are dried with sterile fabric and the surgical clothes are covered.
To reduce emissions of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use the anti-infectant before and after the patient's care.
For controlling stafylococcus infections in hospitals, it has been found that the most beneficial of cleaning hands is obtained from 20% of the first washing, and when the cleaning rate reaches more than 35%, there is very little extra benefit.
Handwashing with usual soap is three times more transmitted to food than with antibacterial soap. The handwashing comparison with an antibacterial soap was 30 seconds to show handwashing with an antibacterial soap. The antibacterial soap was 6% with an antibacterial relatively contagious.
But the use of soap and water compared to the washing of hands with alcohol-based substances in reducing the influenza H1N1 type A virus and colesterol diphicyl is more effective than the hands. The necessary steps to improve hands health at health centers can include staff training for hands-washing, increased access to the patient.
More research requires to determine which of these measures is more effective in various healthcare environments.
In developing countries, it is learned to wash hands with soap as an affordable and essential tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
Nevertheless, the lack of reliable water, soap or hands-washing devices in homes, schools and workplaces challenges reaching the behaviour necessary to wash hands at global level.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, water milk to wash hands in close proximity to personal or public toilets, although there are cheaper options to build hands wash stations.
However, the low level of hand wash, more than due to the absence of soap or water, but can be the result of our bad habits.
Handwashing promotion with soap can affect electoral policies, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term change in behavior at society level.
Monitoring and evaluation is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of this work.
Systematic study 70 showed that society-based approaches to rise in low-income and average hand wash rates in countries are effective, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One of the samples to encourage the rivalry of the hand wash of their students to take their hands in schools, "tree stars" by UNICEF, who is the leader of the team.
With at least standard considerations, schools can finally get upgraded from one star to three stars.
The construction of hands-washing stations can be part of advertising hands-washing measures to reduce disease and death in children.
World Hand Laundering Day is another sample of consciousness programs that aims to create changes in people's behavior. As a result, the coronavirus pandemic 20-2019, UNICEF announced the use of hand laundering emojis.
A small number of studies, in general, rejected hand wash in developing countries with regard to the lost number of years due to inability.
However, a survey shows that promoting hand wash with soap compared to other measures is economically significantly more affordable.
For the first time, the importance of washing the hands for human health - especially for people who are vulnerable in situations such as newborn mothers or injured in the hospital - was identified by two-three-century precursors by Florence Mariale, who was a precursor to the health of the hands: Hungarian physician, Ignaz Semmelweis, and Ignaz Semmelweis.
At that time, most people believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smell called Mysma.
In the 1980s, the spread of food-related diseases and healthcare-related infections led to more widespread stimulation of healthcare centers in the United States as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The spread of pig flu in 2009 and pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand wash with soap to protect themselves against infectious diseases.
For example, posters entitled "correct hands-washing spirits" were installed in public toilets and toilets in German office buildings and airports.
The term "the hand of washing someone of something" means declaring a person's lack of desire to accept responsibility in taking a subject or sharing it.
This term is borrowed from the Matthew Bible, where Pontius Pilate was ashamed of deciding to crucify Christ, but this term is now used in some English communities with much wider use.
In McBeth Shakespeare, Ms. McBeth in an attempt to clean up an imagination, forced her hands to wash, showing her guilty conscience against the crime she had committed and also encouraged her wife to upgrade it.
It has also been revealed that after recalling or disregarding immoral actions, people tend to wash their hands more than others and tend to have more washing equipment.
In addition, people who allow their hands to be made after such a profoundness are less likely to participate in other "packing" compensation measures such as volunteer work.
Religion, recommend washing hands for health and symbolic purposes. Washing symbols and using water and soap for washing hands are a part of the washing of hands, which in many religions is included the washing of the hands, including the washing of Yahya, Hinduism, the washing of the hands, and the remembrance of the gold, the washing of the Jews.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam are ordering to wash their hands after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sicism, Jews and Islam recommend washing hands before and after every meal.
Controlling the risks of COVID-19 at work.
The risk control of COVID-19 at work means the use of health-safe methods to control risks to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
Suitable control of risks in the working environment depends on the workplace and the type of employment and should be carried out based on the assessment of risk resources, the severity of the disease in society and the risk factors for employees that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Health (OSHA), jobs that are less at risk, have less employment contacts with ordinary people and other colleagues and are essential measures to prevent infections, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home, in case of patients.
Employees that are averagely at risk include jobs where employees need frequent or close contact with people who are not with COVID-19 or are suspected, but may be infected because of the continuing spread of the virus in society or because of international travel.
This includes those who are in contact with general people, for example in schools, the working environments of a lot of population and in some high-volume retailers.
The risk control for this group, in addition to basic measures of prevention of infection, includes air conditioning through high-reducing air filters, softening and having personal protection equipment in case of a COVID-19 person.
The U.S. Department of Safety and Health (OSHA) of health care workers who are in contact with people with COVID-19 or suspects, including those who are at high risk of getting paid or being at high risk of getting paid or being at high risk of persons. If employees are at high risk, they are doing work that leads to simultaneous production of particles.
The appropriate method for risk control for these people includes engineering controls such as creating negative pressure air-conditioning rooms and using personal protection equipment that suits the job duties.
COVID-19 can have different effects on the working environment.
Employees may not be involved due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of potential confrontation.
Commercial patterns may change, either in terms of the quality required and in terms of the way of access to these goods (such as buying in unemployed hours or buying through delivery services at home or purchasing with car).
Eventually, transportation of items from geographical areas that are severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped. Preparation and programs necessary to respond to infectious diseases can be used to guide protective measures.
These programs examine and take care of risks associated with different jobs and tasks including risk risks, risk factors caused by home and social environments, and individual risk factors for employees such as aging or chronic diseases.
It also describes the control measures necessary to address those risks as well as possible programs to cope with situations that may occur as a result of the spread.
Preparation necessary and plans prepared to react to infectious diseases may be regular to national or local recommendations.
The objectives of reaction to the spread of the disease include reducing the transmission of the disease among employees, protecting people who are most vulnerable to health side effects, maintaining commercial activities and minimizing negative effects on other institutions in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in areas where commercial activities take place affects decisions taken.
The range of risk controls includes a framework that is widely working in safety and job health so that it can classify risk controls that are consistent with their effectiveness.
In cases where there is no possibility to remove COVID-19 risks, the most effective methods of control, engineering controls and follow administrative controls and ultimately personal protection equipment.
The engineering control method requires keeping employees away from the risks arising from work without relying on employee behavior and can be affordable to the most expensive solution that can be implemented.
The administrative control method includes changes in the policy or working method implemented by an employee or employer.
Personal protection equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and administrative control methods, but can prevent some exposure to the virus.
All types of PPEs must be selected on the basis of the risk for employees, properly installed (e.g., respiratory equipment), continuously and properly covered, regularly checked, maintained, replaced, cleaned, or maintained properly.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Health (OSHA), jobs that are less at risk have less employment contacts with normal people and other colleagues.
Essential measures recommended to prevent infection in all working environments are hand wash, encourage the workers to stay at home if they are sick, take care of breathtaking equipment including mouth covering and needing to wear in the mouth and wear in the mouth, wear in the mouth, wear in the wear and wear, provide paper and wear in the wear, wear in the wear, wear in the wear
The rapid identification and separation of people who are potentially infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and other people at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of severe respiratory disease should stay at home at a time without using fever reducing or other alternating drugs for symptoms, fever, fever and other disease symptoms. This should also be the case for patients to be free for at least 24 hours, and that policies should be permitted.
According to the Department of Safety and Health (OSHA), jobs at the average level at risk include jobs in which employees need frequent contact or close contact with less than six feet (1.8 meters) distances with people who are not affected by COVID-19, or who are suspected of COVID-19, or who are affected by COVID-19, but may not be affected.
It includes the employees, which have the need for the public. They have the need to contact. For example, the need for the public. They have the need for the public. They have the need for the public. They have the need for the public. They have the need for the need for the public. They have the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for the need for.
Employees who are at risk in this group rarely need to use the respiratory device.
If a person gets sick inside the plane, appropriate methods to protect employees and other passengers may include separating a person from others to a distance of 6 feet, assigning only one of the staff to provide the patient's service and providing a face mask to the patient, or requesting the patient to cover his mouth and vision when heating or moisture.
Airplane crew should use one-time medical towels when taking care of a patient or contacting contaminated fluids or levels, and should use more personal protection equipment if a person has fever, persistent headache or respiratory problems.
Towels and other items should be inserted into the biological risk bag and contaminated levels should then be cleaned and anti-infected. For commercial transport including cruise vessels and other passenger vessels, it should be controlled by the deportation of the deportation of the deportation of the deportation of the deportation of other risks during the disease, the deportation of the deportation of the individual and the deportation of the deportation.
In ideal mode, medical tracking must be done in a quarantine individual cabin. For schools and children's care centres, if an infected person has entered a school building regardless of the spread of disease, CDCs close the site for a short period of time to clean or prevent the disease.
In the event that disease is transmitted in society in a small or medium-sized manner, the following steps can be taken in the direction of social distancing: abolition of scientific tours, gatherings and other major meetings such as physical training classes, or consuming foods for the unsecondness of cafes, increasing the distance between the tables, the distancing of the distancing and the distancing.
When there is a significant possibility of transmission of disease in society, in addition to social distance methods, long-term school holidays should be taken into account. For law enforcement officers who perform their daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) below the immediate health risk.
The law enforcement officers who need to be connected with people with COVID-19 or suspects are advised to follow instructions for emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protection equipment.
If people are closely contacted at the time of arrest, employees must use their belts and equipment before re-use using clean cleaning sprays or anti-infecting handles, while following the standard methods used for use and paying personal protection equipment (PPE) and wash clothes.
The U.S. Department of Safety and Health (OSHA) knows healthcare workers, including those at high risk.
Works at high level at risk include employees of the healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transport department that are exposed to people who are affected by COVID-19 or suspected.
Employees whose work leads to the production of discontinued particles in the air, or samples of people who are affected by COVID-19 or who are suspected to collect, move or treat, are at a very high risk.
Works that lead to the production of injected particles in the air include pipelines, headaches, broncoscopes, and some dental operations and examinations or assault samples of the patient.
Employees at a very high risk include employees who are engaged in preparing the bodies of people who have died or are suspected of COVID-19. In case they are suspected, the level of risk is very high in production. Additional methods of engineering control for this group include the creation of separate rooms for patients who are suspected of COVID-19.
Negative pressure cooling may be suitable for some healthcare centers.
Patient examples should be taken into account by taking steps to protect the healthcare of level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be held in a specific and separate waiting room. In addition to the use of other personal protection tools, the Department of Safety and Health also uses craftsmen (OSHA) to produce craftsmen (OSHA) and craftsmen (OSHA), the use of craftsmen's respiratory device from craftsmen (OSHA) or craftsmen who are limited to craftsmen.
In the United States, the N95 respiratory filter, approved by NIOSH, is used for the benefit of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes appropriate tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory devices can have more protection and use it easier for employees. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of whole body covering because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only the use of surgical masks to deploy people at entry points.
The World Health Organization recommends that people who collect samples of the respiratory system or take care of or carry them from COVID-19 patients and do not do anything that leads to the production of particles in the air, use surgery, glass or facial protection mask, guns and sleeves.
In the event of the work in which particles are produced in the air, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respiratory device.
Given that the global provision of personal protection tools is not enough, the Global Health Organization recommends the following things to minimize the need for personal protection tools: to do medical examinations unprecedentedly, to create physical obstacles for the patient, such as protecting the patient, installing transparent windows, allowing the patient to enter the room, just as correctly.

We see ourselves this month in a significant situation.
The disease of all COVID-19 is something that clearly clarifies the global consistency of humans and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best reaction depends on the cohesion, cooperation and socialization that is in the heart of the organization.
The companionship and level of care that we have seen among our colleagues via email, contact, and chat shows incredible people that we have the chance and pride to work alongside them.
I am very proud and proud of all of you as a co-worker.
Last week, someone appreciated what we do.
They reminded me of how much it means that the world can now visit Wikipedia and what a powerful sign that this important source can be online and available to everyone.
Your work provides this possibility, whether you keep the websites up to date, or our colleagues receive money, or our communities are safe.
The world, now more than any other time, needs information that Wikipedia provides.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but also the way we work will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will implement significant assessments in how to do our joint work from the beginning of next week.
Relationships relating to our work and programs
As Robin mentioned earlier, the team C met last night for discussions on the approach and our plan for days and months to come.
During the conversation, we made a decision that we thought is the right answer to what we are facing, and the best way to maintain the organization in this period.
We wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce it, there is no problem.
All employees, contractors and contractors:
Until secondary, we expect 4 hours of work a day or 20 hours of work a week.
We don't declare a vacation - if you can work more regular hours, you're going to hurt this mission.
However, the world is currently unpredictable and doesn’t matter if you care about your dear friends, buy food, or visit a doctor, your health is priority for us.
We don't track your time.
If you are sick, don’t work.
This should go without saying, but we say that.
You don’t need to get a personal break or leave – just tell your manager and help your group to browse calendars and programs and make sure someone has covered key works.
(If your COVID-19 test results have been detected positively, please inform Bryan of the T&C section so that T&C can help you and make sure your situation is properly managed).
The salaries of employees working for an hour are paid in full.
As we have said before, we are standing on our commitments to contractors and co-workers who work an hourly way.
The salary is paid on the basis of normal working hours in normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are sick and you are unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to eliminate their stress in the world around us.
What we do, especially in such cases, can be very valuable.
Again, it's your own care.
We ask you to contact your manager to know what we should expect and to be able to plan in line with it.
Some things are necessary.
There are events that we have to do.
SRE, HR Ops, trust and security and capital attraction (and some other) teams do fundamental and important work that may require more support.
We will start the process with other departments to assess the current goals and focus on supporting the essential things for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we all will focus on the most basic projects.
If we do the process now, we won’t see any damage later.
We don’t have a plan to work twice as soon as we end up and work out.
You are not expected to work additional hours to achieve the time that is now impossible.
We accept that conditions have changed and we will try to set new goals and timetables if necessary.
What's the APP (annual application)?
In order to match the new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to modify our 2021-2020 annual delivery schedule.
Our goal is to suggest the 2020-2019 programme extension that gives us more time for budgeting and allows employees to be able to prioritize vital work, take care of themselves and care of their loved ones, and to include those who need it or want to work less hours in the next few weeks.
This time extension reduces the pressure of current working programs throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and inform the representatives and teams in the next steps as soon as they are confirmed.
Thanks to the annual team planning for the leadership.
Office status, being exposed to disease and cleaning
Last week, we reported that one of the SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, for more caution, we hired a anti-virus cleaner team to anti-infect the entire level at the San Francisco Office.
They used the anti-virus solution of a hospital to anti-infect all levels, as well as to the labyrinth and elevator that leads to our floor.
The building uses its care protocol and uses products that are useful for the health of its residents.
We are sure that when we decide back, the office will be well prepared.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork and they shared their COVID-19 protocol with us and all employees located in DC.
According to the San Francisco State instructions, our Washington DC office has been transformed into a totally remote set since last week.
As some of our co-workers are aware of, we also have talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions will continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Old co-workers who work with us on a remote basis know that this can be a conditional match and want to have recommendations to you:
Maximize the period of sessions to one or two hours.
If it takes longer sessions, check how to hold them in a few days.
Clearly specify the session, follow the instructions and send the material necessary to study before.
Set up the video with default tools like Google Docs and Zoom so you can make it easier to collaborate and communicate live.
Determine the person responsible for the meeting, the person responsible for chatting, the person responsible for tracking questions and list of speakers, and the person responsible for recording (or joint recording).
If you need a convenient target, send an email to the technical support group.
Use your healthcare costs for the mid-promise.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about shared work.
The Human Resources Operational Team is looking for a web-based ergonomic guide to support the increase in divisional work across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of financial scores on the foundation level such as editathon to cancel public events that take place with the Wikipedia budget until the World Health Organization has not declared the end of the world.
We inform them that we know that our request for cancellation of other applications and limitations may be impossible to carry out agreed activities relating to obtaining financial points and no one will be punished for delay or correction of their objectives.
Next week we will provide more instructions on Wikimania and other topical and regional social associations.
It seems to be a public feeling throughout the global community, both discomfort due to these disturbances and at the same time a feeling of relief due to their transparency and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikipedia, etc.
As we go forward, CRT is trying to create a page on Meta-Wiki so that space is placed in the community to take into account the influences that we have entered and keep our communications with them.
Involving issues related to COVID-19
We will send for the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC time at 07:00 PT time, a meeting invitation for special employees to your calendars.
We use this time and provide you with new and more information, answer your questions and spend some time in contact with each other.
We are all together and we are here to help you in any way possible.
In addition, you can find relevant information through this email and other information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT updates these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with a range of employees who are residents of countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, main workflow, or challenge news coverage, or anything else you might need to help, please not inform and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help and support you if necessary.
If you want to talk about a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judan - International Human Resources Operations Manager.
None of these changes should be taken as leaving our work and commitments.
It is the point that at this time our work and commitments are likely to need to be adapted to the way we haven’t had in the past.
These are the stages we believe is essential to support each other so that we can continue to work and support our own movement and provide the services that worlds have to offer to them.
What we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for important work that will be done in weeks and possibly months ago.
We need all of you to achieve this, so we want you to be careful for your own and your families so that you can be in your best condition when the need increases.

b'enzyme converter of angiotansine 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that lies to the external level (cell cleaning) of lung cells, arthritis, heart, joint and gut.
The associated enzyme activity of ACE2 converter (ACE) by reducing the amount of ACE-II and increasing (Ang(1-7) interferes with its ability to become a hopeful medication target for heart disease treatment. ACE2 also acts as a point of entry to cells for some coronary viruses.
Human version of this enzyme is often called hACE2.
The enzyme converter is a type of methaloenzyme that is located on the surface of the endotil cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal C-calcium amino-container domain.
ACE2 is a single-transient type I glue protein that is located in its enzyme active area around the level of lung cells and other tissues.
The outer cell domain of ACE2, along with another enzyme, is severely separated from the traction domain, and the solvent protein obtained after entry into the bloodstream is finally administered with urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 connects mostly to the vacuum cells of type II vacuum cells, small intestinal productions, intricate and black cells, and most of the body's liquid muscle cells.
Signs of ACE2 mRNA are seen in brain cortex, planned body, hypothalamus, and brain legs.
The main function of ACE2 is the activity as an ACE fertilizer.
ACE transforms the hormone of angiotensin I into angiotensin detenting reed II.
ACE2, in turn, separates Phenyl Alanin Amino Carboxylic Acid-Terminal from AngiotensinII (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and to Angiotensin Rig Gasha (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Ile-Tyr-His-OH-Pro)
ACE2 can break down a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9]-Bradi Kin, apelin, neurotensin, dinofrine A, and graline.
ACE2 also regulates the fluctuation of SLC6A19 canoic amino acid and plays a role in the development of Hard Nap disease.
ACE2, as a traction protein, plays the main point of entry to cells for some coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (Sares Virus) and SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19 Virus).
Most importantly, spatic S1 protein binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses leads to an enzymatic ACE2 domain at cell levels and to the transmission of the virus and enzymes in cells.
This input process requires the preparation of protein S through TMPRSS2 host proteins that is considered its suspension in the current research process as a possible treatment. This is assumed that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help cope with infection.
However, professional communities and many supervisory institutions have suggested that treatment continues with the standard ACE suspension and ARB.
The rule review and Pharathal, published on 11 July 2012, stated that “the use of ACE holders is linked to a dramatic decrease of 34 per cent of the probability of stealing compared to controls.”
In the meantime, “the probability of stroke has decreased in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher probability of stroke, especially those suffering from stroke and cardiac insufficiency.
The use of ACE inhibitors was linked to a reduction in detrimental damage, although the results were less likely compared to the overall probability of detrimental damage.”
It is believed that human ACE (rhACE2) is considered to be a new treatment for hardened liver damage and apparently improved the homodynamic respiratory and oxygen abundance in pigs with hardened respiratory dystry syndrome caused by lipopoly sacaride.
The rhACE2 half-life in humans is about 10 hours and starts working 30 minutes plus a 24-hour effect period.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a drug for people who are sensitive to systemic and classical rhino-angiotansin inhibitors (RSA inhibitors) or anangiotansin II circulatory enhancer factor diseases. The effect of rhACE2 injecting in anesthesia in clinical trials.
The COVID-19 programs are mobile applications that work to run a call during the 20-2019 pandemic coronavirus, i.e. the identification process of people (links) who are likely to have contacted the infected person.
Several programs have been developed or proposed to deal with support from government officials in some countries and regions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the development of calling programs.
Problems with privacy, particularly in community-based geographical locations of users of the app, are raised.
From less interfering solutions, you can point out using Bluetooth signals to close the user to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that the supportability of Bluetooth-Moor apps will be directly accessed to Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government of China has developed a program in collaboration with Alipay to help people find out whether they have contacted people with COVID-19.
The program has been used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, it is used by a program called TraceTogether.
The program has been developed by the local IT community, is published open-source and will be left to the government. Northern Macedonia has published the Bluetooth-Mohri program called "StopKorona!" to address potential contacts with infected people and provide immediate responses to the treatment providers.
The program has been developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the app will be waiting for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the calling programme is in advanced stage and will be set up in a few weeks. The similar program ("StopCovid") will be implemented in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and Zelando consider programs based on the modern TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geographical range programme for COVID-19 patients and Moscow residents, to prevent these people from leaving home.
Russell Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has pointed out a number of application problems related to the program-moor environments, including potential positive and inefficiency results if the program is used in small population samples.
Apple has applied restrictions on the types of organizations that are authorized to add coronavirus programs to the App Store by examining problems related to the extension of Coronavirus malicious or harmful programs and only authorizes "official" or credible organizations to do such things.
Google and Amazon have also implemented similar limitations.
Privacy defenders have expressed concerns about the consequences of public surveillance using coronavirus programs and have stated, in particular, that it is uncertain whether the surveillance infrastructure created for coronavirus pandemic will be threatened after the end of this threat.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for a statement to restrict this type of supervision.
These organizations have set eight terms for government plans:
The supervision must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The guards and controls must have arms with the possibility of automatic cancellation;
The application of data should be limited to cases related to COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be ensured and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital monitoring shouldn't be a thermographer of discrimination and irritation;
The transfer of data to third parties must be within the framework of the law;
Guarantees must be taken into account to prevent abuse and the right of citizens to complain of abuse;
The targeted participation of all “related actors” including public health experts and groups in the field of health is essential. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published lists.
The Google/Apple proposed program is offered to address the problem of continuous monitoring through removal of the device’s drivers from their device operating systems, after fixing the need.
In some countries, instead of the program, the network-made location process has been used and, as a result, the need to download the program and the ability to escape has disappeared.
In Israel, the network rivalry has been adopted.
Network-shaped solutions that have access to local raw data may violate privacy.
However, it is not the case that all communities with a central server need access to personal location data; a number of private memory communities use central servers only for internal communications (see below).
In South Korea, a non-programmed community was used to lead contact.
This community, instead of using the specialized program, collected driving information from various sources including mobile drive data and card interaction data, and worked to communicate messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to communicate to potential audiences, the information is available to the public. This type of information is disclosed due to extensive changes in data protection laws, due to the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is made publicly available through a number of applications and websites. Some countries such as Germany have reviewed the use of focused communities and privacy memory.
By April 6, 2020, these details have not yet been disclosed.
Contact with privacy is accepted the concept that the history of documentary research relating to it will return to at least 2013.Until April 7, 2020, dozens of master’s groups are working on privacy memory routers, such as the use of “low Bluetooth energy” (BLE) mobile phones, to register other users closely.
However, PEPP-PT is an effort to coordinate the focused and non-concentrated approaches and is not independent protocols. From non-concentrated protocols, you can “recover unconcentrated close proximity to privacy” (DP-PPT and DP-3T), “progressive contact numbers” (TCN), “progressive contact numbers”, “progressive contact numbers”, “progressive” (TCN, noted).
In these protocols, personal identity data will never be removed from the device and all the matching things occur within the device.
The “Privacy Directorate” in the MIT Media Testing Centre has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy memory practices in the process of collecting and using localization and tracking data, to manage the COVID-19 spreading process.
This platform, based on the results of the research, was developed in the official report "Applications Entertainment: Privacy Keeping in the Period of All-time", which was published in March 2020.Other similar innovation is the Enigma MPC product Enigma platform. It is involved in the development of privacy technologies, which are engaged in the "prosecution" process.
SafeTrace with secure hardware technologies allows users to provide sensitive local and health data, without violating data privacy, to other users and administrators.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Alliance was formed by a number of groups. These groups were focused on what was essentially the same protocols and mostly the same, with the aim of reducing and providing global cooperation in the field of leadership and warning programs.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that the BlueTrace Protocol, which had been implemented in its official government plan, had been publicly enforced.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the controllers of Android and iOS mobile platforms, urged a calling initiative that they claim to maintain privacy. This initiative is based on a combination of low-blooth energy technology and encryption of privacy.
They have also published the specifications of the main technology used in this body.
According to Apple and Google, this body will be launched in three stages:
Introduction of the power-building tools of governments to create coronavirus relief programs with the ability to maintain privacy
Direct integration of this feature on iOS and Android. Google and Apple intend to resolve the problems of acceptance and continuous monitoring by distributing this body by updating the operating system and then deleting it in a similar way after threatening.
(b) The alternative of the drug (known to the change of application, change of representation, change of duty or therapy transfer) is said to change the approved drug application for the treatment of disease or physical problems that were different from what the drug was originally developed for it.
This is a pathway of scientific research that is implemented to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research goals can be referred to the development of COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of improved individual plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 pharmaceutical proteins, each of which has several ligand connection sites.
The analysis of these sites provides a reasonable plan for the development of effective anti-virus drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important target proteins SARS-CoV-2 can be referred to the semiconductor protein, RNA-related RNA polymerase, helicopter, S protein and ADP ribofosfatase.

Use of it may not be safe for pregnant women or people who want to become pregnant.
The study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), the antiviral combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, showed that “no benefit has been seen”.
These drugs are designed to prevent HIV reproduction by gluing to protein.
A group of researchers at the University of Clarado have tried to rectify these drugs to find a combination that could fit into SARS-CoV-2 protein. In the scientific community, criticisms on the guidance of resources to change the use of drugs designed for HIV/AIDS treatment.
The World Health Organization introduces lopinavir/ritonavir to the international “unity” study.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later detected that Remdesivir was active in a laboratory environment against philo, pio, paramicus and corona viruses.
One of the problems of antiviral therapy is to create resistance through anxiety, which may lead to more severe diseases and prevention.
Some preliminary pre-examination studies suggest that Remdesivir may be an effective genetic obstacle to forming. Several clinical trials, including two cases in which the Cleveland educational hospital is present, are in the course. One person suffers from mild disease and another person suffers from severe disease.
Three clinical trials on the effect of intra-oride vitamin C injection on people with severe COVID-19 disease have been carried out. Two of them are controlled with drugs (China and Canada) and a lack of control (Italy).

In April, CEPI’s initiative requirements for vaccine development are the speed, production capacity, stability in scale and access across the globe.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms were under investigation and development in early 2020 to produce effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The main objectives of the platform that have entered phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I expander and vaccine suggested: Medina, mRNA-1273)
Virus carrier (phase I expander and vaccine proposed: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus carrier type 5)
According to the CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccines have been proposed in the initial stages of development, 78 of which have been approved as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 other cases have been publicly published, but some of them are not publicly available (i.e. they are scheduled or designed).
Phase I-II testing processes the case-by-case safety, usually random and controlled by drugs, in various centers, and determines more precise and effective doses.
Phase III studies usually include more participants in a control group and under the vaccine's efficacy test to prevent disease, treated by adverse effects at the optimal dose.
From 79 vaccines suggested in the stage of active development (born until early April 2020), 74 cases have not yet been tested on humans (now at the stage of the clinical pre-development).

B'bimiary coronary virus 2019 (Covid-19) is a type of infectious disease known as a chronic respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) factor.
General signs of fever, headache and breathing.
Other signs can indicate fatigue, muscle pain, swelling, glande, hearing falls and stomach pain.
The distance of time facing the disease factor to the emergence of the symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most of the cases lead to mild symptoms, some of the cases occur in the nature of a virus and multi-organic deficiency.
Until April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories around the world, 153,000 of which have been killed.
More than 568,000 people have improved. This virus is mostly transmitted by close contact, often through drops of rice caused by swelling, softening or speech.
Although the decay causes the release of these drops, the drops usually drop instead of moving on a long distance on Earth or on surfaces.
People can get infected by touching the levels and then touching the eyes, sight, and mouth.
The virus can survive for 72 hours at levels.
The probability of the end is higher in the first three days after the emergence of signs. Of course, there is also a possibility of the release of the virus before the emergence of signs and in the next stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis, the instant reactive rRT-PCR (rRT-PCR) chain reaction is a momentum chronic reaction from the nasovarrenx soap.
The use of the mask is suggested for suspected people with the virus and their surroundings.
Recommended use of masks is different for the general people; some people are opposed to the use of masks and some agree to it, and some wear masks are compulsory.
There is currently no vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local disease transfers have been registered in most countries of every six areas covered by the WHO.
People with this virus may have signs or signs of flu like fever, headache, fatigue and breathing.
Urgency signs can be referred to breathing difficulties, pain or continuous pressure in the breast area, anxiety, walking difficulties and fatigue of the face or lips. If these signs are not addressed, you should immediately consult your doctor.
Signs related to the upper respiratory circle, such as injury, vision or glandure, have also been seen with less swelling.
E-adrenal signs such as swelling, eruption and swelling have been observed in varied percentages.
Some cases in China in the initial stage had only suffered from severe breathing and heartbeat.
In some other cases, the disease may continue until the stage of the disease, multi-organic deficiency, and even death.
This period is called the end-of-the-art period.
The COVID-19 period is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, signs appear within 11.5 days of the moment of contamination. Reports show that all infected people do not necessarily have signs.
The role of these pregnant women without any signs in the process of transmission is still uncertain. Of course, the case-by-case evidence suggests that these individuals can be a disease spread factor.
The ratio of people without a sign is currently unclear and is in the hands of a test. “Corean disease control and prevention centres” (KCDC) have announced that 20% of all cases confirmed remained in a hospital without signs.
The “National Health Commission of China” began to defeat unsignificant cases in its statistics from 166 infections on the day, 130 (78%) were unsignificant during the trial.
A mixture and a mixture may be pregnant.
Speaking with a loud voice spreads more particles than speaking easily.
Singapour researchers have shown that dizziness of mouth and vision during the swallowing can cause rice drops to be released to a distance of 4.5 metres (15ft).
Although this virus is usually not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has announced that there is a possibility of air transfer and that positive sample effects related to the virus have been seen in air collectors installed outside the room.
Some medical roles such as pipeling and respiratory respiration (CPR) can cause the spread of respiratory and virus spread through the air.
Although there are concerns about the transmission of the virus through defence, this is unlikely to be assumed. The probability of the transmission of the virus through people has a greater sign. The probability of the virus is low prior to the emergence of signs.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has announced that despite the non-disease, each person usually infects two to three people. The duration of the virus is at a few hours to a few days.
In particular, the virus on the canvas survives for one day, on the plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and 99% on the brass for up to four hours.
This time depends on humidity and temperature.
The correct use of soap and soap is also effective. The soap products eliminate the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivate it and remove from the skin and other levels.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxidine gluconates (surgical engineering), have less effect. In the study conducted in Hong Kong, samples were taken an average of two days after the start of the body.
In five out of six patients, the first sample of the virus was shown for the first time, and in the sixth patient, the highest virus was seen in the second day test.
Heavy respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of heavy respiratory syndrome that was initially taken from three people with a rain character and associated with the group of heavy respiratory diseases in Wohan.
All new signs of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in coronaviruses with a related nature.
This virus is eliminated outside the human body with domestic soap. Protective soap eliminates it. SARS-CoV-2 has a primary close relationship with SARS-CoV.
Covid-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs because the virus is introduced into the host cells through the enzyme 2 converter of angiotensine (ACE2), which is a lot in the lung cells of type II.
This virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called spack (polymer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cells.
Injury to heart has been observed in 12% of people who have been infected and infected in the Wohan Hospital. This problem is more common in severe disease cases.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms due to the reaction of the semitic inflammatory and immune system disorders in the advancement process of the disease is basically but the severe microcardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are large in the heart and play a role in the heart activity.
The high rate of thermosis (31%) and thermosis urinary (25%) has been observed in patients with ICU with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with a weak diagnosis. The abnormality of people who have suffered from COVID-19 has been a cause of injury in COVID-19.
Although SARS-COV-2 tends to ACE2 in the respiratory system, severe symptoms of systemic inflammation have been seen in COVID-19 patients.
In particular, the pathogenic connection of GM-CSF screening T cells with IL-6 screening monocytes and severe lung pathology has been demonstrated in COVID-19 patients.
Influence of lenocyte has also been reported during the calibration.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of diagnosis is the rRT-PCR (rRT-PCR) chain reaction.
This test is usually carried out on breathing samples that are obtained with Nazofrenx soap. Of course, it is also applied to a mixed soap or soap.
The results are usually prepared within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but it is necessary to take two blood samples at a distance of two weeks. This type of test does not have a lot of direct value.
Chinese scientists were able to separate a kind of coronavirus and publish it genetically. In this way, laboratories around the world were able to carry out independent polymer chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect viral infections.
Until April 4, 2020, Pattan tests (which have the ability to detect active infections and the history of an individual abtalic) were studied in the hand, but still haven't been used.
The precision of this Chinese experiment in the field of testing is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA approved the first care point test in the United States on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnosis instructions of the Zhong Nan Hospital from the University of Wohan suggested methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and all-risk.
The multi-lobulous mat glass curve uses its side-distribution, incomparable and retroactive to detect in the initial stages of infection.
Survival of the subcutaneous, low coating (tickness of a leopard with a fluctuating foam) and severity may be a sign of advancement of the disease.
There isn't much information on microscopic damage and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The most important pathological findings in the curriculum are:
Microscopy: membrane origin, precard, heart severity and breathing
Four levels of severity of the virus are visible:
Light Rain: Respirational Adam, Hyperplasy Penocyte, Large Penocyte Nangarra, Gastrointestinal inflammation with Influence Penocyte and Multi-Hypocyte Large Cell Forming
A severe rear character: Dispergered foam damage (DAD) with dispergered foam shapes.
DAD is a hard respiratory disorder (ARDS) and a severe hypoxical factor.
Improved sweat origin: Formation of shapes in the foam holes and respiratory fibers
Blood: Strength in the diffuser (DIC); lucitroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the probability of infection can be indicated to stay at home, self-esteem from being present in occupied places, wash your hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, breathing health and fear of touching eye, sight or mouth without hand washed.
CDC suggests covering the mouth and vision with paper handles during the sweat and softening and use of the inner part of the harvest, if the handle is not provided.
It is recommended that healthcare should be maintained after a fever or anxiety.
CDC has suggested the use of tissue masks in public locations, to prevent the spread of disease by people without signs. Social distancing strategies are pursuing to reduce contacts with polluted people with large groups by locking schools and workplaces, limiting travel and canceling large tours.
Distance instructions also include compliance with at least 6 ft (1.8 meters) distance between individuals.
There is no effective medication to prevent COVID-19 disease. Since the discovery of the vaccine is not conceived by at least 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management process is the same “curve deflation” or “curve deflation”.
CDC also suggests people to wash their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water. This wash, especially after the outlet of the toilet or the obvious contamination of their hands, before eating food, and after removal of vision, dizziness or softness, is more necessary.
CDC also suggests the use of hand alcoholic anti-infectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol content if water and soap are not supplied. For areas where ordinary fertilizers are not available, the WHO has offered two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, an antimicrobial agent is obtained from ethanol or isopropanol.
It is used to remove microbial hagues from hydrogen proxide; “This is not an active substance to anti-infection.”
Glycerol is added as a moisture holder.
People are managed with support care that can include therapeutic fluid, oxygen support and other vital organs damaged.
CDC suggests people who are suspected to use a simple mask.
The oxygenation of bronchial oxidation (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory insufficiency problems, but its benefits are still under review.
Individual health care and change in lifestyle and family diet are proposed to strengthen safety.
Supporting treatments may be beneficial for people with mild signs in the initial stages of infection. WHO and the “China National Health Commission” have provided suggestions for care for people who are treated as a result of COVID-19.
Specialist care professionals and Rhea specialists in the United States have collected therapeutic suggestions of various institutions in the form of a free source called IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To fix the symptoms, some medical professionals have diagnosed the use of parastamol (staminanofen) for the first line intake better than ibuprofen.
It is necessary to reduce the probability of virus transmission, adherence to precautions, especially in the treatment locations where molecular molecular rollers, such as pipeling or manual ventilation, are carried out.
For therapeutic professionals who take care of COVID-19 people, CDC maintains individuals in the “Aerospace Infection Act” (AIIR) and the use of standard precautions, suggests prevention of calling and precautions in the aviation period. CDC recommends personal precautions in the aviation.
The proposed instruments include: Ghan PPE, breathing mask or face mask, eye protector and surgical gloves. If there is, use of breathing mask (instead of face mask) is priority.
The N95 respiratory mask has been approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the use of the mask with the “Urgent Consumption” (EUA).
This mask is designed to protect against air particles such as the bulb, but its effectiveness is not guaranteed against specific biological factors for use outside the main application.
If the mask is not available, the CDC suggests the use of facial protector or as the last solvent, the handmaske.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that it is necessary to use mechanical equipment or alternative methods, but a percentage of them requires these measures.
Type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19 respiratory insufficiency is examined in the hands of people who are busy. Some evidence suggests that with the current-palla cannotary can prevent aid or medium-positive pressure in the respiratory circuit, pipelines can be prevented.
The fact that each of these two methods leads to similar benefits in patients is still unclear.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical apparatus in the event, because this method limits the proportion of rice proliferation particles compared to the streaming-balan vision cannole. The spread of severe cases is greater in elderly people (aged over 60 years, and especially in persons over 80 years).
In many developed countries, the hospital bed is not enough. As a result, the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in cases of severe abtail is limited to COVID-19 that require buildings.
A study in China found that 5% of patients are built in the special care sector, 2.3% need mechanical equipment and 1.4% die.
In China, about 30% of people living in the hospital due to COVID-19 are finally being taken care of in the ICU.
Mechanical harassment becomes more complicated because hard respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) increases in COVID-19 intensity and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
In order to maximize the quantity of oxygen and casting of the possibility of breast damage associated with the carrier and breast swelling machine, the use of the carrier machine with high pressure control and PPEP modes is essential.
The old-fashioned guards may not be high.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs were in the clinical trial stage.
Remdesivir is apparently the most hopeful among drugs.
Although the development of new drugs will take up to 2021, several cases of drugs under test have been previously approved for other banks or are in advanced test stages.
Antivirus drugs can be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO has suggested that volunteers participate in tests related to the effectiveness and safety of potential drugs. The FDA has issued clearance plasma as a temporary trial therapy; of course, in cases where a person’s death is severely or completely at risk.
This medicine is not resistant to clinical studies necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety associated with the disease.
In February 2020, China issued a mobile app to manage the pathogenity process.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The program can identify the "nearest contact" with the help of monitoring data and detect the possibility of the disease.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the program, in addition to providing a home quarantine proposal, reports the subject to local health authorities. From Clan-Date analysis on mobile phones, facial detection technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence. It is used to track contaminated people and associated with them.
In March 2020, the Israeli government made it possible to deliver mobile data from suspected people of COVID-19 to security institutions.
This action took place to protect the Qur’an and to protect people who are likely to have contacted contaminated citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also provided data collecting the location of the telephone under Robert Koh, from the Federal State Institutions of Germany, to enable research on and preventing the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial detection technology to identify anti-Qur'an people.
Giulio Gallera, Italian Regional Health Officer, has been informed by mobile operators that “40 percent of people continue to go freely and hopefully.”
The German Heckton government spent 48 hours a week with more than 42,000 people.
Kersti Kaljulaid, the Estonian President, also called for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Curtains, travel limitations, treatment side effects or fear of infection may cause people stress.
“Adding social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, mental pressure and economic problems can change people’s mental and physical health,” Rory O’Connor said.
This disease may be low or insignificant at some stages and causes symptoms such as other common diseases that affect the upper respiratory disorder, such as cold.
Mild cases usually improve within two weeks, but the improvement of people suffering from severe or severe diseases may take three to six weeks.
Based on data related to other similar viruses, such as Sarris and Mars, pregnant women may be part of COVID-19 risk groups; of course, there is no much information about COVID-19 in hand. In some people, COVID-19 may involve the lungs and cause the root.
In poor people, COVID-19 can quickly become a rigid respiratory dystrose syndrome (ARDS) and cause respiratory insufficiency, shock or multi-organic deficiency.
Consequences related to COVID-19 can be indicated by infection, unusual decay of blood and heart failure, calcium and liver.
Blood degradation, particularly an increase in protrombine time, has been observed in 6% of people who were settled in the hospital due to COVID-19.
In nearly 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen signs of an increase in hepatic enzyme (transaminase).
According to the report, the average time distance between signs and death was ten days, from which five days was associated with ease.
Of course, in patients transferred to ICU, the average time distance between death and death has been reported for seven days.
The recent survey shows that the average time distance between the initial signs of death was 14 days, of course the full range of six to 41 days has been reported.
The Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) has shown that the rate of death was 2.8% of men and 1.7% of women.
The tissue-degradable examinations of lung samples of deceased persons are a result of spreading membrane damage and cell fibromyoxyde structures in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumonia.
The lung image is similar to the lung image with hard respiratory dystrose syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths mentioned in the China National Health Commission report, there is an increase in tropionine or heart attack.
Based on data from the U.S. in March, 89% of people were worse than before suffering from a disease, accessibility of medical resources and social and social status of the region also affect the rate of contamination.
Estimates of infections caused by this disease are variable due to regional differences and cognitive difficulties.
The lower number of minor cases may cause excessive rate of injury.
Of course, the fact that the deaths were the result of the previous deaths may mean that the rate of death and death has been reduced.
Smoking people, compared to non-smoking people, are likely to suffer from 1.4 times severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times need special care or diet. The long-term consequences of this disease have followed concerns.
The “Hung Kong Hospitals Department” report indicates a decrease in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some people recovered from disease and the presence of symptoms of lung injury.
This situation can lead to post-observation syndrome after improvement.
By March 2020, it was uncertain whether the history of the cause of effective and long-term immunity is recovered from this disease.
Immunity, based on other coronavirus behaviour, is tolerated, but in some cases the result of a coronavirus test in people with COVID-19 improved has also been positive.
There is a belief that these cases are caused by infections and not abuse again to infections.
The imagination is that this virus is natural and has animal origins, through swelling infection.
True creation is inexplicable, but until December 2019, the spread of this infection was almost completely based on human-in-human transmission.
With a review of 41 first COVID-19 cases, which was published in the Lancet magazine in January 2020, the first case from its release of signs will be restored to December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications have announced the first cases of sign appearance on December 8, 2019.
To detect death and death statistics, it is usually used by different criteria.
These figures vary by area and over time, and affect the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, the time overwhelmed from initial diarrhoea and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO emergency ICD-10 codes U07.1 for death caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory and U07.2 for death caused by COVID-19, including clinical diagnosis or all detection in the detection of time without SARS-CoV-2.
According to John Hubkins University, until April 17, 2020, the global rate of loss was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This number varies in each region. Other measurements can be indicated at the rate of death and death (CFR) that indicates the percentage of people identified as the result of mortality disease. The rate of death and death and death (IFR) is another criterion that determines the percentage of infected people (discovered and not affected)
This statistic is not limited to time and follows a specific population from the infection stage to the closing of the file.
Although all infected people don’t necessarily produce pedants, pedants may provide information about the number of infected people.
In the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, 80 tonnes (1.7%) were deposited in the countryside of Castiglione d'Adda.
In Gangelt, this disease was caused by the Carnival Festivals. contamination of young people caused the rate of death and death to be relatively lower. Certain cases of death caused by COVID-19 were not officially placed in the category of death due to the virus.
Meanwhile, the German health system has maintained its effectiveness.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people, based on blood donors’ estimates, may have produced vagina.
69 cases (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed by COVID-19.
The effect of this phenomenon and its rate of injury is different between women and men.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the rate of death and death has been announced in higher men.
The highest chance of disease in men over 50 years of age is. This breakthrough between women and men at the age of 90 will disappear.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The reasons for this sexual difference are not clear, but genetic and behaviour factors may affect it.
Gender-based cognitive immune differences, less spread of smoking among women, and more male abstracts to same diseases such as blood pressure, in lower ages than women may play a role in rising infestation rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were dead.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did not take any action to address gender-related data in the field of COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as abola, HIV, flu and sarris have different effects on men and women.
The higher percentage of the therapy document, especially nurses, are months and the probability of being exposed to the virus is higher.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that COVID-19 was elected as the official name of the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO CEO, announced that CO name Coronavirus, VI relates to the virus, D Disease Disease and 19 relates to its first identification time: December 31, 2019.
This name is chosen to prevent references to specific geographical locations (such as China), animal species or group of people), based on international nomination proposals and aimed at preventing female labels. The COVID-19 virus, coronavirus 2 is called severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the titles "Covid-19" and "Covid-19" in official communications.
This disease and its factor virus is commonly called the coronary virus.
In the early stages of the spread of the disease in Wuhan, China, the names of the "coronavirus" and "coronavirus" were commonly given to the virus and disease.
In January 2020, the 2019-nCov World Health Organization and the 2019-nCoV Acute respiratory disease considered the names of the disease. These names were chosen under the 2015 Guidelines on the Fear of Gaining the names of the sites for the appointment of the virus and the disease.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to the capacities in the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are taking steps to produce health products such as a cowboy and parts of the machine.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital needed a passenger valve and the supplier could not provide it in time. As a result, a local startup took action to converted engineering and producing 100 night valves.
Following the early stages of COVID-19 spread, theories of coughing, incorrect information and misinformation on the development, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease were formed and quickly published in online space.
This virus appears to be transmitted from humans to some animals.
Studies on finding evidence of the proliferation of the virus in pigs, oxen and chickens did not find any results.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is among government organizations, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization conducted a "unity test" to assess the effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that have the most hopeful.
There are no vaccines yet, but different institutions are actively examining the proposed vaccines.
The previous test results relating to SARS-CoV are used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are used for ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three methods of vaccination are in the hands of research.
First of all, researchers in the construction of the vaccine are complete.
The use of the virus, inactivated or dead, takes place in order to prevent immune reactions in the human body against the new COVID-19 infection.
The second method is followed by sub-unity vaccines, aimed at building a vaccine that can sensitize the immune system against some sub-unities of the virus.
With regard to SARS-CoV-2, this is a S-protein-based research that helps virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is associated with the vaccines of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA vaccines, the new method of vaccination).
Test vaccines for each of these guidelines should be examined in terms of safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine started with the presence of four volunteers in Seattle.
This vaccine contains an unhealthy genetic code that has been copied from the virus. Patent-based development has been introduced as a potential challenge for the development of vaccines for SARS-COV-2 but there is a discussion in this field.
By April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials have been active.
Seven clinical trials have assessed treatments that have previously been approved for the treatment of malaria, including four research plans on hydroxy chloroquine or chloroquine.
Antivirus drugs, including changes in the application, are most Chinese researches that will be announced the result of Phase III testing on remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
Until April 2020, the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccine and suggestive drugs have been tested.The antiviral drug available for COVID-19 treatment is tested, from which can be done to remdesivir, chloroquine and chloroquine hydroxide, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir/tokinavir with tokinavir.
Until March 2020, there was no evidence of the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir without permission.
Phase III clinical trials are in streaming in the United States, China and Italy. Clorokin, which previously worked for malaria treatment, was examined in February 2020 in China and published its preliminary findings.
Of course, researchers have been invited to criticize these results.
Korean and China’s health institutions have proposed the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wohan Virusology Institute, while suggesting a daily intake of a warmth, has announced that the intake of a dose is twice the most dangerous and may be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency intake of hydroxy chloroquine and chloroquine, with the authorisation of the doctors who treated people with COVID-19.In the instructions on the virus 7 of China, the name of interferon, ribavirin or omi phenovir for COVID-19 treatment.
Introductional data indicate that high-dose rubiaurein consumption is essential to prevent the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory environment.
Nitazoid, after its low-blower effect has been proven in retention of SARS-CoV-2, has been proposed for human body research.Results have shown that the preparation of primary spatic protein with the transceiver of transceiver protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine with/without azithromycin has major limitations that have been open to the medical community from acceptance without reviewing these treatments. Oceltamivir is not in the laboratory environment that prevents SARS-CoV-2 reproduction and its role in COVID-19 treatment has not been proven.
Sitoquin storms may be severe from the consequences of the next phase of COVID-19.
The evidence suggests that hydroxychloroxines have the anti-storm characteristics of sitocine. The “National Health Commission” of China tokylizumab has been involved after a short review of the treatment instructions.
After taking this drug in people with severe disease, it was subjected to non-stop testing of Phase 2 at the national level in Italy.
With a combination of serum blood tests for detecting the storm of cytoxin, it works to deal with this development which has been declared the cause of the death of some patients.
The FDA confirmed the antagonist of interferon-6 receptor on the basis of previous studies for the treatment of citonic resilient release syndrome, which was created for another cause, CAR T therapy cells, in 2017.
Until today, random and controlled evidence based on the effectiveness of tocylizumab for CRS treatment has not been provided.
The transfer of clean and bulbs produced in the immune system of people improved from COVID-19 to people needing it as an inactive immunization method is in the hand.
This guide was tested for Sarah, and the results weren't sure.
It is possible that the viral infestation of this process provides the inactivated pathogen-treatment of the field of defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other structures, such as paten-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis, may be effective.
Other types of inactivated therapies, such as the use of artificial monoclonal therapies, are in the hand.
Pure serum production, which includes the blood fluid that is taken from people and has specific infections of this virus in itself, may increase to develop faster.
Diseases caused by coronavirus, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, who died from the central Wawan hospital physicians, who later died of COVID-19 and after public information on the spread of the virus.
