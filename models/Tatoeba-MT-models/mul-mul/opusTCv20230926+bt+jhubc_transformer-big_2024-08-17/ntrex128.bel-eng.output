In addition, the deputy's deputy is overwhelmed by what they look like marijuana.
Some deputies do not understand why their deputy status should be changed to the status of a "member of the Wales parliament".
Deputy members were shocked because of plans to change the local east name to the "Parlement of Wales".
Members of all political opinions believe that this is a matter of fact.
One deputy labourist said that his colleagues were ignored by the fact that it was reassured by the words "during" and "desperate".
For readers outside Wales: In the Russian language twp means "door", and pwp means "defect".
She said her group was not fully satisfied and offered alternatives.
The Wally Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss the change in the name of the east, but noted that it was a short verbal transition from a Wally parliament member to a "Maryman".
In this context, the valley letter w is described as the same as the edition of the English letter u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now developing a draft law on the removal of amendments, made a statement: “The final decision on any description of what the deputies of the East call, of course, will be a question of the members themselves.”
The law of Wales has been entitled to the Valley East to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals, which showed wide support to call the agreement to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the title of an additional deputy, the Commission has given preference to the members of the Wales parliament or the CPU, but the CPU option has received the highest support during public consultations.
Additional deputy, obviously, offer alternative options, but the way to reach consensus can become a headache for senior Eleanor Jones, who is supposed to present the bill on changes for a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as the rules on the dissemination of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the committee system.
Additional deputies will take a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they perform their legislative work.
Macedonians voted on a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, elections voted for the change of their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of solving a long-term issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, the name of their northern neighbourhood is a prevalence in their territory, which has prevented the involvement and friendship of Macedonia in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, a reporter on the name change, said he would not participate in the vote.
But fans of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a cost to be paid for joining the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The Church of St. Martin's Temple is calling for existence.
“At the same time, as the elderly people who talked to me, there was a bar and a church in every corner,” said Adams.
“Today there’s no one or another.”
He said that the bars were clear.
“People have different relationships and relationships now,” he said.
"Because they are no longer invisible local guesthouses where people are going constantly."
As for the church, he hopes that the money from the sale of assets will not be taken for such a long period as the leaders expect, and early or early they will come back from where they started.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by hot ladies with candemics, filled with people who will not help temples staying in the area.
“The majority of residents buying condoms in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that’s why it’s going to speed up the day when these churches close together, because it’s unlikely that the majority of people who are going to go into this condoms.”
The two churches were built by a white community until when Harlem became a black area – the Church of Stalin Graduate in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – in a decade.
The first-century white methodic abstinence occurred in the 1930s.
The black area, which was nearby, had the right to own the building.
The Church of St. Martin was captured by the crowd under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who originalized a bike of traders at the main store in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The fire left the building in 1939 severely damaged, but the returnees under the leadership of Johnson's father planned a restructuring: they introduced the carillon into operation.
David Johnson, the son of John's father and his reborn to the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the Carriel "the poor people."
The expert who played the Carrione in July called it otherwise: "Cultural Treasure" and "A Replaceable Historical Tool".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first in the world to play the cartoonist musician Dianie A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a large cartoon in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Marivesher said he wasn't replaced in the Church of St. Martin.
What happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months was a complicated history between architects and predators, some of which were attracted by the false leaders of the church, others – the epiarchy.
The history of the reverences – the governing authority of the income that consists of the assistants of the capillales – wrote in the epiarchy in July with the perseverance that the epiarchy will “supply to translate expenditure” to the history of the reverences, although the history did not participate in the hiring of architects and advisers.
Some have complained about the absence of transparency on the part of the eparchy.
A 13-year-old boy has been paralyzed during a shooting for a loss of lobbyists in California.
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and paralyzed on the day of the opening of the lobbying season in California.
The attack occurred about 7 a.m. in the morning near the beach of Bacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was engaged in smoking with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy crying out, and then asked for help, and then knocked with the rest to help get him out of the water.
At first, Hamel said that it was just an excitement from the lobbyists, or then he “understanded that something bad happened: ‘I’ve tasted!
I've tasted it!"
"All his keys were broken," said Hamel, adding that he noticed when he went to the boy.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, "In the water near the cake!" added Hamel.
The boy was transported by air to the Ray's baby hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The diversity of the eggs that took place is unknown.
The rescue captain Lara Jailz said on the media browsing that the rabbit was observed in this place a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe diversity.
Jailz added that he suffered from traumas in the upper part of the towel.
The officials closed their approaches to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct investigations and security.
Jailz noted that more than 135 species of eggs live in this area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in universities where the wooden specialists will work.
As part of a significant advancement in the British beauty market with a protection of £2.8 billion of sterling, which continues to grow, while the sales volume of fashion clothing and home goods are lowered as new ladies will be deployed in all other countries, larger beauty houses will be deployed in 11 rooms
Investments in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the place in the police that were previously occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and goods for home.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of beauty products, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which appear for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in corporate departments similar to those that can be found in stores such as Boots.
Large stores also restart their cosmetics Boutique line, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend becomes increasingly demanding among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop's perfume shop will test the concept in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and the second will be opened in Seli Oak (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Buying online and moving to buying small amounts of products every day in local stores near the house leads to the fact that the supermarkets have to do more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that trade points will be increasingly similar to the university, as a network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi, Lidl, with a larger number of services and affordable goods.
Sainsbury's posted Argos trade points in hundreds of stores, as well as posted several pieces of Habitats since two years ago he bought both networks, which, according to him, contributed to the growth of the sale of food products and made more purchases.
The previous attempt of supermarkets to rebuild their beauty departments and pharmacies did not end successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share revenue from pharmacy shops ended after a series of distributions in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business three years ago along with the 281 store Celesio pharmacy owner Lloyds Pharmacy for £125 million.
It was stated that Lloyds played her role in this regard, expanding the assortment of luxurious skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in training our employees who will be able to offer our recommendations.
Our brand assortment has been developed with regard to any needs, and an attractive setting and convenient location makes us a better home of beauty that will resist the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones was shocked after Holly Wilby rejected the sale of £11 million.
The star Dragons Den Peter Jones was shocked after television Holly Willowby rejected the trade of 11 million pounds of sterling with his brand, which specializes in the image of life to focus on its new contracts with I Marks and Spencer.
There is no time for the brand of Truly's home and accessories.
A couple of businesses have become similar to the brand Gwent Petrrow Goop.
This morning, a 37-year-old leader announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowbi has joined the star of Dragon's Den Peter Johns, which is now spreading with his profitable business in creating a brand dress to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Crynics report that Johns was shocked when the "gold" television girl admitted during a tensioned meeting on Tuesday in his headquarters in his business-imperie in Marlow (Bakinghamshyr), that her new transactions would be worth more than 1.5 million pounds.
The business was similar to the Gwent Piltrow Goop brand and was doubled to double Willow's welfare to £11 million sterling.
When the 37-year-old Williambie announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones fled from the UK and headed to one of his homes of rest.
Truly was the main priority of Holly.
This is the long-term future that she will see in a couple of decades.
Its decision to reject all participants has been completely dismissed.
No one wanted to believe what happened on Tuesday, it was very quickly to start lunch.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse, full of goods, ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the leading This Morning, which enters the number of most significant British stars, can cost the company millions due to huge investments in different goods – from airs and candles to wear and domestic goods, as well as from off-roads.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
The three mothers of Williamby and his husband Dan Bolduin were close to John and his wife Tarai Cape for decades.
Willowbi was founded by Truly & Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined the senior position in March.
The pair is resting together, and Jones has a 40-percent share in Boldouin's television company.
Willowbi will be the representative of the M&S brand and replace the daughter of McPartlin as the leading ITV “I – Famousness”.
Yesterday, the source, close to Johns, reported: “We will not comment on his case.”
“When we fell in love with him”
He spoke about the criticism he received from the media for his comments, which are deemed "unpresidential" for what he is positively talking about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump have a lot to reject?
Trump said his paradise “doctoral” votes.
“I don’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced to Trump as a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on the disintegration have taken place.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diploma Li Yin Ho declared the world leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North was unexpected to "conform measures" of the United States in response to the previous step.
Instead, he noted that the U.S. continues to use sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic position in his own direction.
“We are very successfully building relationships with North Korea,” he said.
“It could end the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have brought positive results: completion of missile tests, assistance in the liberation of colonists and the return of American troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"There is very easy to be on the side of the president, but instead of 10,000 people who are trying to penetrate this overwhelmed area, we will already have about 200 people there," Trump said.
The tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have defeated the islands, and hundreds of people have died.
For example, after the earthquake in the lake, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were moved, no national disasters were announced, which is a necessary condition for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was understood that they did not return to international aid, so it was a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
He wants the Children's Creation Fund and gathers a team to travel to Palo until he understands whether foreign employees can work on-site.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Agency for Nature Disasters, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Pola to find out whether an international agency will be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that have always survived Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for unexpected nature.
Although there were homes built in Acheche, there are nearly no other coastal seats.
The obvious lack of cheese to warn about tsunami in Pola led to a large number of victims, although there was warning.
Even in the best time, the movement between the many islands of Indonesia was a complicated task.
The natural disasters have complicated the logistics of the movement.
The hospital vessel, which was placed on Lambok for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake, approaches Pal, but the way to the new place of disaster will take at least three days.
President Joe Vdoda focused on his pre-election company on improving the broken infrastructure of Indonesia and spending money on automotive roads and railroads.
But the lack of funding will be traced by Joe's administration, as the next year will be new elections.
Mr. Joe also faces the pressure of long inter-professional tension in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority accept more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim bands are white on the streets, using marshmallows, firearms and other cold weapons.

The police arrested a 32-year-old man who was suspected of being murdered after the murder of a woman.
The murder investigation was started after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with violent injuries in the Green-M'Uz area on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was suspected of murder.
The police called for people from this area to see or hear anything.

I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers, video registrars who may have taken some videos to contact us, as they can have information that is extremely important for our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Burkenhead and was found in her own house.
Today, a girlfriend came to the place of the accident to ask her where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police said it was in the process of informing the nearest victims.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue became the last centuries-time strike in the case of "rewriting history".
Its removal would be a poetic justice for it, similar to the Taliban's destruction of many cultural and religious objects of England, committed by its fanatic puritan followers.
"But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Cricket's proposal as "dueness" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chief of Cromwell's Board, said: "During the current debates on the demonstration of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's memory next to Westminster Palace will be the subject of these actions.
The British civil wars weren't planned or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell will be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas' actions in the previous century.
The bright presentation of Mr. William Ham Tornicroft about Cromwell is a witness to the thought of the 19th century and a part of the history of an act, which many people think is still to be respected.
The Sunday Telegraph said: "Most people know more since the late nineteenth century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation, subject to long-term historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the mid-17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual cognitive figure representing one of the sides of this confrontation.
His achievement as a lord-deputy also deserves to mark and respect them."
The killer was killed until the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in the southwest of China.
“A man known only by the pronouns – Yuan, was found dead with roasted arthritis and golden blood, near bread on the Lupanshui market in the province of Guyzhov,” the South China Post said on Sunday.
The swine was prepared to introduce the vaccine to the swine on May 30, 2005, in Sinina, China Province of China.
According to the report, he and his red brother arrived on Wednesday from the neighbouring province of Yunan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his brother found him dead and saw the doors in the neighbouring clay open.
He said that there was a large bowl of blood on his chest.
According to the report, the medical researcher confirmed that a 550-kilogramme crop was removed from the farmer.
"My brother's legs were accuracyed and damaged," said a brother from the pronoun Wu (which quoted Guiyang Evening News).
The video from the camera showed that Yuan went to the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found in about an hour.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his brother.
The market leader told Evening News that the consciousness was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the site of the incident.
According to the reports, Yuan family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although the cases when pigs are attacked on people, they are rare, but they have been earlier.
So, in 2016, she was attacked on a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man's serious injury.
Hundreds of years earlier, the weight of £650 was pressed by the Valilian farmer to his tractor and kept it so until his wife left the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Aregon was eaten by his dreams in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood may act as a drop-down shell.
"They're just playful.
They're very busy and very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give him the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remains of the "Rose" hurricane take strong flooding rains in the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecast, the hurricane “Rose” is weaker because it moves over cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, in the next few days, the Roses are taking trails in northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States.
The speed of the rose, 1 category hurricane, amounted to 85 miles/hour in the morning on the east of the sun on Sunday, and it was recorded at 385 miles southwest of Puerto Rico in Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to go to the night on Sunday.
Inter alia, over the Pacific Oceans begins to form a low-pressure area moving eastwards to the western coast of the United States. When on Monday "Rose" approaches the peninsula of Southern California in the form of a tropical storm, it starts
On Monday, the Rose takes up to 10 inches of debris in some parts of Mexico.
Then a tropical moisture that interacts with the adjacent area of low pressure, in the nearest days causes strong left in the southwest.
Places from 1 to 4 inches of debris cause hazardous sudden riots, seawaters and possible debris in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to the fact that the number of places will reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of South Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, particularly in most areas of Arizona, it is expected from 2 to 4 inches of debris.
Due to the grouping of tropical rain areas, a sudden rise may be possible if the conditions are rapidly deteriorating.
It would be very unwanted to walk into the desert due to the possibility of the threat of tropical accidents.
A strong rain may lead to the turning of the walls to the flooding rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by the paradise wind and dust.
The adjacent area of low-pressure leads to strong rain in the part of the coast of Southern California.
Possibly, more than half of the cavity can lead to a slight flow of sweat and make sliding roads.
This will be the first left in the rain season.
Some distributed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and early on Monday before the rain goes all over the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
The strong rain will be spread in the area of four corners on Tuesday and will continue to the seat.
In October there may be strong temperature changes in the United States, as the Arctic becomes cold, but the tropicals remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to low temperature changes in the near future.
There is a good example of low temperature changes in the central part of the U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahai, Nebraska, St. Louis and De Moinham, the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to strengthen and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states of the U.S., a warm October starts from temperatures at 80 degrees – from the Southern Lines to the part of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be approximately 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the United States to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have been watching the hearings of Bret Khawan.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched interesting evidence of witnesses on Thursday in the Court of Justice on the matter between Bretham Café and Christine Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence that occurred in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political opposition continues, broadcasters interrupted their regular programs for the benefit of the extraordinary news on Friday: an agreement, designed by the Horizon Senator Jeff Fleyk for the FBI: it's been difficult to investigate the investigation into you.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she was 100 percent confident that the drunk coffee hid her and tried to pull her out of her dress for a dinner at the elderly school.
Coffee in its pockets said that it was 100% confident that it wasn't.
More than 20,4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have been watching it.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's company typically raises problems with assessing people watching TV in offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in the play-off or Oscar prize.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts have decided to appoint Cavan, has run all networks on average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
“The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC – 2.94 million, the MSNBC – 2.89 million, and the CNN – 2.52 million,” they said in Nielsen.
The curiosity remained high and after hearing.
Flick was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the officials of the dead republican published a statement that he would vote in support of the coffee, he was offended by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protesters cried on his address and when he tried to rise to the elevator in the hearing.
He stood with his eyes absent for a few minutes, when he was loved, and it was broadcast directly on the CNN channel.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” one woman said.
"What do you think he is telling the country the truth?
They said to him, "You have a house, but many women are enslaved to it."
Fleck said his office had published the statement, and reported before the elevator closed, that he had something to say in the hearings in the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks conducted a direct broadcast for several hours, when the Court committee had to vote on the issue of elimination of the Candidature Khavan during the Senate quorum.
But Fleck said he would do this by only understanding that the FBI will dismiss charges against the candidate next week, to what the Democrats are calling for a minority.
Fleck was convicted by the speakers with his friends, Senator-Democracy Criss Kuns.
Following the talks with Cons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have voices to confirm the coffee without investigation.
President Trump began investigating accusations against Khan in the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses criticism of "game in politics" due to Brexit
During the Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics that she plans to leave the European Union that they "play in politics" with the future of Britain and fall national interests.
Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview with her in the first hall of the newspaper was her former foreign minister Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "shaking" brexit plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EC had not had "unique tariffs".
Wade Simpson's murder: Police arrested a murdered LSU player, Dateon Simpson.
The police arrested a deadly shooter in Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the Louisiana University team.
"The 20-year-old Dateon Simpson has been arrested and put in a turmoil for the murder of the second stage," police chief Baton Rouz said.
The officers showed the video about the shooting between Simpson and Simpson, and the police said that Simpson lost the glasses during the shooting.

In the middle of the last season, he scored 5.6 points, 2.6 matches for the game.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at Louisiana University, Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“This is what I always worry about,” said Wade.
The volcano is expelled by poultry in Mexico
The pope, which is exploded by the vulcan Papacatetel, has reached the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Natural Disaster Warning on Saturday suggested Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater appeared and for 24 hours 183 cases of gas and pollen was recorded.
In the center there was a sharp crash and it felt a sharp crash.
The findings on social networks have shown that in Mexico's streets such as Sachimilka, there are thin layers of populist coverage on a vehicle wind sheet.
Geophysicians observed an increase in volcano activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the southeast of the capital after the earthquake magnetized by 7.1 in the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police faced with Catalan separatists on the previous year's independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the supporters of independence faced the police for public security order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration to celebrate the first year of the polarization vote of the Party.
A group of separators in the masks, which were kept by the police for the protection of the public order, left their eggs and flowered in dust color, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later, on the same day, the warriors were excited when the police used their duties to restrain the protesters.
For a couple of hours, the group of fighters for independence, who scandalized “Don’t forget, don’t give,” faced with the present trade unions who shouted “Live Spain”.
According to local press releases, 14 people have been treated by insignificant traumas received during the protest action.
The tension in the region that strives for independence remains high a year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which were marked by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters preferred independence, although a few voters were low, which was significantly interpreted by the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured this year after the police tried to stop voting in election areas across the region as a result of the actions of devastated demonstrations.
Groups who voted for independence spent Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to go another way.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who is present in a separatist defense along with his wife, said he is no longer expecting the prospect of gaining independence in Catalonia.
“We’ve experienced one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite the vital, but small victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who voted for independence, with all their efforts attempted to keep the impulse of the future in order to keep up with many of their most well-known leaders and appeals.
42-year-old mechanic Jean Puch, who records a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was related to politicians from both sides.
“It’s going to be more stressful,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Zhunkereas, one of the nine Catalan leaders in Siza since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“The choice as a candidate for European elections is the best way to judge the ridge of democratic values and repressions we saw from the Government of Spain,” he said.
LONDON: Men have been arrested after they have been arrested in the car
Three men at the ages of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car was once in a house in London.
The incident took place in the Beligard-Cresent area on Thursday around 19:30 p.m.
Detective-inspector Bob Blamings said he had been damaged by the door and the building itself.
Maybe at some point, the car was released.
As a result of the hit of Mango "Livingstan" gains victory over Rangers with number 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mango in favor of Livingstan provides them with victory
Livingstan's success was awarded Rangers, and this was the case to appoint Stephen Gerard after his several performances in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
The hit of Dolly Mango was great, because Gary Holt rose to one level with the "Hibernians" in the second division.
Gerard's team won't win this season on the Premier League exit and next Sunday meets the leaders, the Harts team, which remain on eight points.
To this end, Rangers in Liz Europe receives the Swedish Rapid on Thursday.
"Livingstan," at the time, continued his playless series in the division to six games, and the main coach Holt still feels the parade after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstan" misses chances due to cruel visitors
Holt's team had to warn for a long time before they were killed, but the same direction challenged Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke, but lost his chance to kill at the port, after which Alan Litgov was able to only direct his strengths to meet the attack of Craig Halkett.
The owners were pleased to allow the Rangers to play before them, knowing that they can bother the guest at some point.
That's what the main goal was achieved.
On the side of Rangers, a penalty strike was allowed, and Livingstan was debuting, Dickin Galhacher and Robinson joined to overcome Mengo, who made a passing and killed from the center of the field.
Until that moment, Rangers dominated, but it turned out that the defense of the team was unfair, and the bride of Liam Kelly was virtually uninfluenced.
The same goes on in the second half, although Alfredo Marello really saved Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pitman was rejected by the Rangers' rapper, Alan McGreger, and Lithov departed far from the second seat of Livingstan.
The balls were constantly struck at the port of Livingstan and were rejected, while two demands of the pencil, after Kalket was called to replace Glen Middleton, and the demand for a hand-playing punishment, were rejected.
"Phenomenon" from "Livingstan" - analysis
BBC Scottish journalist Lamant on Arena Tony Macaroni
Fenomenal performance and results for "Livingstan".
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to wait for this exciting trajectory.
Their game style and composition have almost not changed from the moment of their return to the upper hall, but it is worth giving the right Hall for how he stimulated the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a major, building a well-organized defense, while Menga held Conar Goldson and Joe Urala on the ground.
"Renders" didn't get inspired.
No matter what good they were at Jerry, they did not comply with this standard.
In the last match, they did not possess the ball, just once killing the doors, which was something like an alarming call for the Rangers, which were in the middle of the list.
Changed attitude to Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, they saw a smile and felt an irrelevant holiday when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They were discussed because of human rights problems, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdoğan went to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
The city has the largest number of Turkish populations outside of Turkey.
The police were rescued on security measures to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the ball, but many fans gathered closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurdish, also expressed their opinion, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
Protestants reflect the diversity of the guest, which one German Turks declared a hero, and others condemned as an autocratic.
DZ in Depthfard: The rabbit died in confrontation with the car
The rabbit died due to a confrontation with the car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Beautiful Street and Evelyn Street, operating the road in Deptfard, southeast of the city, about 10:15 p.m.
The driver stopped, the doctors arrived, but the man died in the place.
The accident occurred a few months after another rabbit died as a result of a collision on the Childers Street, about a mile from the place of the Saturday accident.
The state police said their employees were working to recognize a person and inform his closest relatives.
At the same time there are road roads and bus stops, and the car drivers were recommended to avoid this area.
Turma "Long-Larchin": Six employees injured during unconditional
"Six officers were injured as a result of injuries in the torment of a strict regime for men," the Penitenciar said.
The unmarried in the Long Larchin tour in Austershare about 09:30 at British time on Sunday and continues to date.
For the fight against the rebels who participate in one wings of eight detained, Tarnada's special group was attracted.
At the site of the attack, the employees were treated with minor traumas.
The representative of the Pennsylvania Service said: "The specially trained turmoil personnel was aimed at fighting those who committed a disrepute in the Long Larchin turmoil."
Six employees were treated after receiving traumas.
We aren't screwing violence in our turmoil, and we understand that the guilty will be transferred to the police and can spend more time in short."
The royal tour "Long Larchin" contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the turma had been treated in the hospital after the attack of the disabled.
In October last year, police officers were forced to deal with serious disturbances during which employees were attacked with balls for the weather.
Hurricane "Rose" threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong hills (which can be useful for dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen at the beginning of next week, because the traces of the "Rose" hurricane remain in the southern part of the desert that pose a risk of sudden invaders.
The National Meteorological Service already published on Monday and Tuesday data on sudden routes in the western Arizona and in the south and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Yuce, Southeast and Jugoslavia, including in the cities of Flink.
It is expected that Rose will go on a straight path through Phoenix, close to rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cycles have brought a tropical storm or under pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles away from the border with the state of Arizona.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts the falling of 2 to 4 inches, while at individual locations level can reach 6 inches in the region of Magnolio in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-western desert, including the central rocky hills and the Great Pool, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual results values can reach 4 inches.
For those who are outside the risks of sudden behavior, the hurricane "Rose" could be prolonged, because their regions suffer from dryness.
Although the behaviour is a very serious problem, some of these are likely to be useful, because in the southwest they are currently watching dryness.
According to data from the U.S. Dry Monitoring Agency, at least more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory experienced the extraordinary dryness of the second category,” weather.com said.
First, the way of the hurricane "Rose" leads to the rising of the Mexican halfway of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rose continued to have the power of hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Ponte Eugene in Mexico, and move north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces cold waters in the Pacific and therefore quiet.
So, it is expected that in Mexico, when the tropical storm arrives, the river's exit will take place from the coast day or evening on Monday.
The falls in various parts of Mexico can be strong, which creates a significant risk of infestation.
"A total number of debris is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northern-western San Francisco, where possible debris to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
"Russia" will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in the morning on Tuesday in the form of a tropical under pressure, which will then continue the movement through Arizona and the southern part of the state of the United States.
"The main danger is expected from Rose or its remains, it is a very powerful rainfall in Lower California and in the northwest of Sanora and the Southwest of the U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden behaviour and rural streams and rainfalls in the mountains.
Assault in Midsameer Norton: Four attempts to end the killers
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old boys were suspected of attempting to murder after finding a 16-year-old body with thousands of violent injuries in Summerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Teresa Excelsier area in Midsameer Northen about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
"The 17-year-old boy and the other two, the 18- and 20-year-old, were arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Summerset," the police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any proof of what happened on their mobile phone to proceed further in their search.
"Cavano is deprived of the power and anger of the Democratic Party," Trump said.
“The vote for the Judge Cavano is a vote for the repeal of the unpleasant and abusive tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a statement in Villing, Eastern Virginia.
Trump stated that Cavanato "defeated the power and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of being elected for post.
Kavano gave evidence before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally rejecting Christian Blaise Ford's accusations that he sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence during the hearings of her accusations.
The President said on Saturday that “the Americans saw this day brilliant, quality and courageous character” Cavano.
"The voice in support of the Court of Justice Kavano is a voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with excellent history of government service," he said.
The president was closely rescued by the election of Kavano, talking about the importance of the Republicans in the period of interim elections.
“Five weeks remained in one of the most important elections of our time.
"I'm not just late, I'm really late," he replied.
That’s why I’m fighting for big candidates everywhere.”
Trump disagrees that Democrats intend to “confront and prevent”.
"It is expected that the first key procession vote at the Senate level on the election of Café will take place no later on Friday," said CNN senior deputy director of parliament.
Hundreds of people died as a result of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of suffered grows
"At least 384 people died, many people disappeared as a result of the flood of giant waves on the beaches, when a huge earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulavay," the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in the city of Pola on Friday, when waves of heights of six feet (18 feet) climb on the beach in the hills, killing many before death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake, 7.5 magnesium occurred in tsunami.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, the people were still on the beaches and did not escape immediately, and they became victims," said in a browsing at Jakarta, a secretary of Sutopo Porovo Nugroho of the Indonesian agency for disaster elimination.
"The cars, red, houses, striking everything around the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km / h (up to 497 miles / h) before striking the coastline.
According to his words, some people survived only because they fell on trees to escape tsunami.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated in the 24 center of Pola.
Aerophotographs, published by the agency of natural disasters, showed that many buildings and stores were broken, the fats crushed and broken, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The following strikes continued to climb the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a region with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Assessment and Usage Technology Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the power of a nuclear bomb ended in Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of tsunami.
Nugroho called the damage "wide" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were broken down.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the breakdowns of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured, and 29 were lost without records.
"Beasts and damage can be larger along the coastline 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palo, a area called Dongal, which is closer to the Earthquake epicentre," Nugroho said.
The relationship with Donghal “was totally damaged,” Nugroh replied.
“There are more than 300,000 people,” said the Red Cross, adding that its employees and volunteers were targeted in the suffering regions.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting tsunami in Paul, but the officials said the waves had come at the time of warning.
In amateur photographs, published on social networks, you can feel as a man on the upper edge of a building with despair calling people on the street warning about the arrival of tsunami.
In a few minutes, the wall of water fell on the shore, slowing down the buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the removed material.
The earthquakes and tsunami caused a serious disconnect of electricity, which caused communications around Pola, so it was difficult for the authorities to remember rescue actions.
According to the authorities, the military began to guide cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but still evacuated with very necessary food and other items of first need.
The airport was only open for help and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joey Vida planned to visit the evacuation center in Palo.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people were lost.
It's very bad.
“While the employees of the World Vision from Donggula successfully gathered to the city of Palo, where the workers hid in the briziant houses located at their two offices, they saw scenes of decreasing on the road,” he said.
"They told me that they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even if the demonstrated aid groups started dark action on the launch of demonstrating aid mechanisms in disasters, some complained that foreign workers possessing profound knowledge prevented travel to Palo.
According to the Indonesian rules, financing, supply and staff outside the border may only begin if the place of disaster is announced as a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a catastrophe at the provincial level,” said Julia Arriani, Indonesian Secretary of the Red Cross.
After the government said, "Well, this is a national disaster," we will be able to open for international assistance, but this status is not yet.
On the second night in Pole, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family disappeared without news, hoped that their nearby miracles would be among those who would leave the immortal historic lines of natural disasters.
The young boy was released from the canalization on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescue officers released a woman who was under the ruins for two days, and near her child's body.
Hendo Subandon, coach of the Indonesian national paraplaner team, prepared two of the missing paraplanes for Asian games that were completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were at the Roa Roa hotel, were his students.
"Being the elder in the field of paraplanerism, I have my own emotional severity," he said.
Mr. Hendon told him how a few hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel was spread among the paraplanerist community, he desperately sent a message to WhatsApp to Palu participants who were on the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked by a grid of glasses, not two blues.
“This means that the messages have not been sent,” he said.
The robbery stole $26,750 while filling bankruptcy in Newport on Levy
"The robbers stole $26,750 to the employee of the Bank, who founded buyers in a bankroll in Newport in Libya," the Newport police department said in a press release.
"The driver of the machine dropped the bankomat in the puzzle complex and was ready to give more money," wrote Denis McCarthy in the release.
As long as he was busy, another man "escape from the Bank's worker" and broke myths with money intended for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses noticed a number of suspects left the place of the incident, but the police did not specify the number of participants of the incident.
Anyone who has personal information must contact Newport police by phone 859-292-3680.
Candy West: Repper changes his name to Ye ("you").
Repper Kane West (Kanye West) changes his name to Ye.
He announced a change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I am officially known as Kayne West.
The 41-year-old West, under the Ye menu, used this menu as a name for his eighth album released in June.
Changes take place before his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the song of Arion Grande for a show that has been resigned for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In contrast to the shortening of his current professional name, West previously said that these words have a religious significance for him.
I believe that "yo" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "yo"," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the name of the album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So, I’m you, I’m you, I’m you, I’m all you, I’m all you.
This came from "Kayne", which means "one", to simply Ye" - a reflection of our good, our evil, our whole loss.
The album is a more reflection of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was differently known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he shared the names of Love and Brother Love.
The former co-worker of West, J.Z., also went without connection and main letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use an army against peacekeepers
Mexican President Andres Manuel López Abdor promised never to use military force against the civilian population, as the country is approaching 50 years from the day of blood repression against students.
On Saturday on the Tlatelolco Plaza Lopez Abradour promised “never use military to invade the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968, the military abstracted a peaceful demonstration on the ground, resulting in the deaths of about 300 people, while the left-wing student movements were wounded throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador has promised to support young Mexicans, granting monthly subsidies to those who learn, opening the most free places in state universities.
"The unemployment and the absence of educational opportunities attract youth to criminal groups," he said.
The U.S. has to double the financing of automotive intelligence
“To the extent that China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount they spend on research in this field,” says an investor and machine intelligence specialist, who is working in Google.
The comments came after the various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the ISIS, even if there is no official ISIS strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, it's trying to be the first in the field of innovation IMO.
“Adding a budget to research in the IA area would be a good start, taking into account that all other countries are leaving the United States, and we are expecting the next break in the IA area,” Lee said.
“Adding funding can double the probability that the next major achievement of the MI will be achieved in the United States,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The State of the Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month, Hooton Miflin Harkurt, is the chief executive director of the company Sinovation Ventures + which invested in the company itself.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie-Melana, he worked on a machine intelligence system, which won the highest-level American player Athlee, and later was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Department of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S.-governmental technological competitions, such as the Agency's robotic competition on a forward research project in the field of defence, and asked if the next will be to help identify the following monitors.
"U.S. researchers often have to work a lot to get government grants," Lee said.
“It’s not China that denies academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired companies from universities to work on IE in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think the green cards should be automatically offered to a candidate in the field of the ISIS," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council released a plan for the development of machine intelligence next generation.
"The National Fund for Environmental Sciences China provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Scientific Fund and other state organizations exert money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China."
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a United Center for Machine Intelligence to participate in the industry and Scientific Wheels, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the agency on a forward research project in the field of protection announced investments of $2 billion under the name AI Next.
As for the National Scientific Organization (NSF), it is currently investing in research of more than $100 million a year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation, which sought to establish a National Intelligence Commission, has not observed actions for several months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted on a referendum to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would allow a decade-long dispute with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that its name of its northern neighbourhood is a prevalence on its territory, and has put a veto on the entry into NATO and E.C.
In June, the two authorities concluded negotiations with the account of the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the bike company raised a question whether voters would meet at least 50 per cent necessary for the referendum.
The question on the vote in the referendum suggests: “You are for membership in NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece.”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the cost to be paid for receipt in bodies such as the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the west of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the epidemic of the European Union, because this means a more safe life for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievska, 79 years old.
Although this is not a mandatory legal force, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
Change of name requires more than two-thirds in the parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no infringement reports had occurred until 1 hour of the day.
However, it was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old electorate in the capital of Scope Joseph Tanevsky.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarza and his son Ducha voted for a referendum dedicated to the change of the country's name, which is the open way for her entry into NATO and the European Union, in Streumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Ahead of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tent set by those who are going to refer to the referendum.
"We are in NATO and the EU, but we want to connect with the upcoming heads, not through the office doors," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we’re a poor country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO friends would take the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I think the majority will be ‘because’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporting the EU and NATO,” Zayev said after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "confirmation of our future."
In a survey, published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, it is estimated that 30 to 43 percent of the voters will participate in the report, which is below the necessary appointment.
Another questionnaire, conducted by the Macedonian television channel, showed 57 percent of respondents who are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they were saying "yes."
For a successful referendum, a man should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure in the report will be the first serious attack on the past government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergei Aguaire from Manchester City goes through all the defence of the British
On Saturday, Sergei Auguster and Rahim Sterling solved the problem with the defence of Britain winning Manchester City with 2:0 at Etihad stage in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Augustus made it easy.
The Argentine attacker received a post in the center of the field.
He called between the three British defenders before striking in the open field.
Then, Agar appeared among the four green cabins.
He walked around one of the defenders and drove a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he jumped on the left side of the flag, finding Sterling.
The English attacking the first touch in the punishment gave the Aguaire ball, who used his right-wing strike to take the "British" brigade by Matty Ryan to the right-wing side of the network.
"Aguare has some problems with the feet," said Pep Guardiola, city head of the city.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have killed the goal at the same time.”
But that's what Sarling gave Sky Blues the first priority in the battle in the Premier League.
This goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguaire received this ball in the depths of the territory of Britain.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flag to Leroy Sane.
Sein made a few decorations before Sterling could reach a distance.
Attacking Sky Blues, he headed the ball into the network before he jumped out of the border.
The City Battle of Hofenheim in the group game of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rain-Nekar-Aren in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercher wants to play the role of the picking points against Rocky
After the Nationals had been excluded from the competitions in the plan, there was no particular reason to launch a new start.
But constantly competitive Shercer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against "Calarade Rocky", but only if there will still be the consequences of the play-off for Rocky, which remain in the leaders after one game with "Los Angeles Dogers".
Years won, at least, a place to win 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even despite the fact that we're playing just like that, at least, we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the storm and other team will be made up so that the game will probably be at the highest level of it all.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start on Sunday, but, as reported, they are willing to give Sherlock the ball in such a situation.
Shercer, who was going to start his 34th start, held a session of the CPZ on Thursday and will be on a regular vacation on Sunday.
Washington 18/07 with 2.53 Euros and 300 cars in 220 2/3 falls this season.
Trump is playing in West Virginia.
The president has been closely rescued to the situation around his election of the Supreme Court, Bret Cavano, speaking of the importance of Republicans in interim elections.
“Everything we have done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
“It’s one of the big, big – I’m not late, but I’m really late, so I’m fighting for big candidates all over,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, see that this is happening now.
And they are fully resolved to return power to themselves, using any necessary means, you see, - submission, measurement.
"They are all the same as those they cover, whom they have to overcome to get power and control, what they want is the power and control that we will not give to them."
According to him, the Democrats intend to “oppose and prevent.”
"And you're seeing this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, subtle, reverse and cruel."
He was rescued to the Senate's court committee for the earlier recognition of Senator of the Democratic Group Diana Feinstein, who received a voice rating from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you let the document go?
Uh, what?
No, I don’t expect – it was a very bad nonverbal language – the worst language I’ve ever seen.”
The work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's an intolerance to those who express their opinions.
When the actors of Momentum in my local party voted for me to hurt, it was a surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of parliamentary members from the Labour Party, who say that we are not welcomed, everything to express our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar contradiction because she resolved antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship explained that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and of the irony of fate are similar issues about which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The meeting, which was held on Friday by the Eastern Labour Party of Nottingham, said that "we want these meetings to be local and productive."
Over the past few years, most of my parliamentary members from the Lebanese party were such meetings on Friday.
Unfortunately, today's most meeting tone isn't so and promised "more good, more soft" policy has long forgotten if really had ever been.
It becomes increasingly evident that in the Labour Party, different views are not allowed, and each measurement is assessed on the one side of the view whether it is beneficial to the party's leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, since colleagues I thought I was sharing the same political views earlier began waiting for me to take a step back, and took positions that I wouldn't agree with the EU - I wouldn't try to deal with.
Every time I speak publicly – and that doesn’t matter what I’m saying – in social networks, there is a turning point in calling for the cancellation of elections, condemning the policy of the center, saying that I’m no longer in the Leipzig Party.
It's not just my experience.
Actually, I know I've been lucky more than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are generally political.
I admire professionalism and resolving those colleagues who face the flow of sexual or racist crimes every day, but are never involved.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is normalization of the level of abuse.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Liberal Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that follows different views, and with every movement of "uncertainty" or changes to the rules of choice the party becomes higher.
Over the past two years, I have given a lot of advice that urged me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then everything will be in order with me.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since then, as I joined Leibarist 32 years ago as a school student, proven by the government of Tetcher, for which my school teacher was legally entitled, I have tried to hold the government's best government services, or we will do it to those who are more than they need.
I've never hid my political views, including the previous elections.
No one in the East Nottingham could be involved in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who struggled for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is heading towards Brexit, which harms the homeowner, the enterprise and our government service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and strength on my backwardness Leader.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, it's willing to be members of the labourist, or not: I'm deceived that I serve you, and I promise that no threat to cancel elections will be a threat to me, and the political purpose will not match you.

Air-Merrowz 38 - 17: Unprecedented air at the top
Two later attempts, possibly, have said a few of the final results, but, without a doubt, Air deserved a trim in this incredibly interesting match of Tennant Premier League.
Now they're starting a tournament table, one side of the ten.
Finally, it was their highest protection, as well as their best chances made by their owners, the trainer Peter Murray had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've still tried our games until now, and we're still inexpensive, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrovez said, "Give the right Aurora, he's worried more than we are."
The 14-minute attempt of Grant Andersen, converted by Frizer Climate, put Ire in front of the plan, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, received for Warriors, allowed Mellorez to sing the numbers, and Jassan Baggot won't escape.
The climate stretched Eira's leadership with a pencil, before, directly in the stop, he killed, and then took a salt trial, making Eira 17-5 in the stop.
But Melrovis well started the second half, and the attempt of Patrick Andersan, converted by Bogota, reduced the retention to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Rhode Noot, which was stretched out, and after the re-start, Air moved further through the test of Stafard McDowell, implemented Climate.
Air, carrying out the duty of Captain Blair McFerson, received a yellow card, and again Melrovis forced another man to pay with the unreasonable attempt of Bruce Colvin at the end of February pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Stroun Hatchinson received a yellow card for the fact that he shot the Climate without a ball from the line of punishment, McFerson dropped behind Air.
Climav realized his attempt to do it again almost after the restart, after Kyle Row received David Armstrong's strike in the penalty and sent the flag of Gregory Henry to the fifth test of the field owners.
Star Still Game, like, ready for a new career in a restaurant business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is going to enter the hospital business industry after it was discovered that it was designated as the director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, plays in the popular BBC show he writes, and is filmed together with a long comedy partner, Greg Hamfilam.
Duet announced that the next nineteenth series will be the last in the show series, and, apparently, Kernan plans to act further after Craigling.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun source suggested that Kernan hopes to participate in the "flowering trade in Glazga".
“Our Sea”: Balivia, which does not have to go to the sea, hopes that the court will open again the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marrakech patrols the Marines' headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In the military-sea bases, from Lake Titicak to Amazon, the devize "Our Sea on the Right" is painted.
Repeat is our duty.
Throughout the Bali, which does not have to go out to the sea, a memory of the coastline lost by Chili in a bloody conflict due to the resource of the 19th century, it is still alive – as is the effort to swim over the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may have reached a maximum in the last decade, as Balivia expects a decision of the international court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Balivia has a impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, she expects a positive outcome,” Bolivian diplomat Robert Kalsdalija said.
Many Bolivians will watch the resolution of the ISS on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court after decades of tension talks will support the Bali statement that Chili is committed to conducting negotiations on the delivery of the Bali to the sovereignty of the Bali.
Eva Marales is a charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces the counterparty struggle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is going to make a decision for Bolivia, and this is little to change even if it does.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no right to make a decision on the territory of Chili and has stated that it will not determine the source of possible negotiations.
The fact that the Constitution of the International Court will come out only six months after the final arguments have been considered is evidence that the matter was "not complicated," said a Chilean expert in international law in Paz Zarate.
In the past four years, it is likely that they've been left behind.
“The requirement for access to the sea was manipulated by the current Bali administration,” said Sarah.
According to her, Marley's warrior lost the remainder of his charity.
Bolivia and Chili will continue to talk, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Since 1962, the two countries haven't been exchanged.
Former President Edward Radreghes Velce, a representative of Balivia in Gaza, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bali will “the exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chili” and the possibility of “the end of 139 years has differed with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calsdaleya also denied that Marales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political force.
"Balvia will never reject its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“It’s the opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea declares that nuclear disintegration will not occur until they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister R. Young Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri was held at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit between leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo, similarly, is located on the border of restoration of nuclear tropical diplomacy with North Korean Kim Chen Yin more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it is a "excessive marrow" to continue the US sanctions and defeat against the declaration of the end of the war in Korea ever put the North on the knee.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Pyongyang doesn't initially take significant steps to uncover.
Kim and President Donald Trump are required to hold a second summit.
But there is a great skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is seriously taking the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompea plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
On the Paris fashion shows, we saw the newest line in massive headquarters on the way to the shop in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or close the sun completely, you can't be searched anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have presented a lot of unusual headcoats for their SS19 collection, which has been waiting for Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was popular with non-practice capsules, designers who sent their creatures to the podium.
Valentino's special rice was a luxurious beige cap, decorated with wide poles, similar to pears that filled the heads of models.
Other accessories of an extraordinarily large size included stunning precious stones of coffee, capturing a magician and even an ananas, but they weren't designed to keep their heads warm.
He also showed the collection of magical masks – just once to Halloween.
Many of the various color masks were with sharp lips and more resembled Ganibal Lector than a high fashion.
One of them resembled a basin for submarine swimming with tubes and protective acrylics, and the other – similar to the paved conus of the frozen.
And if you continue to keep up with the huge features of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who follow the style predict that huge capsules can pass into our daily lives.
The chapels of a large size go five to La Bomba, a salmon chapel with a poles of two feet wide, which can be seen in all, from Riyana to Emily Ratykovsky.
The cult label on a very uncomfortable chapel, which has been dispersed in social networks, has pushed into another large creation in fashion – a salad beach bag, almost as large as a model with this bag, wrapped in a bathtub.
The dark-orange refined bag with raffia accent and covered with white leather handle has become an exceptional part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large chapels and beach bags on main streets next summer, as the designer has shown great impacts, and it would be difficult to ignore the demand for small accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of language is the necessary skills for all citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain achievement in academic success, it continues since 2018 with another excellent outcome of exams, which enhances individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scotland Independent School Council (SCIS) are striving to provide the best level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further higher education, chosen by their careers and their places as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and decorate an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in the language he understands, it remains in his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it's going to his heart."
It's a clear reminder that we can't trust only in English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the last year's exams, we see that languages are taking the first place in the league tables with the highest score indicators in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a higher level of A.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students reached higher class A in Chinese learning, while 72 percent – those who study German, 69 percent – French to English, and 63 percent – English to English.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital life skills, which will certainly need children and youth in the future.
Languages are now chosen as a subject as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons employers led to difficulties when completing vacations, 17 percent were linked to a shortage of language habits.
Therefore, more and more language skills become a need to prepare young people for a future career.
With more prospective jobs that require language knowledge, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of who chooses the profession, when you learn another language, it will be a real advantage in the future if you are voting such skills for your life.
The ability to contact people from other countries automatically put a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to a YouGov survey, in which more than 4,000 adult British were involved in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language, and French was the only language to speak twice as much as 15 percent.
This is why investment in language learning is important for modern children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, gives children more chances to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school will vary in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking at the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, in independent schools, there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching complex that is a specialist in this field.
Scotland's independent schools will endeavour to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and arme them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what will be in the future.
Currently, it is not possible to deny that in a global business environment languages are still of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Actually, modern languages should be considered as “the skills of international relations”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference for young people in Scotland.
This should be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Independent School Council
Lebron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
The start of the waiting for fans who want to see Lebrone James made his first start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of Lakeers, announced that James was playing at the pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it's going to be, it's still going to be.
"This will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Truwell wrote that James is likely to play in a limited minute.
According to the practice that took place this week, James asked him about his plans for "the behavior of the game's pre-season schedules."
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump starts many of the company's shares.
This is the first of the five planned Trump's speeches next week, including stops in Friends, Tennessee and Mississippi.
After confirming voting on the arrival of the elections to complete the vacation of the Supreme Court, Trump strives to strengthen the support of those having to take place interim elections, as Republicans are at risk to lose control over Congress.
When Trump's speech begins tonight in West Virginia and how to look at it on the internet?
Trump's speech in Willing (Western Virginia), scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia on the Internet below on a direct YouTube channel.
Trump, sooner than all, will dismiss hearings on candidates this week to the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano, who has problems with the occasion of sexual charges with the expected confirmation in the Senate voting for a week during the investigation.
But the main objective of these speeches is to provide assistance to the Republicans who will stand before the election in November.
Thus, President Trump's company announced that these five speeches were aimed at "activating the activity of volunteers and fans, as Republicans are trying to defend and expand to the majority of the people they have in the Senate".
“The control of Congress is so important for him on the agenda that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states as we are entering the stressed season of the pre-election company,” said Reuters, Trump’s representative.
Planned on the Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, today's action can attract fans from Agua and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh,” reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visited West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to assist the candidate in the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the interviews.
“This is not a very good sign for Morris that the president has to come to try to give him a shot in the interviews,” said Simon Hedar, a police officer from the University of Western Virginia, Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team is moving forward to fight to preserve hope for life on Sunday
After three single sessions on Saturday, it was probably exactly what Rider Cup needed for this.
The impulse that appears to be a completely conceived sporting concept, in which players are strong to believe, and a little greater than similar competitions.
Where would they say the impulse now?
"They had the advantage of six points, and now four, so I think we're going through this with a small impulse," said Jordan Sleepy, splitting over the day.
The advantage of Europe, of course, is for four points forward, and in the game there are twelve more.
The Americans, as Speech says, feel that in their lightly falling the wind, and they have something to hope, not in the end, because of the form of Salvation and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and everyone can boast three points.
The rescue was deadly from the shirt to the green and is an example.
These garbage crows of celebration became increasingly sound as long as his round extended, and he took a decisive hit to play in the four field matches when they played two to two with Thomas.
His strike, which allowed them to win in the 15th match, was encountered with such cries, such as what he tells you that he thinks the American team is not excluded.
“You just need to deepen and care about your own game,” Spici said.
All of these players have gone away.
18 to make a sign.
In the last two days, the only players who purchased more points than Spider-Man and Thomas were Francesco Malinaria and Tommy Flitwood, the unprecedented history of the Redder Cup.
Strange, but magical couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything bad.
"Malwood" was the only parade that did not make gods on Saturday, on the other half of the day, but they also escaped gods on Saturday morning, on Friday and on the other half of the day on Friday.
This is happening, and how their energy, like, runs to this fierce flood and from it, and this confirms that they are players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close the national golf course, or a potential victory in Europe.
Both are desired at the same time in different locations.
The talk of the European fame remains a temporary.
Bob Watson and Web Simpson made a short job on Sergei Garcia, the hero of the former furshetti when he was a couple with Alex Norran.
The gods and two twins in the previous nine have thrown a Spanish and Swedish with which they couldn't get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your moon.
During the matches of four balls and four so interesting to watch carefully because of the interaction between the complex couple, the order they give, the order they do not perform, and how the strategy can change at the same time.
Europe has yet to become the best team and has played a significant role in the last day, but this fourth session also shows that the U.S. team is striving to fight, in which some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe is coming to the Rider Cup with number 10-6
Europe will get a good favour in the last day of Ryder Cup after he comes out of the Saturday matches of four balls and four games with 10-6 advantages over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fletwood's duet and France's Malinare, they pointed out a fight against two victorys over Tiger Woods to boost the results in Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Burn, trying to keep the traffic they played in Hazeltin two years ago, reiterated in the U.S. agency injury in the morning, receiving the 3-1 series.
The U.S. proposed more opposition in four ball matches, winning two matches, but they couldn't do much more.
In order to keep traffic, Jim Furrick's side needs eight points from 12 single matches on Sunday.
Flitwood is the first European beginner to win four matches, and he and Malinari who received the name Molliwood after sensational outputs – it is only the second couple who won four points for his first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Rid in four balls, they were wonderfully engaged to defeat Woods and the American Naval Brayson Decab another 5 and 4.
Woods, who played himself after two matches on Saturday, showed random flash flash, but now he lost 19 out of 29 in four balls and four and seven matches.
Justin Rousseau, who had scored six matches of four balls, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the matches of four balls at the 2 & 1 Destiny Johnson and Brooks Koepki – takes one and the other place in the world.
Europe didn't have its way, although it was nice, a fresh day to the east of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time winner Jordan Space and Justin Thomas set a control point for the Americans in two points.
They earned 2 and 1 victory over John Rome and Ann Pulterer from Spain in four ball matches and returned later to win Pauler and Rory Michaelroy 4 and 3 in the fourths, losing two distances.
Only twice in the history of the Cup Ryder team returned from a shortage of four points that goes alone, although with the owners of Furrick just need to paint to keep traffic.
However, after the next two days, the constraint looks like it's going to happen on Sunday.
North Korea says "not in any way" will be disarmad in a side-by-side order without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday the United Nations will continue sanctions that reinforce unfairness to the United States, and under such conditions the country cannot reject nuclear weapons in a single order.
Ry Yun Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organ that last year North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will", for example, the stop testing on nuclear and missile areas, the demonization of nuclear test zone and the promise of not spreading.
“We don’t see the corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to disarma ourselves first in a side-by-side order.
Despite the fact that Ri republiced the usual North Korean complaints against Washington to the "phase" approach to dienuclearization, within which North Korea was awarded award-winning debt to the extent that it had taken step-by-step steps, its intention.
Ri rescued himself for a joint statement by Kim Chon Yin and Donald Trump on the first in history at the summit of President of the United States and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the way to "denouncing the South Korean Peninsula".
North Korea is trying to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States said Pyongyang should first reject nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call for abolition of stringent international sanctions regarding North Korea.
"The United States initially insists on "denuclearization" and increased pressure levels by means of sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced way, and even oppose the "announcement of the end of the war", said Ri.
"Recognition of what sanctions can put us on the knees is an inconvenience of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the penalty continues to deepen our lack of faith."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. chief celebrated earlier this week in the United Nations Organization.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moun Jian over the past five months and added: "If the participants of this question about the denuclearization of South Korea were the South Koreans, not the U.S.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri Cuckle speech differed from last year when he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly stated that the nazi on the U.S. continent using North Korea missiles was inevitable after the "Minister of the President of the Bad" Trump's name
This year in the U.N. Trump, who had threatened to "destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking dismissal measures, but said that there would be much more to do, and the sanctions should remain in force until that day.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter."
China and Russia are discussing in the United Nations, the Security Council said that Pyongyang should be awarded for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the Sanctions of the Security Council should be active and mandatoryly continued until we have confidence in the full, final and correct order."
The Security Council reinforced sanctions regarding North Korea in 2006, trying to stop funding of Pyongyang nuclear and political missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the calls of the Security Council. The General Assembly then stated that he will visit Pyongyang again in the next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn't successful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, stating that the progress, achieved with North Korea for several hours of talks, ended with a visa statement that he represents the demands "only for the gangsters".
At a meeting with Muhammed this month, North Korea promised to eliminate the missile installation and nuclear complex when the United States will take "compliant measures".
Trump said, according to Kim’s “conform measures” he expects is a security guarantee and an effort to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Students of Harvard are taking the course for the right rest.
The new course of Harvard University this year must train students to sleep more, and is aimed at fighting culture learning at night with coffee in hand.
Scientists came to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chasler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the hospital named Brigma and a female hospital, developed a course that, in his opinion, was the first to be born in the United States.
Inspired by the expression of the lack of sleep on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lesson, one girl came to me and said, “Why did you tell me this only right now, at the last course of training?”
"She told her that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - that surprised me," he said.
For the first time this year, the course, taught by students, explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievements, as well as improve the overall mood.
Paul Barry, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Service, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students were often invited to sleep.
A course that lasts for an hour includes a number of interactive tasks.
One part is the appearance of a room on the internet, where students press on cups of coffee, fireplaces and books that tell about the impact of cafe and light and how a lack of sleep affects sports indicators, as well as the importance of the habit before bed.
At an intense stage, participants are told how many years of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive pictures, invites participants to think about their daily lives.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have to know this as well as everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health,” said Cheeseler.
According to his words, the culture of night dinner continues to exist, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students lead to the fulfillment of sleep, which becomes increasingly a problem.
"Assured enough sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight against stress, elimination and tremor," he said, "even to avoid excessive weight, as careful sleep makes the brain constantly headaches."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chessler to develop a course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to watch everyone on the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be the request for all Assyrians to complete a similar learning program before graduating in the university.
Professor Cheeseler recommended the student's ability to install a watch to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful consequences of "blue light", which radiates from monitor screens and LED lights that can change the impact of the switch
Livingstan 1:0 Rangers: Mega kills Gerard's goal.
Rangers suffered another parasite when Dolly Mango's goal convinced that Stephen Gerard would not get parasite 1:0 at the stadium of Livingston.
Eibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to a triomphe with number 4-1 in February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holtan's team already brings the second parade of Gerard as a manager from 18 games to leave the Ladger on his side from eight points.
Menga hit seven minutes before the stop, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, didn't seem to have a parasite.
At the same time as Rangers descends to sixth place, Livingstan took up to third place, while behind Himbernians remain with the differences in the balls.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after as Columbus Spence's forehead should be treated with head trauma after his type of item was shot out of the tribulation.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, because Iro didn't play in the semi-final Battlefield Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under 11 numbers, which allowed to take a point from Hearts last week, and was amazed at how well they went through every step of their opponents.
Rangers were more possessed by the ball, but Livingstan did more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to kill in two minutes, when Menghi first guided the ball through Scott Pitman to the doors of Alan McGreger, and then the half-defender used this opportunity.
Successful punishment of Jacobs Kegan has been recorded by Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Litgov was able to bring a strong strike backwards.
Rangers took control, but in the last third of the games were more likely to kill than demonstrated a good game.
Alfred Marelas had to be punished for a quarter of an hour before the end, when he and Steven Lawless met on the ground, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the complaint of Colombia.
Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but former broker Ibrox Liam Kelly barely gave the goal to Lisan Kuliballi and the effective attack on this Acharia.
Although killing the first goal in the 34th minute, Liva may have been against the next active game, but no one refuses to demonstrate a good game to the prisoners.
Again, Raymonds couldn't try the door of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declane Galhacher gave Scott Robinson a passing, who blocked Mengo to get the chance to kill at the port.
Jerry replaced Kulibali's stop with Ryan Kent, and this showed an effective effect when the attack went to Marellas, but the angry Kelly fled and blocked the attack.
But Livingstan continued to enjoy the visitors, playing the game they liked, and Litgov and Halkett continued to share the ball after a long opposition.
Bock Holt was able to overcome only in the last few minutes, but McGregar played well to resist Jacobs before Litghav went to the stock market.
Render's replacement by Glenn Middleton occurred once after the penalty, when he met James, but Tomson managed to get rid of it.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's account.
The page of our German "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLIC... the day of the future physicist Ihan Wilhelm Hans Heiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in the appearance of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Heager's counter became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Zwanna Karanad", in which they participated, would seem to be known by the famous scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
"Who is he on earth?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger's counter, which is used to search radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put your headphones, you have the ability to hear the sounds of the atoms that give radioactivity in minerals."
Eve: “Tell me, isn’t it really going to be right now?”
Hans Hayger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the inventions that bear its name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system "see" cancer cells.
The new anti-inflammatory vaccine can help the immune system "see" bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine is like learning the immune system to detect bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method predicts obtaining immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then cells can "see" whites, spread into many cancer cells, and then reintroduce help cells.
The test vaccine will show successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
A woman introduced a vaccine that helps the immune system detect cancer cells saw that ovarian cancer disappeared for 18 months.
The method includes obtaining immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" HER2 whites, common for many cancer cells, and then reintroduced.
About this, Professor J. Berzofsky from the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland. Our findings show that there is a very prospective vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of antropic cells that struggle against cancer of the small colon, ovaries, light and thick cats," said Professor Berazofsky.
Such an approach to the detection of immune cells in patients and their "teaching" to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukosis.
Kanye West joined the debate in support of Trump, carrying the title of the MAG, after his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't go well.
In the studio during Saturday evening, Kanye West was cancelled after his speech, where he was wailing the United States. President Donald Trump said he was going to play for the second term in 2020.
After the evening of his third song called "City of Privid", when he was in the "Making America Again Great", he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to the whites, and they say, 'How can you support Trump, he's racist?"
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began the show with the main role of Meet Daman, where the Hollywood star was excited over the indications of Bret Cavano in front of the Senate's court committee while considering the case on the sexual abuse of Christina Blaise Ford.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, the words of West were posted in the picture and were uploaded into social media comics Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rok was trying to get rid of West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the balls.
They've been pushing me back to the balls.
They said, “Don’t get out of this cake.
They've been ashamed of me.
"And then they say I'm in a damn place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: Do you want to see a glacier place? "Tell him that he's" trusted my Scrapman, which meant that he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try to love.
Due to his statements at least twice the hearing was cancelled, and the representatives of the SNS rejected a message from Veraiti. "The whole studio ordered."
West was adopted as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boy, reper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many of the songs I love it in the water bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the CEO of the TPUSA Conservative Party, Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the most courageous spirits Thank you for your support.”
But the leader of the streams, Karen Hunter, wrote that the West is just the one he is, and it's always wonderful.
"But I decided not to reward anyone by purchasing his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art", which I consider, covers and disregards the ideology that hurts my society.
He's free.
As we are,” she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "officially hanging by Kane West."
He isn't the first artist to change his name, and went to the tracks of Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy.
His colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and, of course, a legend of music that changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, formerly known as Prince.

Kit Harington is known for his sword and role of John Snow in the "Gulny seats" series in the baweway of medieval HBO raw material
But the 31-year-old actor received a stereotype of the hero Macho, which means that young boys often feel harder to respect.

HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in cases by 14%
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and HIV has increased by 14%.
According to healthcare workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were recorded.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, as was in the past.
Traditional HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfer.
"But the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfers has decreased almost to zero," Chinese officials said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases to 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV infections through sex is an acute problem of LGBT partners in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to LGBT people still exists.
Due to the conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married to women.
Many diseases are spread by insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to resolve this global problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the data, disadvantages and the theory of the agreements by her parliamentary employees
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters filed charges on Saturday that her employee put personal information on three U.S. Senators-Republicans on Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles stated that there are pretensions to the participants of the top-right wing and their websites.
"It's crazy, crazy, and a lot of bad luck," said Walters on Twitter.
Published information, as reported, includes home addresses and telephone numbers in the United States. Sans. Lindsey Gram from Southern Queen and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during hearings of the Senate Commission on Sexual Prosecutions in relation to a member of the Supreme Court, Bret Cavano, appeared on Thursday on the Internet.
A few days later, three of the officers asked Cavanato.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source IP address was linked to the Waters office and was disclosed by Waters team employees,” Hill said.
“This unreasonable affirmation is totally false and totally miserable,” Watters continued.
“A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security have been postponed as a result of these searches and false accusations, in no case he has been liable for the withdrawal of this information.
This unreasonable affirmation is totally false and totally misleading.”
Waters' statement promptly called for criticism on the Internet, including from the former White House Secretary of State Ari Fleicher.
“This denial causes anger,” Fleicher wrote.
This shows that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone is accused of not doing it, they shouldn't be defeated.
They don't have to be ashamed of themselves.
They shouldn't be in doubt about their accusations.
They have to be calm and comfortable.
Fleicher compared the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats to the judge Cavano, when they were accused of being too crushed during the hearings on Thursday.
Amar Nawar, a candidate of the Republican Party, who is engaged and participating in interim elections, has also spoken on Twitter.
“This is a resonance if it is true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Walters stated that her office has warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false statements.
“We guarantee that the blame will be found,” she continued, “and they take legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for any of my team’s employees.”
Johnny's English Strikes Again hits the invented spion of Rowen Atkinson.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BEXIT in any new film with British ears, and this ear seems to have been in comedy and ex-franchise Johnny Ingliss, which started in 2003 with Johnny Ingliss, and John was forwarded in 2011.
Is it possible to make a good sense of how obviously we look when we are talking about new opportunities for exports?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, uncompetitive Johnny Inglisch had the opportunity to talk over things - his name was more loud than all the comic creatures he did for not English spectators in the film.
It is known that he is a secret agent, who, despite his intelligent predecessor of glamour, has become somewhat similar to Kluso with Mr. Bine's rice and somewhat such a guy who has given the only note in Hor Fire at the 2012 ceremony at the opening of the Olympics.
Originally, his character was based on the landscapes and international mysteries of Atkins, who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving the chaos on his way.
There are a few moments that haven't been before.
I loved Johnny Anglish, who is approaching the helicopter, wrapped in the Middle Ages, and the rotor's hills are slightly pulled up on his shoulder.
At Atkinson for theatre comedy light is demonstrated, but humanity feels weak, and therefore surprisingly when serious films such as Agent 007: Mission is unexpected surely offering comedy as a mainly partial.
Humor feels like it's not just for adults, but also for children, and even the unemployed accidents of Johnny Ingliss are not as inventive as the mosquito movies of Atkins in itself.
A long-term development is a serious problem for the United Kingdom.
Cyber-hacker has penetrated the super-secret community of British spys in the UK, discovering the names of all British agents on the spot, to the disappointment of the deputy agent – this is, unfortunately, the small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, which is a shameful and mixed acter who has already suffered from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything possible with this quasse-Terezai-May, but in the scenario there is nothing like that.
Her intelligence advisers report that since every real spy will be disclosed, she will have to take part in some of those who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny England himself it's all complicated: now he's working as a sixth teacher in several difficult institutions and gives lessons how to be unprecedented operators: some good examples here, because English offers the Academy of Music.
England returned to Whitehall for an extraordinary browsing and joined his ex-year-old friend Bo, who plays again Ben Miller.
At the moment, because I have a marriage, bound to the commander of a submarine boat, whose role Vicky Pepperdin performed a little unfairly.
That's how Batman and Robin get badly wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they're working again, encountering a beautiful woman Volga Kurilenka.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous order of a charismatic technical billionaire that claims that it can solve problems with the hackers of the United Kingdom: with the deceased Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Ingliss and Boo start their excuses with immediate things: shattering under the officer, inflicting French restaurant; creating a pogrom, fighting counterbands on board the luxurious yacht of Volta; Ingliss'rame will be able to stop the home clean anarchy, because he will try hard to get rid of it.
All the moments are drawn for the last event, but are equally pleasant and noisy, which have a lot of children on television.
Very good material.
And with the other films about Johnny England I couldn't think: can't the British filmmaker give Rowan Atkinsane a role that really shows his talent?
The Leipzig Party rejects the development of a plan to pay the British for a four-day working week with payments within five days.
Jeremy Corbin's working party should consider a radical plan if British work only four days a week, but pay them for five.
As stated, the party wants the leaders of the companies to give the results of the work done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an additional day of exit.
It was clear that the employees of the future enjoyed the three-day expenditure, but they will still get the same wages.
The idea is consistent with the economic programme of the party and plans to target the country to support workers.
The trade unions have approved the transition to the four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
The oldest source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “The planned review of the actions will be announced by the end of the year.
This is not happening right now, but a four-day working week is an idea that corresponds to the views of the party and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Leipzig Party is not the first to approve this idea, the Green Party promises to hold a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the efforts of the Leipzig Party are not fully supported.
The representative of the Leybarist Party said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy target, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonald's last week's work conference to express his vision of a social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald's said he decided to return authority from "unpleasant directors" and "manners" to municipal enterprises.
The Chief Chancellor's plans also predict that current water resource shareholders may not get back the entire package of shares, as the government of Lebarist can make a "high" on the basis of measured infringements.
He also confirmed that it is planned to incorporate employees into the boards of companies and establish joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the private company's own funds to employees who will hold annual dividends of up to £500 sterling.
Lindsey Gram, John Kennedy told for "60 minutes" that after the FBI working with Cavano, the FBI has to change its opinion
The FBI's investigation into prosecutions in relation to the judge of Breta Cavano resigned to the final vote on his election to the Supreme Court at least a week. The question arises whether the office of the Republican Senates will be able to respond to the conclusions of the Senate
In an interview on Sunday, the "60 minutes" journalist Scott Pauly asked republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about "Sens": whether the FBI can reveal anything that can lead to changes.
Kenya seemed to be more open than his friend from the Southern Queen.
“I’m in mind, of course,” Kenya said.
"I said, going to the court meeting: I talked to the judge Cavano.
I called him after this happened, and asked him about the cause of the accusation, saying, "Did you do this?"
He was a decision-maker and a determinant.”
Grammy, however, seems to be final.
“I think Bret Cavano has decided that this will be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that: Bret's denied that," Grem added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“Everybody that she calls was unable to believe.
He was only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the International Festival in New York takes place: An annual musical event, which has a very tangible composition of speakers and performers and has a mission to stop poverty in the world.
Now, over the course of seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will be held on the big corner of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes in the year 2030, as well as to learn about the real goal.
The International Citizenship Festival, which appeared in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Project against the International Promotion Group, which hopes to stop poverty on account of increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay VIP ticket) visitors have to perform a number of tasks or "make an action", be the fans, send an email to the country's leader, call anybody else
But how successful was the civilian festival for 12 years and could he achieve his goal?
Is the idea of awarding people a free-cost concert in a real way to convince people of the need for active actions, or is this just another case of so-called “click-wise” – people feel that they do a good business by signing online?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival say they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their fans who are trying to achieve different goals.
It is said that these actions have contributed to strengthening influential leaders to carrying out their commitments to more than $37 billion, which may affect life to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 comments on commitments and claims to at least $10 billion that have already been allocated or collected.
According to the estimates, the funds provided so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include supply of food, partnerships with investors and executives based in the UK, "aid children to develop in the 4th century by getting more than 700 games in full", promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can cause social injustice in history," said Ambassador Trey Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 shares have been conducted, calling to improve nutrition for mature and children, the government has announced the financing of a "food aid project" that reaches about 5 million foods.
In response to one of the most common questions on the website, "What makes you think that we can end poverty?"
The Global Festival responded: "This will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will suffer the parade and the right.
But, as well as big civil rights and movements against the apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janet Monae are one of the number of parsons who are attending the event this year in New York, which will take Debar-Ley Fernness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use Navy for "blocking" to prevent Russian oil and gas exports
"Wishington may, if necessary, address the military-naval fleet to prevent the outlet of Russian energy on the EU and the Middle East market," US Secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner said.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it acts on the invitation of a legal government, are the basis for the study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy as much as in Eastern Europe and South Europe," he said.
And, according to the law, there are ways and ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to secure the openness of maritime fires by means of the Navy fleet, and if necessary, to organize the blockade so that their energy will probably not hit the market," he said.
Zhinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Allied Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-commercial group that positions itself as a "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less equivalent and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia a "one-sided country" with an economy that depends on the exhausted fuel.
These statements emerged when Trump's administration wants to significantly increase exports of its natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
For this, workers of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "unlawful" gas project "North Flow 2", which, according to Trump, transformed Berlin into "Palone" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the "North Flow 2" gas pipeline costs 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
Crimea argues that Washington's strict position of this project is starting in the economy and is an example of uncertain competition.
"I think we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Mask in Fisheries Very
The Americans have received a strike in response to Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
The main German organization representing the industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) urged the U.S. not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dr. Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Pouldi Angela Merkel and Prime Minister.
Elizabeth Warren is going to be very serious about his participation in the 2020 presidential elections, the Senate from the state of Massachusetts said.
The Senate of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would seriously consider his participation in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
During the talks at the Massachusetts City Halloke, Warren confirmed that he considered the possibility of his participation.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and advise our unreliable government, and I’m also talking about women at the highest positions,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will consider the possibility of being a president.”
During the speech at the Mayor of Warren, President Donald Trump said he would "lease the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m very upset about what Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano.
On Friday, Warren wrote in his tweet, “Of course, before the vote it is necessary for the FBI to conduct an investigation.”
However, the results of the survey, published on Thursday, showed that the majority of the voters of Warren do not think it should be awarded to the president in 2020.
According to a survey of the Center for Political Research at Saffolk/Bostan Globe University, eighty-five percent of the "possible" voters of Masachusetts said that the Senate should not be dismissed.
Thirty-two percent support its decision.
The survey showed a large support for former Governor Dave Patrick, where 38 percent were for and 48 percent against.
The other famous names among Democrats discussed in connection with the potential ballot in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Bayden and Senator from the state of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Baden said he would officially make a decision by January.
In support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic Trek Palin syndrome
The 26-year-old Trek Pollin spent a year in Iraq after calling for service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"That's what my son passes after the return, I can compare with the results of the random syndrome and injuries with which our salads return to other families," she said in support of Donald Trump in Tallinn.
Pauline called this riot “a major question” and said that her son, along with other veterans of war, “returns a little more, excited, returns to the question of whether there is the respect for which the sultans, the flyers, other military countries have struggled.”

18 states and districts of Colombia support the depreciation of a new policy on the delivery of refugees
Twelve states and surrounding Colombia support the oppression of a new U.S. policy, which rejects the victims of the strike on the side of the band or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts of Colombia put an analytical record on Friday in Washington to support the repression of the policy on the delivery of the airport, NBC News said.
The full name of the truth in the case of Grace against Sessions, which was opened in August by the American Union for Civil Rights against Federal Policy, was not disclosed.

She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers of State supporting Grays described Salvador, Guadeloupe and Guadeloupe, with the highest number of requests for refugees in the United States as countries having serious problems with bandits and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy changed the 2014 immigration appeal commission decision, which allowed immigrants without documents that were victims of domestic violence to return to the refugee.
Attorney General of Columbia, Carl Rayin, said on Friday that the new policy "ignore decades of the legal experience of states, countries and the world."
“Federal law requires the application for the port to be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and a similar change violates this principle,” the analyst said.
Attorneys also said in a statement that the policy that denies immigrants deteriorates the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "create the necessary jobs."
Attorney General Jeff Seshns ordered in June judges on immigration to no longer give refugee victims of domestic violence and violence from the bands.
"The opportunity is given to those who leave their country for persecutions or fears based on races, religions, nationalities or belongings to a social group or political views," Sean said on June 11, announcing this policy.
The problem has never been solved, even all the serious problems faced by people around the world every day.

I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threat" using "propaganda advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page advertising in the U.S. newspaper, exploring mutual benefits of American-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of excitement in Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump has mentioned a paid addition to China Daily to Des Moines Register – the best-selling gas station in the State of Aviation – after the accused of China in attempting to participate in the election in the US Congress on November 6. This is an announcement.
Trump's accusation that China has tried to join the U.S. elections has noted that U.S. officials have named a new phase in Reuters in the Washington press company in China.
While the placement of the advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have uncovered a trade war resulting in the mutual imposing tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts said, have been introduced to harm exporters such as entrepreneurs from the State of Aviv who support the Republican Trump party.
The US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branded wrote in the author's Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, "now doubles its efforts by printing the promotional advertising in our free press."
“Resoluting its promotion, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, printing the paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Brentstead wrote.
"And if you look at the newspapers in Beijing, then you will find there not so many voices against and you will not see a real reflection of other measures that Chinese may have about a dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the pressure."
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers rejected the proposal" to print his article, although he did not call this newspaper.
Republicans restrain women-electors in advance of interim elections from Finland Cavano, warn analysts
While many well-known Republicans are defending the candidate for the position of Supreme Judge Breta Cavano in front of several charges of sexual rape, analysts have warned that they are getting a hit in response, especially from women during future intercourse.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most Republicans already show that they are ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be returned," said Grant Richer, a professor of political sciences at the School of Maxwell of Siracusa University of the edition "The Hill" for the article. which was printed on Saturday.
The spokesman said it wasn't sure that Senator Jeff Fleck (Arizona)'s statements on the FBI's investigation would be enough to refresh the dismantled voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national prime minister of the MoveOn Progressive Group.
On Friday morning, protesters scandalized the "List of Fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall, when Republicans who control the legal committee decided to issue Cavano candidature despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blake, Mi Fordy
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be extremely big,” said Stu Rottenberg to the news site, an independent political analyst.
“People say they’re high, and that’s true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women-electors in prizes and young electors aged 18 to 29 years, who even do not like the president, but often do not vote."
Even before an open statement, Ford, in which she detailedly filed her candidate's accusations of sexual violence in the Supreme Court, analysts believe that if Republicans are to insist on confirmations, there may be a strong strike of response.
“For the Republican Party, this has become a resident,” said Michael Still, the former leader of the National Committee of the Republican Party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The talk is not about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether it will strike Kavano in the position. The talk is about how Republicans have done this and how they have made it to her," observed the news channel Gay Sessel. The director of the group,Priori
However, it's like the Americans were split into the matter of Ford or Cavanate, which is a bit more popular than the last one.
A new questionnaire from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the recipients are probably or not very certain, and 35 percent said that they are probably or not very certain, Cavano.
In addition to this, 38 percent said that, according to their estimates, the coffee might or probably have been deceived in their statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After a strike on the side of Fleck, the FBI will investigate the accusations on the side of Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate's Legal Committee that Cavano was drunk when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the Supreme Court candidate demonstrated her genitals at the evening when they studied in Eiland in the 1980s.
The world's inventor plans to start a new internet to make competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the world's network, launches a startup that will be made by competitors on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform of Berner-Lea Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of the data storage and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company Berners-Li said that, creating Inrupt, he had a "consideration of the world."
“I need to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own data storage on the Internet or POD.
It can contain contact lists, case lists, calendar, fancy and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at once in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data storage on the internet is that only the user determines who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personally strengthening the potential with the help of data."
According to John Bruce's CEO, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, the process and the necessary skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company is now composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several developers working on the project under contract and co-workers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brners-Li said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to enter or not complete changes when all of their business models are instantly reviewed.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a Saturday publication on the issue of Medium Berners-Lie, the mission of Inrupt "is providing commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of a new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lie transformed the Internet, creating a World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Ley has been very influential for the network neutrality.
Even by launching Inrupt, Berners-Li remains the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: The honor of the saint, awarded by Victory's Cross in the First World War
The only sacrament of the English church, awarded by Victoria's Cross during the First World War, was celebrated in its city for 100 years.
Bernard Van was awarded on September 29, 1918 for his participation in the attack on Belenglish and Leacurus.
After four days, however, he died from the shooter and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, in the city of Rashden, the county of Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren on the parade opened a memorial stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone was opened just 100 years after his uncle was awarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, sub-seminar Van led his battle through the Canal de San Quentin "through a dense moment and under a strong pink and a burning fire of the worker."
Then he fled to the fire line and "with great courage" led the soldiers ahead, self-sufficiently toiled the army and wiped out three subdivisions.
Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month after the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Van said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to do and nothing worthy of respect.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a knife after a parade, which was originalized by the Imperial Youth Archer of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that “for his great honour to participate in the parade” and added that “the marriage of a true hero was demonstrated by support that many have shown.”
The fans of MMA waited all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they got a pig Pepa.
Just imagine, you've stayed all night to look at the packed transmission from Bellator 206, and then you're rejected in view of the main event.
In the program from San Jose there were 13 games, including six on the main map, and they were showcased on the direct radio all night on the British television channel Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gerar Musas and Rory McDonald were preparing for the hit, watchers in the UK just ate when the program changed to Pepa's pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a night without sleep, waiting for this battle.
One of the ballots on Twitter called the switch to a child male as a "city's stupid laughter".
In response to the question of broadcasting, Dave Schwartz, senior Vice-President Bellator on marketing and communications issues, said: "In accordance with the State Statute and 6 in the morning, this content was unnecessary and had to be switched to a child program."
"Yes, Pig Pepa."
Bellator Scott Coker's president said they would work on the program in the future to consider British audiences.
"I think we are discussing the possibility of repeating, perhaps, we can solve this issue," Coker said.
"But now is the sixth morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday at our time, and this is Monday at their time.
But we do everything we can.
When the programs changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were nice.
We tried to solve the problem, considering that this is a technical error.
But it seemed to be a state law.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We cut the number of catches from six to five as usual and we do this, this time we wanted to order fans, but we are over-old.
This is a region’s situation.”
The "Children of the Unpleasant Island": Tom Dale felt "insignificant" due to sexuality
Tom Dale's Olympic viewer at the water jumps said he grew with a sense of insignificantness for others due to his sexuality – but this gave him motivation on the way to success.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone like me" had gone to high school.
Speaking in the program "Desk of the Immunity Island" Radio 4 in leading Lauren Lavern, he said he supports the rights of gays to give another "hope".
He also said that if he had a child, he began to think less about the win at the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this pretty old program, Kirsty Yang, took a rest for a few months due to the disease.
In the role of a man who appeared on the unpleasant island, on Lavern's first program, Dale said he felt "minder" in childhood for all others, because "the society did not accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, “I now think that this feeling that you are not like everything and insignificant was that gave me strength and inspiration for success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said that he would not disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The double bronze prize of the Olympics has made a significant LGBTI movement activist and in the Australian Association Games this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his condolences, because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give "hope" to another.
Three times the world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American script, director and director Dastin Lance Blake, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me.”
Daley married the owner of Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but, according to him, the difference in age doesn't matter.
“When you pass through such a young age,” he saw the first Olympics at the age of 14, and after three years his father died of cancer, he said it was difficult to find a balanced person who would survive such floods and underwear.
In June, they became parents, their son was born by Robert Ray Black Dale, and Dale said his "perspectives" had changed completely.
"If you asked me last year, I would have told you that I need to win the gold medal," he said.
"You see, there are things in the world that are more important than the golden Olympic medal.
It's my gold medal."
His son is also born as his father – Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first series.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t sit in the first line, Dad’,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
The next year, Daley competed for the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that it was exactly what I’ve done all my life – jumping in the water before my ballots at the Olympics, that’s the best feeling,” he said.
This also influenced the choice of the song – Proud from Heiser Smol – which has found a comment in it in preparation for the Olympics and from which and now the mosquitoes are running.
The "Children's Unpleasant Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, who isn't in the form, stays on the back of Rider's cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Michelson will record on Sunday, playing his 47 matches in the Ryder Cup, but he must return the form so that this event will not become uncomfortable.
Michaelson, who will play in this competition, which will be held once every two years, is recorded 12th time, Captain Jim Furrick's team seated on a reservoir on Saturday forbol.
Instead of being in the center of the events, and he was there frequently behind the United States team, the five-ticket winners of the cup shared his days between the work of a cluster and training, hoping to return to form.
Even at the top of his career, he wasn't the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer isn't an ideal choice for the uncomfortable Le Golf National field, where hardly unprecedented hits are punished.
And if the field itself is dark enough, Michaelson will fight in nine matches on Sunday against the precise British Open champion of Francesco, who, together with Tommy Flitwood, won all four matches this week.
If Americans who stand at the four keys at the beginning of 12 single matches start with success, Michaelson's match may seem extremely important.
Furrick expressed confidence in this player, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood his role today, hitting me backwards, hanging and saying that tomorrow will be ready," Fyurik said.
“He is very confident in himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan him for two matches.
I planned more, but that's exactly what we thought we were going to play.
He wants to be in the field, as well as all the others.”
Michaelson killed Nick Fald's record for the number of matches played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This can be the end of a career in the Rider Cup, which has never been the same as achievement in individual games.
In Michaelson's 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furrick said that his presence had benefited the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humanity, loves to beat over humans and is just a very good man to have good in the team," he explained.
"I think that more young players were happy to beat his shirts, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Burn knows that the big headquarters can soon disappear.
Thomas Burn, captain of the European team, knows with experience that he has opened significantly before the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup, can easily disappear.
The Danish player debuted in the 1997 matches in Valderamo, where the European team under the leadership of Seve Ballesters preferred five points over the Americans, but finished with a minimum advantage of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2
"You constantly remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderam and won, but with the difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brussels, where they lost," Burn said after watching as the team of Class of 2018 won 5-3 and 6 on Friday, and Leroy on Friday.
"The story tells me and everyone else in the team that this isn't the end yet.
Tomorrow we'll have to play a hundred.
Go to the field and do everything right.
Until the keys appear in the table, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and this is an attempt to win this traffic, that's what we're focusing on.
I constantly say this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we very well understand that the best players on the whole are on the side of the world."
Enjoyed that his players played on a hard field for golf, Burn added: "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow there will be a completely different game.
Tomorrow there will be individual games, and it's quite different.
It's just great if you're on the field with a partner and everything goes well, but if you're playing one, here's your true golfer's talents.
Here's what you've got to do with the players, and they've got to show the best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave a partner, we have to go and show everything better as an individual player."
Unlike Burn, his competitor Jim Furrick hopes for the best individual game of his athletes than the one they demonstrated in partnership, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three keys out of four.
Furrick himself was on both sides of these matches last day, playing in the winning team in Brussels and passing when Europe had a "Cod in Medina."
"I remember every word of this," he said, replying to a question like Ben Cranesho, Captain of 1999, adjusted his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start you’ve seen in Brussels and Medina.
When the speed increases, the highest pressure is on those who play games in the middle.
We made a corresponding schedule and put the players as we liked. You know, tomorrow we're going to try to get some magic."
Thomas received the task to start playing and play against Rory Michaelroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Jan Paul will play against top golfers.
"I put my players in such a order, because I think I'll close it all," Burn said about his choice for individual matches.
The new German military ship is delayed again.
The new fleet of the German Navy had to enter the building in 2014 to replace old military ships during the Cold War, but it will appear not earlier in the next year due to false systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local messages.
The release of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the absolute new-class Baden-Wuerttemberg, was delayed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
Carbel had to enter the building in 2014, but problems that occurred after construction prevent this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class warships, ordered yet in 2007, should replace the old Bremen class fregates.
They will be armed with strong arms, various anti-capacity and anti-season missiles, as well as some of the “steles” technologies, for example, reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics – longer periods between teaching service – newer fregates may not enter their party until two years.
Continuous extensions, however, mean that modern battleships – which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country – will stand up until they finally enter the building, says Die Zeit.
The F125 hit the head last year when the German Navy officially refused to take a ship and returned its Blohm & Voss vessel to Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the lift after delivery.
The reason for returning is obviously small, but the German media wrote about the many "software and hardware defects" that make the ship devastating in the fighting mission.
The disadvantages of the software were particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have only 120 matroses – half of the crew of the old Bremen class.
It has also been found that the ship has a very high weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, double the weight of similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to missing equipment, the price of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
The price reached incredibly 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - at first 2.2 billion euros.
Problems accumulated with new fragmats become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's marine power is reducing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee in the German parliament, said that the Navy "has less ships capable of military missions."
He said that the problem is growing over time because the old ships are being saved, and the ships are not being replaced.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's classmates were able to join the Navy.
The National Society of Defense of Memories has listened to the secret life of the
A new study conducted in the Scottish Mountains is aimed at discovering how landscapes are said to be used in hunting for food.
Students hope to find something new in the behaviour of unique flying milk feeders and help in future actions to protect these animals.
The study of the National Society for the Protection of Monuments of Scotland is engaged in small statements and also burning long statements by Dabanton in the Invery Gardens in Western Russia.
Special recording devices will be placed in the main locations of this site to monitor the actions of the dishes throughout the season.
Workers and employees will conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
The analysis of the sounds of all records determines the frequency of calls to speak, as well as what they are saying to do.
The map of residence and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Djuar, the National Trade Commission's adviser on the conservation of nature, hopes that the results will show which areas are the most important for the animals and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to identify the advantages of creating places of residence such as loaves, and how to support glasses for the residence of dishes and other animals associated with them.
The number of reports in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly in the last century.
They threaten construction and development work that affects the place of residence and destroys them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be at risk, as well as lipid strips for mushrooms and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
It's not really blind.
However, due to their nightlife, the ears were more sensitive than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a complex technique of emulation to detect scratches and obstacles on the way to the flight.
The national company responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country is very seriously taken to say.
It works with ten scholars who regularly conduct research, checking accommodations and, sometimes, rescue events.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish witness of the prophecies in the county of Troy in Damphrys and Galaway, where eight of the ten prophecies of Scotland live.
David Thompson says that it's the ideal territory for people.
“There, in Troy, we have just a great place to say,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old woods and a very good place to stay.
But we don't know much about things yet, so our work here and in other places will help to understand more about what they need for a better life."
He emphasizes the importance of verification of the presence of prosecutors before carrying out the repair of the property, as one seat can be inevitablely destroyed by killing up to 400 prosecutors and young prosecutors, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
It is said that they are under the protection and are prohibited from killing, killing, or destroying their seats.
Elizabeth Feral, a police officer in Scotland, calls for the public to help in this matter.
She said, "We need to learn a lot about our stories, and about many of the species we don't even know how to live their populations."
Ranaldo is accused of rape and his lawyer will be brought to court in a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called his accusation of raping "fake news," saying that people want to "reclame themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will be brought to court for the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
Forward of the Assembly of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape by American Katherine Mayorgue in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He later paid her $375,000 for the rape, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
In the Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ranald turned to 142 million of his subscribers within a few hours after the release of the accusations, calling this message "featuring news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said a five-time gold ball owner in front of the camera.
“They want to make an advertisement in my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
"I'm a happy and good man," he added with a smile.
Ranaldo lawyers are preparing a case in court against the journal Der Spiegel on the matters of charges, which have called a "inadmissible message of allegations in private affairs," Reuters reports.
Christian Shertz’s lawyer said that the player would require compensation for “moral damages in the amount that corresponds to the difficulty of violations of laws, and in recent years it may be the most serious violation of personal laws.”
The incident took place in June 2009 at the luxury room of the Palms Houtel and Casino in Las Vegas.
A meeting at the nightclub of Ranald and Majorga would have returned to the number of footballers, where he would have raped her anal, as written in the documents of the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after this, Ranald knocked down and said that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who suffers from "one percent."
The documentation states that Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but according to the agreement of the parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and made the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to the prejudice, because "very feared revenge" and she didn't know she was "publicly brought".
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to recover the accusation now because she feels a moral trauma for the case.
In the meantime, as if there were a place, this case of Ronaldo was going to move to Madrid Real from Manchester United, and this summer he went to Italy's Juventus, shutting down a trade of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will "always damage" the loss of car builders
The UK is "always ruined" when losing its status as the world leader of automotive construction after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clarke said.
He added that he would "refresh" his statement by Toyota UK to BBC that if the UK joins the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily cut production at a factory in Bernston, unfamiliar Derby attacked half.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact on the border resulting from Brexit without agreement could lead to the cut of workplaces.
The factory in Bernaston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis were made – released nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my view, when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director at Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK raised the question of how the cross-border sandal will be implemented when Britain leaves the EU without agreement. Among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem is that automotive manufacturers say about the risk of supply chains resulting from Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works based on "accurately in time" when spare parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK will reach the EU package on March 29 without an agreement, there may be cross-border battles that will lead to a disruption and a lack of shares.
For Toyota, it will be impossible to hold more parts in a factory in Derby for a day, the company said, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clarke said the “Chackers Plan” Teresa May on future relations with the EU was “made precisely to avoid these examinations at the border.”
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that will not only allow us to succeed today, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should have the opportunity to continue the work of successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to report how long the production will not work, but has warned for the future that the added cost will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will lead to the cut of jobs.
Peter Cuvaliris, who has been working at Bernston for 24 years and is a co-ordinator of the trade unions, said that the members of the trade unions are very disturbed: "I think if the jobs are cut off, they will no longer be restored.
"We have proposed a precise plan of our future relations with the EU, which deserves trust."
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again
The very important meeting of Donald Trump with the Assistant Attorney-General Rode Rosenstein may be "delayed to another week", while the fight around the candidate's Supreme Court, Bret Cavano, said the White House representative on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who studys involvement in Russia's elections, Trump's supporters' connections with Russia and the potential obstacle to justice from the president.
Release Trump's deputy prosecutor general or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, oil has been burning your Washington flight for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from the post with a 25 message.
Rosenstein rejected it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of the news that he was going to be resigned.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations headquarters in New York, will take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would "not want" to announce Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid meetings in hearing in the legal committee of the Senate, where Cavanato and one of the women who accused him of sexual charges.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation by the FBI against Cavano, which further slowed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's secretary Sarah Sanders appeared in the Fox News Sunday program on Sunday.
When she asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The data has not yet been assigned, perhaps, this week, perhaps, to the next. I think, sooner, a week later, taking into account all the other things that have a place in the matter of the Supreme Court.
But it's going to happen, and I'm always giving the press the latest information."
Some journalists are ready to express her confirmation: Sanders hasn't spent browsing for the press in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the leader of the program, asked her why.
Sanders said that the rareness of browings is called not to burn to television stations that "work on the public," adding: "I remember the fact that they work on the public."
Then she said that Trump's direct contact and the press would increase.
"The president is meeting more with the answers to the press questions than any president before him," she said, adding without specific facts: "We have studied these figures."
The brifing is happening, said Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the U.S. President's questions immediately, it is much better than to do it through me.
We try to do this often, you saw how we did this in the last few weeks. Such meetings on which you can ask the question directly to the president, replace browsing."
Trump regularly answers questions if he leaves the White House or will participate in meetings on the street, or in press conferences with high foreign guests.
The president's press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York demonstrated why he was free and sometimes extreme before the journalists.
Health Minister wrote to workers from EU countries in the Health System of Scotland before Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from the EU working on the Health System of Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and to wish them to stay after Brexit.
John Friman sent a letter less than half a month before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of residence requests from EU citizens working in the state services of the country.
In his letter, Mr. Freman wrote: "The summer negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued to leave our country. They are leading to the expected solutions this autumn.
But the British government has also hurryed to prepare for the scenario without an agreement.
I know that this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you of how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of its nationality.
Our colleagues from all EU countries, and not only, provide valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of healthcare services, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christian Abercrombie transferred emergency surgery after a head trauma
The Tennessee State Tigers team's lanebacker Christian Abercrombie passed the emergency operation after he won a trauma in a Sunday match that his team played 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores team, Mike Organ from Tennesseen reported.
Tennessee's main coach Rod Rod told the reporter that the player's trauma got soon to stop.
"He went to the rubber line and suddenly fell," said Rid.
Trainers and physicians further Abercombi oxygen still on the ground before placing it on the ground and moving to establish a diagnosis.
Tennessee State representative Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, said Abercrombie was pro-operated at the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Today he added that there is no “detail about what it was trauma,” and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the player received the trauma.
Abercombe, a second-course athlete, takes place the first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five complete captures, giving only 18 captures per season.
Foreign buyers of the British real estate will pay a large amount of money.
According to the new plan of conservatives, foreign real estate buyers will pay higher shipping, and additional money will go to help unemployed
This action neutralizes the success of Corbin's initiative in attracting young voters
The rise of government shipping will be paid to those who don't pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year with the help of unemployed
Theresa May today announces that foreign real estate buyers will pay a higher government shipping, and additional money will go to help without cost.
This action is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative in attracting young voters, as well as still available housing. It is aimed at people with high income.
The rise of government shipping is aimed at individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the regular program of housing unemployed.
The rise of current government affairs, including higher levels, taken two years ago, to buy second houses and homes for rent, can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to get up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by UK non-residents, which will lead to price rise and new buyers are hard to buy their first home.
Many rich regions of the country – especially the capital – have become “private cities”, because a large number of buyers outside the border spend most of their time not in the UK.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after Barry Johnson's call to reduce the public shipping for young buyers to facilitate the purchase of the first housing.
He accused huge building companies of holding high prices for real estate by taking the land and its use, and called on Mr. May to cancel quotas for the available housing to direct the "bad situation with the housing" in Btan.
Speaker Corbin announced a loud series of housing reforms, including the control of the rays and the stop of the "inconsistent" displacement.
He also wants to give the local council more powers in the area of building houses.
"Last year, I stated that devoting my job to the position of the Prime Minister to restore British Mary - life for every new generation should be better.
This means the improvement of our incomplete housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is unfair that people who don't live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as UK workers.
For too many people, having their own home must become more and more inaccessible, and the problem of the uncertain remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage the Scottish assembly"
Sanderland coach Jack Ross said his main ambition would ever become a coach of the Scottish collection.
The 42-year-old Scottish performs the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three keys from the first.
He went to this work in the summer, after returning to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it wasn't done," Ross said in the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“I grew up, often sick of Scotland at the Hampdon stadium with my father, and something always forced me to return.
However, this is the opportunity to come when I'm a successful club coach."
Among the predecessors of Rose on the post of Senderland coach Dick Lawyer, David Moss, Sam Alardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Poe and Paul de Canya.
A former coach "Aloe Athletics" says that he didn't feel afraid of such known names in such a large club, previously rejecting proposals from "Bransley" and "Ipswich Taun".
“Now I will be successful to answer the question “Can I return this club to Premier League?”
According to the structure and material base of the club, its place is probably in Prime Minister Liz," he said.
"I'm not just going to get him back there, but I'm going to think my job is successful only if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only worked as a coach for three years, until that he was the assistant coach in Dembarton and worked for 15 months at the coach headquarters in Harts.
He then helped Alao return from the third league and transformed the San-Miren from a failed man who almost hit the Champions League in the winner of the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than during his career at Claydon, Hartpool, Falkirk, Sen-Miren and Hamilton Academic.
He said, “This was a really important choice.”
“I really believed that the work of training is what I need, even more than the game.
It sounds incredible because I've worked well, earned well, and achieved certain heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I'm going through this when I'm talking about stress and pressure, but the work of training is what you need.
I always wanted to exercise and now I'm dealing with it, and for me it's the best time for my adult life."

The hot summer has increased the profits of British potatoes that are fighting for survival, but has brought pressure on a network of restaurants.
According to the statistics of the group of potatoes and bars, sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, but sales volume decreased by 4.8 percent in restaurants.
Peter Martin, a consultant of the CGA business group, who collected this statistics, said: "It's going to pass sun weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English collection8 in the final of the World Cup is much higher than the second year, and the second year, the second year, the second year, the second year, the second year, in July.
Sales in restaurants decreased by 1.8% in June, just worsened in July.
Boobs and bars that mostly sell drinks have shown the best result, unlike restaurants.
Potatoes that sell food more are also covered in the sun, although they are not as strong as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to drink.
In potatoes and bars, drink sales grew by 6.6 percent, and food sales dropped by three percent.
Paul Neuman, RSM analyst on the issues of rest and placement, said: “These results are made by the trend we see since the end of April.
The impact of important social and sporting events remains the most important factors when it comes to volumes of sales in the public food market.
It's not surprising that restaurants continue to compete because sales have fallen by 4.8% per year, and this is very unpleasant when cost is constantly growing.
The long and hot summer has come to be the most challenging time for operators that are focused on food, and the time will show whether lower temperatures in August will take such an expectation.”
The overall growth of sales in cabins and restaurants, including recently opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a delay in brand deployment.

Each fifth child has a secret account in social networks that it hides from parents.
The study showed that every five children – some have only 11 – have secret accounts in social networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
Studying 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "Fake Insta" page
It's scary that there's sex content.
Twelve percent of the students said they had a "base" account showing to parents
Each fifth child – some of them only completed 11 – creates accounts in social networks that keep in the mystery of parents.
Studying 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth of Facebook Insta accounts – which would be leading to Instagram’s photo exchange site.
This is the fear that there are sexual contents.
Twelve percent of the students said they conduct "clean" "base" accounts to show their parents, and also conduct private accounts.
One mother who accidentally found a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter learned that she called others to "rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of teenagers aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them recognized that they had secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buckenan said: "It's very sad that so many teenagers want to create places on the internet where neither parents nor teachers will find them."
Elide Doyle will be a "vote of athletes" in the Scottish Light Athletics Council
Elide Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Light Athletics as a supervisory member of the Council on the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle – Scotland's most titled lightweight athlete and senior Ian Bicy described this event as a great opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from her experience at the most diverse levels, including international for the last decade.
"Elyde is used with great respect in Scotland, the UK, and the world's sports community, and we are sure that easy athletics in Scotland will get a lot more useful from its work in the world," Biki said.
Doyle said, “I want to act as a voice of athletes and I hope to help manage sports in Scotland.”
The American who won gold at the Atlantic Olympics in the distance of 200 and 400 meters, and two other gold medals at the other Olympics, and who are currently working as an expert at the BBC, can't go after the microinsult.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a hit a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it was time to tell me if I'm going to go to what level.
It's been a hard work, but I've been completely corrected, I've learned to go again and now I'm doing exercises on the aging!
Thank you for your support message!”
Advertising of a small pump, where mothers compare to cows, shared measurements online
The company for the production of small pumps shared measurements, issued an advertisement that compares breastfeeding women with the breastfeeding cows.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the "first in the world of a hopeful little pump" Elvie's consumer company released an Iranian video-based music ad to show the freedom that this device gives to a nursing mother.
The four real mothers dance in the sweat with the cows under the song, where there are the words: "Yes, I give myself, but I'm sick of it" and "In case you didn't notice, it's not cooking, it's my chest."
And he singed, "Yes, yes, I feed the child, yes, yes, yes, I give my wives."
However, the advertisement that was placed on the company's Facebook page caused a hot discussion on the internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The response to the video was inequality, many said it was scary of small production.
“It’s a very peculiar solution to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be pregnant and be born to give milk, here are only their children picking in a few days," a spectator wrote.
Elvie's small pump is unprecedentedly hid in breastfeeders (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says: “It is obviously traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Why shouldn't they be used for advertising a small pump for a mother who doesn't have children alone?"
Someone added, “This is such an unpredictable ad.”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman wrote that the song was considered "deceased."
“I think this is a genial idea.
I'd like to have that if I'd like to have my chest.
The milk is causing me to feel asleep.
It's a little bit bad, but I liked it.
"It's a genial product," she wrote.
Another commentary: "Very desperate ads aimed at a mother that absorbs milk pumps (sometimes at work or in the toilet) and hears themselves "cows".
This advertisement does not approve and condemn the small industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that all of them danced with unseen small pumps hidden in the breasts.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel scared.
However, the Elvie Pump is full-free, does not have any leads, nor is the tube and is directly hiding in breastfeeders for women, giving women freedom of movement, allowing children to keep and even get out of the house during the work of the device.
Ana Baloni, partner and creative director of Mother, noted: "Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a clear and straightforward launch.
We want to pay attention to the absorption of milk and its difficulty while demonstrating a fatal and cold way of bringing a new small pump to an extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time that Elvie's little pump is in the center of attention.
During London's week of fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the dress of Martha Jakobovsky, using this product.
Hundreds of migrants are transported to a target camp on the border of Texas without excess noise
Although the number of border transitions per month has almost not changed, the cut has grown the number of detained children-immigrants, partly for this reason, serves a strict rhetoric and politics conducted by Trump's administration, which has undermined the displacement of children with the world.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are committed to threatening their own residence in the country, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsors and other full-year-old host members will need to submit fingerprints and the data will be transferred to the immigration body.
Last week, immigration and customs service senior Matty Albens, spoke to Congress with a report on the agency of dozens of people who asked to sponsor minors without accompanying them.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of the victims had no trials before.
“Around 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of their hosts are illegal in the country, and a significant portion of them are foreigners with criminal past.
“We continue to pursue such people,” said Mr. Albens.
For faster children's treatment, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month from the date of delay, for which, according to the employees of the premises, the standard term was 60 days earlier.
A large number of people to make a claim on their own legal status of the immigrant judge should use a video connection instead of attending a personal court.
Those who don't have the right to get help are quickly deported.
According to employees of the reception and messages from sources in the system that have appeared in the last months, the longer children remain in abduction, the higher the probability of depression or increase in anxiety, which may lead to explosions of violence or threats.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions such as Tarnilia, these problems are much stronger, as the signs that the child is in a rocky state, with greater probability will be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that the transfer of children to the target city without providing time for emotional preparation or for the development of friends can aggravate the trauma that many have already encountered.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of “business forces” of the U.S., France and Turkey
In return to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Muale, also called for Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that continues in the country for eight years.
Mual, also deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian land, on the basis of fighting against terrorism, and "they will be considered appropriate."
"They must leave immediately without any conditions," he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
Muhammed insisted that in Syria, where more than 300,000 people and millions of people have died since 2011, the war with terrorism has almost ended.
He stated that Damascus intends to continue this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
Around 2,000 U.S. troops are located in Syria, mainly performing the role of instructors and advisers of the forces of the Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who are in the position of President Bashar Assad.
France's land continent in this ruined war country consists of more than 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions for returning are favorable and accused of “some Western countries” in “the spread of ironic threats” that contain refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to regain them," he said.
“They are politically humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be granted aid in restoration until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached.
The U.N. diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major effort of the rebels of Idlib has created an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented a widespread attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province where three million people live.
However, Mohammed emphasized that the deal had "accurate terms" and expressed hope that military action would be aimed at the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda front that would "be destroyed".
U.N. Ambassador Stafhan de Mistura hopes to call on the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition to develop a harmonised constitution for Syria and make a way to the elections.
Mualem expressed the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to the "revision of Articles of the Acting Constitution", and the oversight from the involvement.
Why is Trump going to be on the second
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win in the 2020 elections, when, as many liberal viewers are expected, the impression and the deadline scandal will not complete his presidency.
And this will certainly be “The very dramatic final of the Presidency for the entire history!”
At this point, there are no signs of fatigue of viewers.
Since 2014, ratings have grown more than twice – up to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times – up to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million spectators in prom-time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" MSNBC channel gathered 3.5 million spectators on the screen and passed ratings on cable broadcast.
"This is the fire that people are attracting because we don't understand it," said Nil Berr, director of ABC's drama "President" about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, who became president after the attack that the Capitol destroyed.
In New Scowl, a masterpiece of comedy and authors of the book "Pair of funny details and several hard truths about entering the Hollywood boys club," there is another theory.
She's talking about a taxi trip in Bostan before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because he's happy with me," Mrs. Scowell told me.
The chaos is also worthwhile for what can be patient.
Obviously, unlike all the rest of the television, the series lines that come out of Washington can become as definite future as the case "Row against Wade" will depend on this and will be able to embrace the families of the world immigrants.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can allow.
And yet, when you watch the sixth hour. a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "information not for printing" in the book "The Straights", the shirt of Paul Manofort's shirt is a word for $10,000, it's a word for a hundred dollars, it's a word for Washington, it's a word for a "suit, a word for a printing"

When I talked to Mr. Flakes this week, the windows of his house on the northern coast of Kuwait became a sunny day and 30 degrees warm, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't do it, not even when Brett Coffee stood before the Senate Court Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which was on the hairstyle.
"I remember, thank you, when we released these barbaric shows, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Flakes told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seemed like they had a rise.”

Foreign cash flows are flooded into a strict pre-election race of interim elections in the House of Representatives
Surprisingly, in the 17th election of Pennsylvania, the money layer was closed thanks to the change in the boundaries of the Congress, which causes two candidates to participate in the elections for one place.
The newly painted beautiful area of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conar Lamb, who won his place in another district in the elections of last spring.
Lambu is opposed by another acting deputy, Republican Kit Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which is significantly consistent with the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January stated that the voices of the old regions were non-institutionally counted for the benefit of the Republicans.
The re-election race in the new 17th circle provoked the growth of the company's finance by the financial groups of the main parties, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Company (KDC) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (KRK).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a complex victory for a widely celebrated elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won in a circle with a break at 20 points.
Political experts have a small advantage of the Democrats.
The United States appreciated the possibility of punishment of Salvador for China's support, and then resigned
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported the position of Beijing, despite a small opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varello in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners resigned Trump's leadership team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to reject U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "recent resolutions on the unrecognition of Taiwan", said the Prime Minister of the State.
However, the sanctions were considered only in terms of Salvador, which received about $140 million of U.S. aid in 2017, including the control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduction of financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be critical for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
In order to complete internal meetings, North and Central America's representatives delayed the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic growth, which would have been the future of a similar meeting in the past year.
But by mid-September, the high-speed representatives of the administration continue to understand what they want the conference to take place and actually stopped the consideration of the question of the punishment of Salvador.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pennsy is now speaking at a conference appointed in mid-October, as a sign that the administration is speaking for the conduct of the event.
And three American ambassadors without excessive noise returned to Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without new harsh sending or punishment from Washington.
White House representative Mr. Boltan refused to comment on the details of the debates described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues in terms of maintaining anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by other analysts, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn the History
The next step can be the report of Special Attorney Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to justice by Mr. Trump, on examples of which are currently very difficult evidence in the documents of public nature.
Mr. Mueller has noted the possibility of Trump's and Russia's deal in an election attack.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump stops in front of the face of responsibility before this body, just as he is preparing to play again before the voters, and, perhaps, in the end, before the number of his colleagues.
There is a lot of “when,” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s submission is inevitable, just as it is in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice to determine how long the fight will take place.
In 1938, German officials were ready for the state war against Hitler, if only the West had accused him of opposition and supporting the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have suffered a failure and have allowed us to avoid bleeding in the next few years.
The story is surrounded by such a breakthrough moment, and the incomparable march of democracy is torn or delayed.
Currently, the Americans have encountered several of these break-in moments.
What happens if Mr. Trump releases the Deputy Attorney General Rode Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since then, as the gazette wrote about the fact that last year he proposed to secretly write the words of the president and considered his proficiency.
Mr. Rosenstein said the "The Times" was incorrect.
"How are we going to react if the recently requested FBI investigation into the case of Bret Cavan isn't universal or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite the valuable trust of sexual violence and uncertainty?
And first of all, are we going to vote for the elections that will attract Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we don't go through these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to do that thanks to the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was the Czechoslovakian language, which I deported in the Ascension with the same Nazi regime that I once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and after 60 years she sent me to burn the Saturday candles on this side of the sun.

Gram Dorans from Rangers optimumly adjusted to the preceding match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after a violent night in Spain over the Williams at the beginning of this month will surely allow him to leave the G League of Europe group.
The knees prevented the semi-defence of Grem Dorans from performing for the first time in the season 2-2 with William, but he believes that Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as a tramplin.
“This was an important match for us, because William is a powerful competitor,” he said.
"We started the game, thinking we could get something, and earned a score.
We may have been able to kill the ball at the end, but nothing has been a good result as well.
They looked better at the first time, but in the second time we took our hands, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday, there will be another major event for the European football night.
I hope we will be able to make three keys, but this will be a complex game as they have shown a good result in the last game, but, taking into account the floods on the trunk, I'm sure we'll be able to carry them and package a good game.
Last year, it was difficult for both my injuries and change in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying the game; the training is productive.
I hope we will be able to move forward, achieve the result of the last season and achieve success."
Women lose their sleep due to fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants had a precise idea of what they want to care for themselves, few of them spoke about it with members of their families.
Half of the people who participated in a general study reported that they had talked to their husbands about a cat's long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss this,” says Holly Snowder, Vice-President of Nationalwide on Life Insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk about this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you don't act in advance.
Talk to the consultant and family and talk about where and how to get medical assistance, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Go to the discussion of a financial consultant, it can also help find a way to pay these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or you can self-insured your life – if you have money.
Resolve legal documents: predict legal battles.
Take confidence in the medical service to recognize a trusted person to control your medical service and provide you with the execution of your wishes in the event that you can't talk.
In addition, consider the possibility of providing trust in finance management.
Appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions and make payments for your accounts if you're unfair.
Don't forget about the details: imagine that your father needs immediate medical assistance, and it's on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about the presence of allergies and drugs?
Make sure that these details are written in order to be ready.
"They play a role not only in financial issues but also in physicians' professionalism," Martin added.
"What medicines are needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan everything.”
In Ilfracombe, a man has been shot several times with a pneumonia.
The man got a few shots from the pneumonia when he went home at night.
About 40 years old, she was located in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, County Devon, when she was shot in her chest, her beast and her hand.
Police officers described the shooting that took place at about 02:30 a.m. local time as a "crash accident".
I haven't seen the attacker.
His traumas are not a threat to life, the police are asking a witness to contact them.

The federal prosecutor requires a rare death sentence for a terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking a death penalty for Syfulo Saibov, killed in a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in eight deaths – a rare punishment that was not applied in the state for federal crimes from 19 years of age53.
Sip, 30 years old, was exploited in October by a truck company "Home Depot" to ride on a bicycle road along the six West Coast in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and bicycles on his way.
To justify a death sentence, according to a statement on the intention of obtaining a death penalty in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Siapov has "intuitively" killed eight people and "intuitively" intuitively.
According to the materials of the court, for both infringements, a possible penalty in the form of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the major federal court of the prosecution of Saipova was an accusation from 22 points, which included eight charges in murder to support the traffic trafficking and racket; this item is also used by the federal prosecution in the case of the federal prosecution.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "old and exhaustive planning", and describing Sipa's crimes, used such phrases as "just, harsh and distorted".

A couple of Rosenbergs were punished on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an exile from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated the absence of consciousness in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was pleased with his work.
According to the prosecution, Saipov informed the authorities that the attack was inspired by a video view of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked for permission to set the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital, police reported.
He does not recognize himself guilty of the indictment, which consists of 22 points.
David Pattan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said they were “absolutely disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not to be taken away from life without the possibility of liberation, will only extend the pain of these events to all participants," said Pattan.
The defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to have a death penalty.
A parliamentary member of Thora said Nigel Farage should designate Brexit negotiations.
Today, during the protest at the Tory Party conference, Nigel Faroeg called for "mobilizing the people's army".
Former leader Ukip said that politicians should "have discomfort" from the Eurosceptics - as one of parliamentary members Teresa May proposed his candidate for negotiations with the EU.
A parliamentary member of the Conservative Party Peter Boone said during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would "have gone out" if Mr. Farage would take the position of secretary for Brexit.
But the problem faced by Mr. May, trying to imitate his different fans, has yet to be worsened when Tors, who speak for the preservation of EU membership, have set a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister of all efforts is trying to keep a compromised Checkers agreement under constant pressure from fans and fans of exit, as well as the EU itself.
Allieds are striving to conclude negotiations with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between the package and the "unsufficiency".
Mr. Boone said on a match in Salehall "Leave Means Leave" that he wants to "fine checker from the plate".
He proposed that Mr. Faraj should be made equally and to make commitments to negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have gone out," he said.
A parliamentary member of Wellington added: "I am for Brexit, but we have to leave the Checkers plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We did not conduct world wars to be dependent.
We want to implement our own laws in our country."
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that the public opinion changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British changed their opinion and want to remain is not entirely compliant with reality.”
Andrée Jenkins, the Prime Minister of Brexit and Tora, was also on the march, and in a conversation with journalists, she said: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The chequer plan is unpopular among the broad public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out of the street and choose us.
Please reject the plan and start listening."
She added: “The prime ministers remain in position when they fulfill their promises.”
Speaker Faraj said politicians need to "have discomfort" if they are going to reject the decision taken in a 2016 referendum.
“This is now the question of trust between us – people and politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to say goodbye to Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'This won't get you out of your hand.'"
He added: "I want you to force those politicians who are willing to deceive Brexit to feel discomfort.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit, and we will never be reconciled until we become independent, self-directed, proud of the United Kingdom."
At the same time, the traders went through Birmingham before spending two hours of meetings in the city center.
Several activists have launched Tories Against Brexit (Tories vs. Brexit) after the group's launch on this weekend.
Lord Adanis, Mr. Leybariscy, was shocked by the conservatives on the occasion of the security issue they faced due to the party's program at the opening of the conference.
"These people who tell us that they can be ready to use IT systems and all technologies for Canada plus, for the borders without trinations, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of defeating the president's position
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after her election in November, she “will pay attention to the process of battling the position of President.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from the State of Masachusetts told her future on Saturday during a general east in the West Masachusetts.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to go to reelection, against her from a member of the Republican party Jeff Dzel, who was an elder of Trump's company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of the talks as a possible Trump's competitor in 2020.
Since Trump's entry into the position, it has already been a 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general east, which took place on Saturday in Haliok.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to take the position of the president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair the broken government, and for that reason a woman should be on her head.”
The incident occurred after the death of a basketball player Sims from the University of Louisiana.
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect was murdered by a basketball player, Wade Sims, on Friday.
Police administration Batton-Ruzh announced the death of 20-year-old Dytan Simpson during a press conference that took place at 11 a.m. in the east.
On Friday, they posted a shooting video with a request to help recognize the person who figured on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was arrested on Friday morning near the University of Southern University.
"Wade Sims received a fire injury to the head as a result of his death," said reporter on Saturday to the channel "247sports" police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade was a friend and was arrested by Simpson.
During the investigation, Simpson admitted that he was in the place of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Simpson.
Simpson wasn't resisted during the war and was taken under the police administration of the East Baton Rouge district.
Athlete-junior grew 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) grew in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games in the last season, 10 of which were on the spot from the beginning, on average on the spot from 17,4 points, and on the spot from 5,9 minutes.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion after the winning in-naval deal over the sovereignty of the Fetility
Since then, as Walter Bots warned on Saturday on the qualified arrival of Louis Hamilton, it has become clear that indications within the Mercedes team play a significant role in the race.
Bots pulled out a good place for the rider and almost left Hamilton for the will of fate, while he defended his place at the first two rituals and invited Thethel to attack his friend on the team.
Fetel first went to the pit-stop and left Hamilton to be at the end of the total mass of races, that is, this manufacture had to be resolved.
The pilot "Mersides" went to the pith-stop round later and went out behind the theater, but Hamilton went out ahead after several wheels, which forced the driver "Ferrari" to leave the inner space to get rid of the free space, risking it.
Max Ferstopen began on his 21st birthday from the back line of the network and until the end of the first round was in the seventh place.
He then led most of the race, while holding the tyres, because he wanted to quickly finish, hang Kimi Ricanen and take the fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on the 44th cross, but could not increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raykanen took fourth place.
It was a hard day because Walter played fantastic all weekends and expressed himself to a real gentleman if I was allowed to speak so.
"When the team worked out an outstanding job to occupy the first and second place," Hemiltan said.
It was a really bad language of the body.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Finstein on Saturday because she insisted that it was not the source of the crush letter of Christine Blaise Ford, in which she accused a candidate in the Supreme Court.
Speaking at a meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not address the directions made by Ford before the Court Committee of the Senate, instead of commenting that what is happening in the Senate has shown how people can be “subordinate, aged and non-aged.”
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last few days, is when you see anger when you see evil, crazy, and dirty people,” he said.
“When you read about press releases and sweats, then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
You remember?
Diana Finchstein, is this your daughter?
Remember her answer... you lost the document - "oh, oh, oh, what?
No, no, no.
There was nothing from me.”
Wait a minute.
"We're not allowed, we're not allowed," he added, ordering the Senate.
Finchstein sent a letter with a detailed explanation of the charges made by Ford against Cavan, and he came back in early September – but Finchstein refused that the escape came out of her office.
"I didn't like Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't allow her history to be stunned," Finchstein told the committee, The Hill said.
"She asked the story to remain confidential and I satisfied her request."
But her rejection probably didn't like the president, who so pronounced this during the Saturday meeting: "That's all I'll tell you, it was really a bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do this, but it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Prosecuting the defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual claims by three women, the president stated that Democrats are using accusations for their own purposes.
"They're totally willing to return their powers with any means.
You see submission, objection, and they all equal to what they are doing, through whom they have to break to get authority and control,” the president said.
Elit League: Dandy Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwayer killed two shots in the match against Dandy
Dandy Stars played for the Friday tournament given to him by Belfast Giants as part of the Elite League, winning a reverse match with 5-3 in the home match on Saturday.
Due to the attacks of Patrick Dwayer and Francis Babiel Giants, they were led to two shades at the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney were worth the number before Dwayer restored the leadership of Giants.

Duicher provided Diamant's leadership when he went to the first stop, killing his second fight for meeting at the end of the first period.
The side was over-grouped, and Bushar re-elected the account, killing the sheep in the county overcoming of the team (27:37).
Kaun and Charles Carcoran helped Nilstein take Dandy to the leader for the first time for the match at the end of the second period, and he secured victory along with the fifth number of teams in the middle of the last period.

According to the Australian program "ABC News", according to the representative of "Air Navigation Indonesia" Johannes Siraitha, the decision of the director possibly saved hundreds of lives.
We were preparing a plane from Balikopan to Kalimanthane, which had to carry it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, until he arrived at the airport.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities are aware that the number of victims can reach several thousand, and the agency on the reduction of natural disasters claims that access to the city of Dongguan, Sigi and Button is limited.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the agency, said: "Maybe the number of victims is still increasing, as many bodies have not yet been able to get rid of the collapse."
The rainbows reaching up to six meters decayed the palace, where a mass defeat will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing humanitarian assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute of the "speed" machine brings bodies.
Clean water isn't missing.
They do shops everywhere.”
Jan Gelfhand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the “CNN”: “The Indonesian Red Cross is helping those who have survived, but we don’t know what they are waiting for here.
It's a tragedy, but it can be a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joe Odod arrived in Pole on Sunday and told the military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?” he said.
Earlier this year, Indonesia had already suffered from earthquakes in Lamboke, where more than 550 people died.
Aerial disaster in Ukraine: according to "Air Niugini" a man fled without news after the landing of the plane
The airline, which carried out an accidental flight on a Pacific landing in Ukraine, previously stated that all 47 passengers and the team had successfully evacuated from the plane that had been flying, and now it is reported that the plane has disappeared.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday she could not report on the location of one passenger-man.
The airline reported it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The airline did not immediately inform the passenger details; for example, its age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and crew after the landing of the plane on the water when attempting to catch up at the airport of the island of Chuvk.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven people had been killed in the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in hospital on Saturday; they were all in a stable state.
The causes of breaking, as well as the exact sequence of events remain unexplained.
According to the statements, both the airlines and the U.S. Navy, the airplane drove into the lagoon without going to the post office.
According to the messages of some witnesses, the airplane runs the hall.
According to U.S. passenger Bill Janes, the plane was very low.
“It’s very successful,” said Janes.
According to him, he and other people were able to walk in a belt to the accidental departure of the plane that had already been defeated.
He said that the officers were injured and began to cry, as well as that he had a small head trauma.
The U.S. Navy reports that marathons that ran out of ports also helped rescue by using a forced boat to transport people on the shore until the plane dropped at the depths of about 100 meters (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Security Network, 111 people have died in the fall of aircraft registered in Popa New Guinea over the past 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst restores the movement of events at night when a woman was burned by a home
On Saturday, the charge concluded the presentation of evidence in the case of a man accused of burning the resident of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Roulette for a few hours gave evidence as an attractive expert in the field of information analysis.
He swore to use recordings from mobile phones to recover the transfer of 29-year-old respondent Quintan Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers in the night of her death.
According to "The Clarion Ledger", he received information about the locations from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, which contradicts his past statement.
When the data that his mobile phone was close to Chembers' phone at the time when, according to his affirmation, he was confirmed with his friends Michael Senford, the police were aimed at sending Senford.
He said that he wasn't in the city on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city.
When the side of the accused asked whether Teresa said the truth that Sanford was in the truck that night, he said that he "smith as my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was Tellis' affirmation that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Telephone records indicated that they knew each other all week.
According to Roulette, some time after his death, Chambers Tellis removed her messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He's got her out of his life," said Haley.
The side of the defense should start the disputes of the sides on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be transferred to the swear later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?

They want to come back to his roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Executors such as Akala and Lowkey have returned to collections such as The Fugees and Common, popularity in the UK.
Is there another dark snake?!
Nijana from New York City is prosecuted for a marriage couple for a "russical" message after marriage
Nini from New York City is in court for a divorce couple for a distracting message after receiving a randomly sent message from her mother with a complaint that she is "something a dark smoke."
A couple denied that they were racists, referring to the positions of “exposure”.
In 2016, Linsey Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed to find that a new girlfriend, Zhizel Moris, was dark when she arrived on her first working day.
“NEEEEA, JEHOVAH’S OTHER BLACKSKURARY,” Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent a message twice to Mrs. Moris.
As the New York Post reports, understanding the error, Plaska-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Moris, claiming that the former woman, who was also an Afro-American, was poorly dealing with the work, and that she was waiting for her place in the Philippines.
Mrs Moris paid the work day and sent home to Uber.
Moris is now a pair of courts and wants to get compensation for resignation under the conditions under which she was initially hired, although and without a contract: $350 a day for six months with residence.
“I want to show them that it is not possible to do so,” she told Post on Friday. “I know that it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the accusations of racism, affirming that Moris was a reasonable solution, taking into account what they could not believe her, after her deceiving her.
"My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said the Post’s husband, Joel Plaska.
“Do you trust your children to whom you have suffered, even by chance?
"Your nose?"
Isn't it?”
Plaska refers to the position of "excellence" and reports that his wife was born only two months ago and was in a "very complicated situation".
Are you going to pursue a man in such a situation?
"It's pretty hard," added a banking specialist.
Although judicial debate continues, the public opinion has quickly condemned a couple in social networks, undermining criticism of their behavior and logic.
The publishers said that the readers wouldn't overcome the bears that talked to be spoken in a new list.
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, wrote a letter: "Whoever puts himself in the place of the one who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's so nice to read it, already knowing about the great success of Paddington."
She told her father, who worked with the BBC operator before he was eager to write a book for children about a small toy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work was not received and added that the 60th anniversary of his edition of the book was a "good-hound"
She added that her father was silently honored him for his ultimate success, saying about Paddington, which she describes as a "very important member of our family."
“He was quite quiet, and wasn’t totally excited,” she said.
"But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost a parental honour for the child that somehow has been done: you are surprised at him, although in fact it's not your merit.
I think he's looking at the success of Poland just in that key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave the right to the Podingtan himself."
My daughter died, and I had to get her on the phone.
After her landing, her daughter was delivered to Nizza Lewis Pastor 2, where doctors were freely fighting for her life.
“I was on a regular phone to tell you that everything is really bad that it does not endure,” said Eden-Laperuza.
"Then Nad called me to tell me she will die in the next two minutes, and I had to talk to her.
And I did it.
I said, “Dad, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors who gave her to fear her heart slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and it was the end.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was dead there.
I couldn't cry or cry, because there were people around me.
I had to stay.”
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laupers, who had experienced the loss of her daughter, traveled on a plane with other passengers - and they didn't even know what she had to go through.
“No one knew,” she said.
"I've been shaking my head and tears on my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's the case that I've got the feeling of Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her.”
Females who are trying to get rid of the cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their dear people who have ended with suicide do their best so that other people don't lose their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey exhibit cards on hot words and phone numbers that people can get help on a bridge in Wales.
David Tyler's son was 13 when he started depression, and at the age of 18 he ended his life with suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel as I feel,” she said.
A 45-year-old wife, David, who lives in Lydda, said her son was a talented boss with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light every room.”
However, before his death, he left the job because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found the body of his brother when he ended with suicide.
David said, “I’m constantly worried that this may have unpleasant consequences.”
David created cards, "to the people know there are people in the world that you can turn to and talk to, even if he is a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Hasfrey, who has been a friend of David for many years, lost Mark, her partner who lived with him for 15 years, in a short time after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell him that he was sad, or that he was in depression, or something like that," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude changed.
On the day of the feast, he was very upset: when the children opened gifts, he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but it was necessary to live with him: “There was a huge disgrace in the family.
It just kills us.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Breta Cavano is uncertain because the FBI is starting the investigation.
“I thought we could have what he wants – limited in time and in the scope of the investigation – we can get a little bit of unity,” Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he wouldn’t worry that the committee “develops” due to the fact that it is actually tested.
Why is Cavano and his Republicans not wanting the FBI to investigate?
Their unexpectedness is sometimes interpreted.
The intermediate elections in just five weeks, November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans will catch the parade, then they will be weakened in their attempts to select the candidate to the Supreme Court they need.
George Bush called on Senator to prepare the support of Mr. Cavano, who worked in the White House during Bush's Presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as a personal secretary Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting.
Until noted whether Mr. Cavano would receive at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to resolve the problem of equality of voices and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives declined under the leadership of Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since the arrival of Kim Chen Yin seven years ago, South Korean official said.
Back Bo Sun, led by the South Korean ministry's unification data, stated that last year there were 1127 refugees, and in 2011 2706.
Mr. Pak said that the main reasons are reinforced cross-border control between North Korea and China and higher prices imposed by counterbanks for shipping.
Pennsylvania didn't talk about it.
Most of the South Koreans from the north have to get the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, with which North Korea is the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMS) between the two Koreans, which is very strongly protected.
China considers refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees and often forced them to repatriate.
Relationships between North and South – which are technically still in the state of the war – have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of a month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for negotiations with the denuclearization.
This took place after the historical meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yin in June in Singapore, when they agreed in general to work with the aim of freeing the Korean peninsula from the nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ry Yan Ho accused of U.S. sanctions in the absence of progress since then.
"Unreliable to the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we will not be the first to disarma," Mr. Ri said in a direct statement at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Breta Cavanate an "esthetic", she says she shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority at the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has appointed the candidate to the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano a "istheric" and has stated that under his temperature he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
He said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune edition in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman behaved like that, she would be called a "historical," Philosophy said about her reaction to Cavano's speech before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano is an emotional abrogation of the accusation of sexual claims against Dr. Christina Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During her speech, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and couldn't speak when his family and senior school classes were discussed.
He also expressly accused the Democrats of the committee, calling the charges against his "great and organized person murder", organized by the liberals, who were defeated due to the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 president.
He said that he was not able to work in the Supreme Court, because he clearly showed that he had a prevention against the Democrats.
"I think he himself disqualified with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and Democrats," she said.
She wondered if she was going to try the Cavanate vaccine when it was chosen and when the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so – if he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he doesn’t just have to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he’s working right now,” Pelosi said.
At this time, Kavano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Peloshi added that as a member of the Democratic Party she would dismiss her potential decisions against the Cavano against the law on available medicine or in the case Rov vs. Wade, as Cavano is considered a conservative judge.
In hearings on the confirmation of the position, Kavano did not answer the question whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now it's not time for the sterile, objective individuals to work in court and to expect from us the words "how wonderful it is," Pelosi said.
Women should be able to do so.
This is a true prosecution, months and years of anger is simply moving, and it can't remember it without tears.
"We're crying when we're angry," Mr. Stanley told me 45 years ago.
“I don’t think this is such a rareness.”
She continued: "I was very helpful to a woman who worked with the director somewhere, and who spoke that when she was knocked, she was crying, but she developed the technique of behaviour. When she knocked and began to cry, she said, "I am crying, you can cry.
But I'm angry."
And I just went on to talk.
I think it was great.”
Tears are partially allowed to get out of the amount, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from the first work I once cried for innocence of wrath, then hid me behind the conqueror of the lady – a stubborn head who always made me a little worse – and threw me into the footsteps.
"Never let me see you in your tears," she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad and will be happy that they have given you.”
Patricia Šrodar, at the time a Congress Democrat from the state of Kalarad, worked with Gary Hart in the president's company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt asked for a wedding ban on a yacht called Monkey Business and came out of the presidential race, Mr. Schroder decided that she and herself could participate in the presidential company.
"This wasn't a very good planned solution," she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates, and I was totally unnecessary.
Someone called this situation "Black Snow and seven Gnomes."
Since the company has been going for a long time, she hasn't had any funds, so she said she wouldn't participate in the elections unless she won't win $2 million.
It was a lost situation.
It turned out that some of her fans, who sacrificed $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do you think I'm going with a discount?" she said.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election company, her emotions were so severely ashamed – thanks to the people who supported her, anger on the system that so complicated the gain of money and sex directed to voters – the anger and not the anger of me.
“You could think that my nervousness was shocked,” Mr. Schroder reminded the press reaction to her condition.
“It was possible to think that my corporate sponsor is a manufacturer of Kleenex paperwork.
I've ever thought that they're going to write on my overwhelming stones.
"She's crying?"
Why trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first waves of trade war between China and the U.S. were agglomerated, and since war is far from the end, far-reaching uncertainty between countries can be in the benefit of Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot with the first warning at the beginning of this year, covering main export goods in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new tariffs closed goods to a total of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually covering half the tax of goods occurring in the U.S. from China.
Each time Beijing has responded, it has recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent per U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised a symmetric response to the United States, and the second largest economy will increase.
In order to force Washington to resign, it is necessary to deepen the demand, but public decision before the U.S. is practically unacceptable for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that when Beijing correctly uses the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in a far-reaching perspective could support China by reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a quick political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start the process of short economic depression is much more dangerous than the observers have previously considered by the New York Times," said Eagle Grays, a researcher-seeker, researcher-scientist.
Syria's "committee" to returning refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria says she's ready to return refugees and calls for help to build a country destroyed by a war that lasts over seven years.
In turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Muale said the conditions in the country were improved.
“Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas broken by terrorists to return to a normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and targeted economic measures that have been aimed at improving their daily life and means of life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people who live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muhammed said the Syrian regime would be happy to help build a ruined country.
However, he stressed that the country will not help in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that have sponsored foreigners.

It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to get the cup back.

Woods has lost all four mothers in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 in the Rider Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 main titles and stands out for this indicator only from Jack Nicholas.
The American team struggled with itself for the exception of Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finov, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fury said after a delightful game in defending his team: "I'm jealous of these guys, they're boys.
This morning, we sometimes showed Europe what they were able to do.
We fought.
Let's pick up the caps for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Rider Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm surprised that I'm their captain.
Take a cap before them.
We're crossed."
