Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "passing for marionnets"
Deputy of the Welsh Parliament (Deputy of the Welsh Parliament, Deputy of the Gallois Parliament) (MWP) (Deputy of the Welsh Parliament, Deputy of the Welsh Parliament) (MWP) (Deputy of the Welsh Parliament) (MWP).
This proposal is derived from the draft amendment to the name of the assembly, which would become the Parliament of Gallos.
In the political sphere, Members of the Assembly think that this could be subjected to railroads.
A worker elected indicated that his group is concerned about the fact that the sigle "rides with Twp and Pwp".
For readers non originating in Galles: in Galles, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotch.
According to one of his members, Plaid Cymru (Parti del Pays de Galles) no 'satisfied' y proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be "open" to a change of name, but he noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionnette), distance is narrow.
In this context, in gallois, letter w pronounces as letter u in English from the region of Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which currently prepares legislation introducing the change of name, stated that "the final decision on the nomination of members of the Assembly returns to those".
The 2007 Law on Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act of 2017) gives the Galles Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission publicated the results of a public consultation on the proposal to appoint Parliament as Parliament of Gallo, which was also widely supported.
Intitulation: Deputates of the Gallois Parliament (or WMP) (intitulation: Deputates of the Gallois Parliament (or WMP)) - intitulation: Deputates of the Gallois Parliament prefere MWP (intitulation: Deputates of the Gallois Parliament).
It seems that Members of the Assembly emittent other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could be a real headhead for Elin Jones, President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft law on the change of name in the coming weeks.
La legislation on reforms incorpore other changes in relation to the functioning of the assembly, in particular rules on exclusion of members and design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly shall take the final decision on the issue of the name during debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on the change of the country’s name
Macedonians will decide Sunday, and they will see that their country is called "República del Norte de Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised in a attempt to solve a contentious old country for several decades between the country and its Greek neighbor, where Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens insiste long ago on the fact that the name of Macedonia is a claim on its territory, and many times imposed veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, opposition to referendum, indicó, he wouldn't take into account the results.
However, partisans, like premier Zoran Zaev, maintain that change of name is only a small price to pay for joining EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in Difficulty, Saint Martin's Clocks Reduced to Silence
"Oh, boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. boss. bos

I think it's normal that the bars should be rarified.
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

But in the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will go well before the responsables think and this concerns: "Early or later, they'll return home off."
It adds that churches could be replaced by complexes of condominiums, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuarys of the neighborhood.
"People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be in abundance Whites who will hurry the shutdown of all the churches, because it's unlikely they'll become members of them," he insiste.
Prior to Harlem become a black metropole, White Churches built both churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.

Uno noir congregación, preaching around, entrushed the building.
Saint Martin Church was resumed by a black community under the leadership of Revelation John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street stores, one of the main streets in Harlem, where Blacks wanted to use or get promotion.
In 1939, a fire devastated the building, but Pater Johnson's Parisians were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
"Papa Johnson's son and successor to Saint Martin's Church, Revelant David Johnson, invoked fiercely the "clouds of the poor people".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, assigned him a whole other name: "a cultural treasure" and "a irreplaceable historical instrument."
It also mentions that it's the first carillon in the world played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago sat before the largest carillon of Riverside Church.
Mr Merriweather says Saint Martin has not replaced him.
During the past few months, many have been questioned about the removal of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the laic elite of the church on the one side, and the Episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the paroisial board, board of directors composed of laïc officers, informed the diocese that he was concerned that the latter would like to impose him the cost of running, although he didn't participate in recruitment of professionals.
Some parisies regretted lack of transparency from the diocese.

Peter Jones Collège after Holly Willoughby withdraw from a £11 million deal
Corroux of the star of Dragon's Den TV program, Peter Jones, after announcement of the withdrawal of animator Holly Willoughby from a contract of up to £ 11 million associated with his home decor brand, to dedicate himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the Truly interior decoration brand and accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the brand Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
Aged 37, animator of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, Dragon's Den star, angry, leaving their successful work of textile and interior decoration in the last minute, to dedicate himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the dear child of TV revealed, during a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the Commercial Empire of Dragon's Den star in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to 1,5 million sterling pounds, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their interior decorations and their decorations brand.
The Truly brand was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow actress, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the wealth of the animator estimate to £ 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram she left Truly, Jones jumped in private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
"Truly was from a distance one of Holly's priorities.
I am going to make sure his future in the next 2 decades.
"K". .. .. "
Nobody could imagine what would happen Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's headquarters is full of goods ready to be sold."
Experts think that the start of the animator of This Morning, which is among the most "bankable" celebrities in Britain, could lose millions of companies, due to major investments in products from cowboys or bubbles, clothing or interior items, and risk that presume launch retarded.
In addition, this could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, were close friends to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went together holidays, and Peter Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby should become brand ambassador for M&S and take place of Ant McPartlin as animator of I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source close to Jones said yesterday night he no wants to comment about his business activities.
The debate was good, but finally we love it.
Trump laughed at media that criticize him because of his comments that some consider “intangible for a president,” and to demonstrate so positive for North Korean leader.
“Porque President Trump ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́?
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"Kim Jong-un claimed favorable to hold a second meeting, after Trump nominated the first, which took place in Singapore in June, large step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations about this denuclearization are at the end of death.
More than 3 months after summit in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomatic leader Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday to global leaders in the UN General Assembly, there was no "relevant response" of the United States to the first measures of disarmament in North Korea.

In his speech of meeting Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“All things are okay with North Korea,” says President of North America.
“We rushed in the armed conflict.
"Millioner de personas wären killed.
Now we have a good relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting attempts, the release of refugees, and the remains of American military returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but rather than having 10 000 people who try to access this arena full of crack, there's just over 200 stand before me," he criticized.
Tsunami: Isle of Devastated Island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake, which rushed Lombok, the help of foreign non-governmental organizations was presumably not necessary.
More than 10 % of Lombok's population was disrupted, but no state of national catastrophe was decreed, condition required for the launch of international assistance.
"Desfortunately, they've many times clearly stated that they didn't want international assistance, which complicates a little things," regretted Sumbung.
While Save the Children organization creates a team to go to Palu, she still doesn't know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman of National Agency for Disaster Management, Mr. Sutopo, claimed that Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
In spite of the severity that he suffers constantly, the country lacks cruel means to take care of the caprices of nature.
Asylums have been arranged in Aceh, but they rarely occur in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been reported, no Syrian warning has responded to Palu, which certainly has contributed to human loss.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to the other is not simple.
Natural disasters make use of transport more complicated.
A hospital ship that was posted in Lombok to cure the victims is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the locations of the new catastrophe.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, placed the reform of the devastated infrastructure in the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable amounts to restore the roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds invoked the Government of Mr. Joko, who called for a representation in front of electorates next year.
The Indonesian head of state also underwent pressures associated with the persistence of interetnic tensions in the country, where members of majority Islamist practice their faith in a more conservative way.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives, and tens of thousands have been kidnapped from their homes, on the grounds of conflicts in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with malets, arcs and flippers and other rudimentary weapons.

Parliament: Cromwell Statue, last victim of a attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in the light of destruction acts, innumerable religious and cultural possessions of England, compiled by its puritan partisans, such as taliban fanatic.
Cromwell Society, however, judge Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and call it "revisionist attempt".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Cromwell Society, says, "Get to the current debate about the removal of statues, it was evident that Oliver Cromwell's building before Westminster Palace wouldn't be saved.
Cromwell didn't order or lead the iconoclasme during British Civil Wars.
It is probable that we have sacrificed his person for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent representation, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, proves of the consideration that we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us celebrate yet yet. "
Mr. Goldsmith said in Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, I mean, of course, monarchy.
The fact that this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that crashed in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognized figure that represents a side of fracture.
"Seeing as Lord Protector deserves also to be emphasized and memorized."

Brett Kavanaugh’s Prosecution Attracts More than 20 Million Television Viewers
"Brett Kavanaugh, candidate to Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused her of sexually aggression in the 80s, have been followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse persisted, broadcast services stopped their ordinary program on Friday to announce a theatre break: an agreement imaginated by Jeff Flake, senator of Arizona, to allow FBI to conducte investigations on accusations for a week.
Christine Ford, before the Senate Judiciary Commission, assured 100 % that Kavanaugh, under alcoholic effect, had supplied answers on the person of Kavanaugh and tried to remove his clothes during a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirada, also affirmed to be 100% sure that it never happened.
According to Nielsen’s report, the prosecution is likely to have a hearing of over 20,4 million people.
The company calculated number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Cifres of other channels broadcasting the process, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Plus, Nielsen non always manage to estimate the number of people watching TV in the office.
As a comparison, the trial has attracted as many worlds as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators have largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most viewed channel in the day of hearings, with an average of 5,69 million viewers.
ABC occupied the second place with a audience reaching 3,26 million.
Followed CBS (3,1 million), NBC (2,94 million), MSNBC (2,89 million) and CNN (2,52 million), always according to Nielsen.
The interests are not made once the audition is completed.
Flake was the center of the drama that played Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican Republican posted a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras revealed a scene in which senator is partially taken by demonstrators while he attempted to take ascensor to go to auditions of the Judiciary Commission.
Flake lacked eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of live interpelation.
Y una de las mujeres dijo: “No miren a otro, miren a mí”.
“Are you sure you believe that he says the truth?”
"You can have the power of many women, you can have the power of many women."
Flake notified before the lift doors were closed, that his office had published a declaration and that he would say more so during the commission session.
All cable and broadcast networks would cover the live session a few hours later, while the judiciary commission prepared to vote the procedure in order to advance Kavanaugh's nomination by the whole Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a week investigation should be conducted first by the FBI on the accusations made against the candidate, as minority Democrats claim.
Flake left partly convinced by discussing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.

His choice was heavy in balance, because Republicans wouldn't have achieved votes that wouldn't allow Kavanaugh's nomination without a priori survey.
President Trump authorized FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s accusations of sexual abuse.

Dolly Menga’s First Goal: Livingston Wins
Livingston's team was surprised by the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 matches to Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal did all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to sit in 2nd position of ranking, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are free from victory outside Premiership League this season, and must face the Hearts team Sunday, which leads 8 points.
But before, Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna during the Europa League this Thursday.
Livingston's team, she prolonged 6 matches her invasive course in division, and Holt's main coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller since last month, maybe she might be sure that she's not lost the least match yet.
Livingston has lost an opportunity to excited opponents
Holt's team could have taken ahead long before marking, because their direct approach would make the Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson attempted to persevere but remained laid in front of the adverse goal; followed Alan Lithgow's late intervention, on Craig Halkett's head pass.
Livingston's team allowed the Rangers to possess the ball, knowing that she could bother them thanks to tactics that worked.
That's where the decisive goal was intervened.
Rangers took a free hit and Livingston attempted a opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to capture Menga, who took a touch and wrote a goal of the midfield.
In this stadium, Rangers dominated the game, but they found themselves faced an impenetrable defense, and the goal guardian Liam Kelly was rarely concerned.
The second half-time knew the same ritme, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to arrest.
Rangers Guard Allan McGregor stopped a Scott Pittman hit, while Lithgow managed to dejour one of Livingston plans.
The Livingston Guard respained all attempts and protected his cage, while two penaltys were rejected by the arbitrator, one for provoking Halkett against Glenn Middleton and the other for a hand error.
" fenomeno" de Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont de BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and amazing results for Livingston.
All of them are sober, they are sober, they are sober, and they are sober, and they are sober, and they are sober.
Their style and team composition have virtually not changed since their return to summit, but the merit returns largely Holt because since his arrival motivated a team
It's a lot of great players.
The defence of Captain Halkett was great and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall as a rabbit throughout the game.
Dearly, the Rangers weren't inspired.
Although a good level reached with Gerrard, they weren't at the top of their talents.
They missed the ultimate occasion, and they managed to find the adverse side only once; it's a warning for Rangers, who are in the middle of the picture.

The Kanye West rapper is now called Ye.
He wrote: "Anciently known as Kanye West."
West, 41-year-old, who has been named Ye for some time, has used this name as a title for his eighth album, released in June.

US should double finance in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding dedicated to research in this sector, according to investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These declarations occur after several actors of the U.S. government made announcements about IA, while an official IA strategy in the United States failed.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in IA innovation by 2030.
"Doppeling funds for research in the field of IA would be a good start because all other countries have a long advance on the United States, and we are looking for the next great discovery in IA," Lee.
Duplicating the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of IA, which defeated American Othello player best ranked. He then integrated Microsoft Reasearch management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in tech contests organized by the United States Government, such as Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and has asked when the next competition will take place, to identify visionaires.
According to Lee, American researchers often need to work hard to get funding from the government.
"It's not China that approves the university leaders, it's the businesses," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recruited major university names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also support US efforts involving AI.
"I think the green cards should be automatically given to researchers in IA," he said.
China State Business Council revealed its plan of development of artificial intelligence new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China gives funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but quality of academic work in China is weaker," explained Lee.
Earlier in the year, Department of Defense of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve partners in the industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, according to it, currently invests more than $100 million per year for research in IA.
In parallel, the US legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.

The working party is no longer a great community than it was.
It's not tolerable for those who express their ideas
"When activists of Momentum Movement of my local partition voted for me censur, it wasn't a surprise.
I'm the last of a line of parliamentarists of the Workers Party who are regarded as not welcomed, all this to express our ideas.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she resisted anti-semitism.
I was censored because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, it is the importance of economic policy responsible, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, it is the subjects for which Jeremy himself was disobedient to previous leaders.
The notification for the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Friday said: "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
That's exactly what the General Assembly of Friday's evening during my eight years as parliamentary of the Labour Party.
Desafortunately, today this is not the case of many meetings and the promise of policy more delicate and respectable has been forgetted for a long time, if it never been taken into account.
It became evident that contradictions no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged according to its acceptability by the leaders of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy's adoption of power. Collegas, with whom I thought to share the same political vision, started to wait from me to return my pants and to take positions opposed to my beliefs, whether it concerns national security or EU internal market.
Every time I talked publicly, and no matter what I said, I was following a miserable shooting on social media, calling for withdrawal, denounced politics of the center, saying to myself that I shouldn't be a member of the party.
And that's not only my experience.
I'm more happy than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were given to me were political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a disgusting sexist or racist speeches everyday, but who no lost their hands.
One of the most deceiving things in the current policy is normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Worker Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is limited to the moves of deficiency and changes to the rules of selection.
I have given a much advice these two years ago: tolerating the eyes, not expressing my opinions so strong, and everything would be good.
But it's not the same thing I do with politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, because ignorance of the Government of Thatcher caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I wanted to work for better public services for those who need it, whether as a local consultant or minister of government.
I've never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
Nottingham East nobody could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current leaders of the party.
All I would like to say to those who defended the movement Friday, is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect households, corporations, and services public. I think it's really not time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to leader of the party.
Nottingham Momentum isn't my only message, it's for my electors, whether they're working or not: I'm proud of serving you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will impede me to act for reasons I defende, which are your interests to everyone.
Chris Leslie is parliamentary for the district of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remain invasive
Due tests later may have falsified the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr merited this triomphe after intense match day of Scotland's rugby Championship to XV.
The team now holds the top of the ranking and becomes the only invasive team of the championship.
Ultimately, it's the superiority of their defense and the way they are caught the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
Y dijo: Hasta el día de hoy, hemos sido testados; pero no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Robyn Christie, Melrose, said Ayr: "Thank them, they were more effective than us, and they knew the chances."
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in good position, but a yellow carton for Scotland's escadron Rory Hughes, released for the match by Warriors, permitted Melrose to talk the numbers. Jason Baggot took care of a non-transformed test.
Climo has aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just half-time. He marked and transformed a solo essayi to lift score to 17-5 for Ayr at pause.
Melrose well started the second half-time, and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Seguint a longe expectation due to severe injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a civil. During the resumtion, Ayr resumed the front with a Stafford McDowall test transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's interim captain, then received a yellow carton, and Melrose again tried his chance with a non-transformed test by Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team returned to his hands, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow carton for having touched Climo while he had no ball, from the penalty key, MacPherson touched the back of the Ayr maul, which progressed.
Climo transformed the test, like almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent axial Gregor Henry to the remote for the fifth test of the team at home.
Still Game Star Starts in the restoration
Ford Kieran, Still Game star, decided to make a career in restoration. The comedian was appointed director of a company of restaurants under license.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis incarnated in the famous BBC show, which he wrote and coanime with his long-time partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the nineth series that will come will be the end of the show. And Kiernan seems to prepare for post-Craiglang.
According to official registers, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, though a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to engage in the "flowing environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"Sea is to us": Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patroudir in a boat blinded in La Paz General Naval District.
The public buildings rushed a blue flag like the ocean.
From the lake of Titicaca to the Amazônia, the bases of the ship, the following motocicleta: "The sea returns to us.
“Recuperation is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia blocked, memory of a lost coast for Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is always well present. Just as the desire to navigate over the Pacific Ocean, again.
Bolivia, de facto, expecto decision de International Court of Justice, which will be issued 1 October, 5 years after discussion.
"Bolivia has a will, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and, naturally, expects a positive result," says Roberto Calzadilla, diplomat boliviana.
Independent Bolivia will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on Large Screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will pronounce Bolivia request. Bolivia wish that, after decades of negotiations sporadical, Chile must negotiate agreement of a sovereign transition to ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be made Monday.
"We're so close to be able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
But some analists think that there's little probability that court pronounced for Chile. And that little things would change, even in case positive decisions.
The United Nations instance based in the Netherlands has no power to give a territory of Chile, and has stated that it would not determine the result of possible talks.
The fact that International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "not was complicated", says Paz Zárate, chili expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have damaged him.
"Problem access to the sea was detoured by the current bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales's bellican retorica knew all the good Chilean will that remained, she sugered.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very difficult to organize discussions.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in Haag, rejected the idea that decision-making of the Court was abnormally rapid.
"Lundi will bring Bolivia "a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "finance 139 years of disobedience with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also contested the fact that Morales - which remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political bequila.
"Bolivia never will abandone its right to access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
“The decision of the Court is a chance to see that we must take away the past.”

If you want to add XXL parts to your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun to 100%, do not search anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne creators presented their collections of oversize delicious hats during a PE19 show that honored the style of Fashion Week de Paris.
All extravagant hats each other than others invaded Instagram this summer, and creators decided to integrate their delicious pieces in the showcases.
Valentino's light piece was an excentric beige chapel decorated with a large bord, evoking a plume, which engluttered the head of mannequins.
Other accessories oversize included paste de jewelry walled, a chapel de magia, and even a ananas. But these parts were not thought to keep you warm.
Thom Browne has also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
The majority of masques had buzas cuss and said more Hannibal Lecter than High-Couture.
One creation was like a craftsmanship, with tuba, and eyelashes, while the other was thinking about a ice cube.
And if you follow mode trends, then you have lucky.
Depending on the style observers, the imposants hats could come to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the sillage of the Bomba, the wideboard pallet hat that the stars climb, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this chapeau hard portable, which inundated social networks, presented another of its creations phara on the podium: a beach bag in pallet nearly as big as the mannequin in bath t-shirt that weared it.
The orange raffia sack, adorned with raffia frankins and a white leather handbag, was the masterpiece of PE19 Riviera de Jacquemus Riviera de Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of celebrity Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags come in shops for next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is evident that there will be demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland Independent Schools maintain a dossier of excellence school. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent examination results strengthened by collective and individual success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
" ".............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, career they have chosen, and their place as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education capable of designing and establishing an over-measurement school program, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desired matters in schools.
Nelson Mandela dice: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
if if if, if, you, you, in in his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his
This reminds us that we can't trust ourselves in English to create relationships and establish a trust relationship with residents of other countries.
If we look at the excellent results in the examination this year, we find that languages are above ranking, with the most important success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 % of students who studied foreign languages received the highest rating, A.
The data collected from 74 schools of SCIS, show that 72 % of the students received the highest rating, A, mandarin, as well as 72 % of the students who studied German, 69 % of the students who studied French and 63 % of the students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as skills absolute essential for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as matters are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in programs of independent schools and other schools.
A British Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 survey reveals that 17 % of the difficulties of employers to recruit candidates are associated with insufficient language skills.
So language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
With more jobs that need languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
No matter his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this durable skill.
The power to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person before its competitors.
According to a YouGov survey conducted in 2013 from 4000 adults residents in UK, 75% of them didn't master a foreign language enough to chat. French was the only language spoken by a double number percentage (15%).
That's why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, in particular those of the emerging economies, children will have better chances to find a favorable job.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Several of them will concentrate on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the United Kingdom in 2020, including mandarin or japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialist staff in this field.
Scotland's independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, no matter what the future reserves for them.
It is evident that, in a global trade environment, languages remain crucial for the future of the country. This must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scotland youth.
Dee, dee, dee.

Trump Campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump will start a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stairs, particularly in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the President is popular, are planned.
Trump seeks to collect support for the next half-mandate elections and prevent the Republicans from losing control of Congress during the vote in November.
What hour is Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you look at it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 (ora East) this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of hearings of candidate in Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual abuse, which took place this week. Voting confirmation of Kavanaugh in Senate should be delayed until a week during FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims first of all to help Republicans win the ground in November elections.
According to Reuters, President of North America said hence in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to “encourage volunteers and partisans, while Republicans try to protect and extend majorities they hold in Senate and Chamber of Representatives”.
"Congress control is such essential element of his program that President will be able to the largest number of states in this early election campaign charged," said a spokesman of Trump team Reuters, who refused to be nominated.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the meeting of this evening, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena de Wheeling, could gather partisans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh."
Saturday, it will be the second visit of Trump in a month in West Virginia, a state that he won in 2016 by over 40 percentage points.
Trump attempts to help Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate to West Virginia Senate, who is in the trail in the surveys.
“Not good sign for Morrisey that President must come to try to rebuild it in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, specialist in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States Team is ready to fight to maintain hope to approach simple Sunday
After three simple, Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represente what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The Balancing Movement of the Eleanor is a sportive concept invented by all pieces, but in which the players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments like this.
"Where would they put Elan now?"
"They took six points forward and now four, so this gives us a little wings," said Jordan Spieth, while he was leaving for the day.
Europa has, of course, advantage, with 4 front points and 12 others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel like they have a little wind in a bubble and have all the reasons to be encouraged, in particular Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together the whole day and can be sure to get each three points of four.
Spieth proved that tee was very effective to green and gave an example.
Energic joy shouted as his game progressed. A crucial put allowed him to equate the fourth part while Thomas and him were brought down two holes after two holes.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91>
“Non, we really need to stay determined and concentrate on his game,” Spieth said.
It's all that each of these players remains now.
18 holes.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as testifies the story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European couple won 4 matches per 4 and has no right to error.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones who didn't realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, Friday afternoon, and in the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, how their energy appears to circulate between them and the crowds to delicious them designate them as players to fight Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari whose potential European victories are awarded while the sun sets on the Gulf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
But it's not that it's just the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson rapidly bat Sergio Garcia, heroes of fourballs of the morning, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots have sent Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they never could go out.
Nobody is here Sunday to help you.
The fourballs and the foursomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of interacciones between couples, advices they give and those they don't give, and how a strategy can bassate into a clinch of eye.
Europe has played better as team so far and has taken a considerable advance in the last day, but this foursome session has also demonstrated that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, particularly in the country.
Europe takes 10-6 in the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit solid advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after having won 10-6 on the United States during fourballs and foursomes Saturday.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took charge with two victorys on a Tiger Woods in trouble, which allowed them to mark four points so far.
Desired well to preserve the title she lost at Hazeltine 2 years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European Team made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning fourballs, faced with a disturbed American team.
USA demonstrated greater resistance in foursomes and wond two victories, but they couldn't absorbe the distance.
Jim Furyk's men must necessarily score eight points in 12 Sundays during the simple to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruitor to recruit four affiliate points, while Molinari and he, named "Moliwood" after a week-end failing, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup history to get four points during their first four matches.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat flat wheat pair composed of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already fatigued by a 5 and 4 even more categories.
Woods, who trampled during the two matches of Saturday, flashed several times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven affiliates.
Justin Rose, well-packed for the fourballs in the morning, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and third in the world ranking.
Europe wasn't spared during the tournament that took place in Southwest Paris, under a fresh but free time.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas triplicate winners set the reference for Americans marking two points Saturday.
Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm won a 2-1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, who lost their first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team recovered from a four-point difference in simple, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, had only to make no match to preserve his trofee.

North Korea declares that disarmament will not be able in "no case" to be unilaterally unconfidenced.
Saturday, North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated to the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen his misconfidence with the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally abandon his nuclear arms under these circumstances.
Annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho affirmed that North Korea last year had taken "important measures of good will ", such as those to stop nuclear tests and missiles, detemplate site tests nucleares, and its commitment to not spread arms and nuclear technology
"Maither, we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in the same circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to unilaterally disarma ourselves."
Northern Korea's well-known protests about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach of denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if gradually took measures, a declaration of North Korea's important manifested in that it was not rejected the idea of a unilateral denuclearization.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made 12 June in Singapore during the first summit between a US President and a North Korean leader, when Kim promised to work for a "denuclearization of Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to formally end the Korea War (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to sustain severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States insiste on North Korea first denuclearization and intensifice pressure imposing sanctions to achieve their goal coercitively, opposing even "deklaration of end of war"".
“Anybody who thinks that these sanctuarys can punish us, they don’t know us.
"Problem is that keeping sanctions increases our infidelity."
Ri has not commented on the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader has exerted before the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, and added: "If the part involved in the question of denuclearization was South Korea, and not the United States, denuclearization of Korean Peninsula would not be in such a impasse."
Nevertheless, the ton of Ri speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had stated before the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point the North Korean missiles to the territory of North America after the "malfious" President Trump called Kim "man's missile" in suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened before UN before the United Nations to "destroy entirely" North Korea, did not apologize this year on the courage with which Kim implemented measures to implement a disarmament, but added that there remains much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmament.
Trump affirmed Wednesday, Trump affirmed, "That could take two years, three years, or five months, but that's not important", he affirmed.
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
Mike Pompeo, secretary of State of America, deklarated on Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: "Implementation of Sanctions of the Security Council must be firm and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to intensify financing of Pyongyang nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in marge of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has travelled 3 times in North Korea, but his last trip was a little disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang affirming that progress had been achieved, but, in the following hours, North Korea denounced its "metodes of gangster".
"During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to demontage a site of missiles as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to South Korean President, Kim claims the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take lessons of rest
This year, Harvard University has established a new course that allows all first-class students to sleep more and fight against growing machiste trend consisting of studying consuming caffeine throughout the night.
A professor noted that the majority of students from the best university in the world can't take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of the genre in the United States.
It's after giving a conference on the effects of sleep privatization on learning that the idea came to him
"After the end, one of the students approached me, and said to me, "Why do we say this to me only last year?"
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Dispensed for the first time this year, this course explains students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their well-being in general.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered serious sleep shortage during the week.
The time of the course consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a bedroom containing various items (caffee cups, rides, baskets, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performances and the importance of integrating routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term deficit of sleep may increase the risk of heart attack, aVC, depression, and cancer.
A campus map containing interactive icons then invite participants to think about their daily routine.
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information - just as you have the right to know what the impact of tobacco on health," said Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of “passing a white night” still exists, and it adds that modern technology and constantly growing pressure exercised on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
The fact that having enough sleep and good quality should be "the secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, as deficiency of sleep puts the brain in a mode of extinction, making them hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and forced him to insist that it might be offered to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to propose to all graduate students to follow a similar program of studies before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to provide alarm both for the time of bed and for the time of awakening, and to be aware of the adverse effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can impair their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
Rangers suffered a new hard strike outside, Dolly Menga's attack led Steven Gerrard's desarticulated team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team hoped to record his first victory in the move since his 4-1 triumphant in February to St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as coach, leaving his team at the derivative, 8 points behind Hearts, leading Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and Rangers' team, shortly inspired, couldn't justify.
While Rangers now falling in sixth place, Livingston lifted in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could make it feel for Rangers, Calum Spence arbitrator who had to be treated for a head injury after a jet of object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which scanned Ayr in the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, picked the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at Hearts last week and would have been excited to see that his well trained team was turbulent adversaries in each turn.
Rangers maybe controlled the ball, but Livingston made it more.
They should have scored for two minutes, when Menga's first shooting sent Scott Pittman for the purpose of Allan McGregor, but the middle of the ground let's pass his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful shot towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his team defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second poll
Rangers managed to take control, but it seemed that there was more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos believed that he certainly should have benefited from a penalty after the frank strike when Steven Lawless and he went into collision but arbitrator Steven Thomson rejected Colombian claims.
Rangers only benefited of two shots in the first period, but Ibrox's ex-guard Liam Kelly, was hardly troubled by Lassana Coulibaly and a shot of Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening score at the 34th minute has been registered against the game course, no one can negate that they deserved it for their hard work.
Again, Rangers failed in front of Jacob's foot strike.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher remitted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a finish while in simplicity.
Ge Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Gerrr react react react Hal Hal Hal Hal Re Re Re Re Re Hal Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Ger Gerrard re re re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re the the the the the the the the the the the the the the.......... and the the the the the the the........................ the the the the the the the the the the when when when when when when when when when when
Livingston still continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett shaking long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor had a good deal to rebuild Jacobs before Lithgow went ahead of the goal.
The Rangers replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty in the end of game while he was in the play with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanach : The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOUR COMPUTER... was born future physicist Johannes Wilhelm " Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity; a invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger Counter.
Pilar of Science from then, the Geiger Counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as you can see in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two improbable scientists:
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Rogers: "Est Geiger Counter, we use it to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, we can actually hear the effects of atoms liberated in minerals by radioactivity."
"Evans: 'Say me!'" "Evans: 'Say me!'"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that brings its name is a place.
New Cancer Vaccine allows the immune system to "decele" cancer cells
New Cancer Vaccine allows the immune system to “detemplate” cancer cells and kill them
In the case of treatment, vaccine indicates the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and transforming them into laboratory.

Un experimental vaccine shows stimulant results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to learn from the immune system how to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappearing for over 18 months.
The method consiste en extracting immune cells from a patient and transforming them into laboratory, so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-injection them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Institute of Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Prof. Berzofsky, protein HER2 "produce increase in several types of cancers", inkl. breast cancer, ovarium, pulmonary and colorectal.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells for their "learn" targeting cancer cells, proved in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

HIV / SIDA: China Reports Increase 14% New Cases
China reported a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS populations.
According to Chinese sanitary authorities, more than 820 000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter 2018.
The majority of the patients were infected during sexual relations, which is a new fact.
Historically, virus spread rapidly in some regions of the country due to transfusions of kontaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was practically reduced to zero, affirmed Chinese sanitary authorities during a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, in China, from one year to another, the number of seropositives and AIDS-patients increased by 100 000.
In the LGBT community of China, transmitting HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was penalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Numerous transfers are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese Government has promised since 2003 universal access to drugs against HIV.
Maxine Waters denied that GOP employees revealed data about senators, and denominated "Dangerous Lies" and "Complot Theories".
Saturday, American Republican Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to the legislator.
The Los Angeles Democrat affirmed that these statements were supported by experts and websites "extreme right".
“Løgns, løgns, and yet infinite løgns,” reager Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It seemed like the information disclosed understood addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee, Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was online on Thursday by an étranger in Capitole Hill during Senate session on allegations of sexual aggression against candidate in Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape occurred a while after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that IP address that identifies source of messages was associated with Waters Office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "This non-funded argumentation is totally false and a false absolute."
“Membres of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false claims, in no case is responsible for evasion of this information.”
“This false argumentation is totally fals and true falsehood.”
Waters' Declaration has promptly raised criticism online, including by Ari Fleischer, ancien adhesive of the White House Press.
“Este negation de anger”” (Sant.
“Ay, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
It shouldn't be provocative.
The accused is not to blame the causes of the accused.
"Everything must be peaceable, and peaceable."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticisms against judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too furious during Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-mandate elections, also reported his comments on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” wrote he on Twitter.
Waters notified in his statement that his office had warned "autorities and services responsible for the application of the relevant laws" about these fraudulent claims.
"We'll ensure that the criminals are devastated," she added, "and that they'll be responsible for all their acts destructors and dangerous for all members of my team."
Johnny English again hit. Parodie de Rowan Atkinson, spio subdue
It has now become a tradition of searching for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resumtion of action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed surface in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
The ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the evidence of our insignificance will represent the new chance of exporting from our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with the eyes and with the face of rubber, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicates before all that it's a great comic creation designed for a non-anglophone audience cinéphile.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, in spite of his suspicious attempts of glamourous charmer, has a little Clouseau, a suspicion Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a little note in Fire Chariots during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV ads, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two sympathetic moments.
I liked Johnny English coming close to a helicopter while he was carrying a medieval armband, and rotor's pales hit shortly against his cascade.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely excessive, particularly when "severe" licenses like 007 and Mission impossible make themselves fully trusted with comedy.
Humor seems more oriented towards children than towards adults, and for me, Johnny English's aventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's mute film gags in Bean's character.
The first of the current news is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great destruction of agents in service - a slightly low-envergure role for Kevin Eldon.
"It's the gout that make the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character in the edge of the crisis and who already suffers of political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives best of himself with this character near-Teresa-May, but there's no great thing to put himself under the dent in the scenario.
Assuredly, the advisors of his/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/her/
This means that you must bother Johnny English itself, which is now employed in a chic institution as a master of school, but which secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some beautiful fars here, because English offers a Rock Academy way spion academy.
English is returned to Whitehall for a emergency information meeting and find Bough, his former long-haired partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, associated with a submarine commander, a fun hockey balloon role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin, who create enormous anxiety in secret services of His Majesty, move to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatale woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the imprisonment of the charismatical technological billionaire who says capable of solving the IT problem of Britain: Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of farfeluous jokes: under the decoration of servers, they place fire in a French restaurant that shine; they create chaos by fading on the luxurious Volta vessel; and English starts a real anarchie when it attempts, with a hood of virtual reality, to familiarize itself with Volta house.
All arrestations are secured for this last sequence, but in spite de todo, there's nothing bad for children in all this.
Film moderate.
"I'm not able to stop thinking, like Johnny English's other films: the British cinema industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really values his talent?
Labour Party refused to plan for brits to work four days but to pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Worker Party must examine a radical plan that will allow Brits to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to make the workers benefit from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leisure.
This would allow employees to enjoy a week-end of three days while continuing to touch the same salarie.
Según some sources, the idea would agree with the economic programme of the party and the plans of orienting the country for workers.
The passage to a week of four days was approved by Congress of Trade Unions as a means for workers to benefit from economic changes.
One important source in the Working Party said to Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not happen in a night, but a week of work of four days is a goal that will coincide with the approach of the party to rebalance the economy for workers and with its global industrial strategy."
The Working Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party committed to a four-day working week during its general election campaign of 2017.
However, this aspiration for the moment is not supported by the Working Party as a whole.

Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell profited from the working conference last week to give details about his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell is committed to regain power from the hands of "anonim administrators" and "profits" in public utility companies.
The plans of the supplent Chancellor also provide that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover all their deposits, as the labourist government could operate "deductions" due to presumed deductions of conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan of integrating workers into corporate management boards, as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of private corporate capital to employees, which will empoke up to £ 500 dividend per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy trust "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their opinion.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to Supreme Court was delayed at least a week after FBI's investigation into accusations against him and raises the question of whether Bureau's conclusions could motivate Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, correspondent of the 60 Minutes program, asked senators republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his companion of South Carolina.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"Immediat, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando, spadando.
I'll call him after that, when these accusations were formulated, and I asked him, "What did you do?"
It was resoluted, determined, irrevocable.”
However, Graham's vote seems to be gravated in the stone.
"I've done my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and I'd need a explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's happening, but I know this: Brett's noted it categorically," added Graham, alerting Christine Blasey Ford.
"Ella nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata nominata

US could call for Marine to create a "blocus" to impede russ energy exports - secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from coming to markets, including Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" call to American Navy, according to Ryan Zinke, US Interior secretary, citated by Washington Examiner.
Zi Zi Zi Zi Zi Zi Zi Zi Zi said said said said that that that that that Russia Russia Russia Russia in Syria Syria - - - - - - - - particular particular, where, where, act act - - - - - - on on - - - - on - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - it Zin Zi it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it to to to to to explore explore explore explore in new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy in new new new new new new energy energy energy energy energy energy in in in
"I think they're in Middle East in order to negotiate energy like they're doing in East Europe, South Central Europe", he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"United States can, together with our Marine, ensure that maritime pathways are open and, where necessary, impediment, to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed participants to the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "Energy Consumer spokesperson" in the United States.
He has compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually the same.
"In Iran and Russia, economic option resides in operational and replacement of fuels", - he said, while referring to Russia, saying, "it owns "more than one cord to its arc" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These declarations arrive at the time when the Trump administration se comprometed to dinamize exportation of its gas natural liquid to Europe, replacing Russia, a much less costable solution for consumers in Europe.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to come out of the "inadequate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin city "prisoner" in Moscow.
"Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth 11 trillion dollars, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 trillion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin states that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and constitutes an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in September in Moscow after a meeting with Rick Perry, the secretary of Energy of the United States, the Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Novak said: "I think we share this opinion that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has caused negative reactions by Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Industries Federation (BDI), invited the United States not to engage in the European energy policy or bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interfiere in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

18 States and District of Columbia are favored a judicial contestation of the new asylum policy
18 States and District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial contestation of the new US policy which refuses asylum to victims flipping a gang or violence domestic.
Friday in Washington, representatives of 18 states and districts have filed a memory for a asylum seeker who contested this policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against Federal Policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner "y her sons, members of violent gangs", had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum request on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors, who support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, who generate abundance of asylum requests in the United States, as countries faced widespread problems of gangs and conjugal violence.
The new US asylum policy canceled a decision made in 2014 by the immigrant appeal Council, which allowed illegal immigrants to escape conjugal violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, Prosecutor General of Columbia District, said Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignore decades of state law, federal and international law."
"The federal law states that all asylum requests must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such prohibition violas this principle", he said in his memory, amicus curiae.
Lawyers also affirmed in memory that the policy of refusing to enter immigrants harms the economy of America, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary job".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims who escaped conjugal violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is awarded people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear due to racial, credibility, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or convictions politics," Sessions, 11 June, said in announcement of the policy.
"Asylum nunca fuerced, so asylum, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia."

US Ambassador accuse China de "intimation" via "propaganda ads"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper spended a four-page advertising glorious mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in a US newspaper, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump said Wednesday Wednesday that China Daily paid the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling journal in Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US parlamentary elections on 6 November, an accusation that China refute.
Trump, accusing Beijing of wanting to intervene in the US elections, noted what US officials said Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it's common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that led them to apply mutual tariffs to their import.
In the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were intended to strike exporters of states like Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China, and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and American companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a commentary article published in The Moines Register of Sunday, "it is in duplication of its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press in our own free press."
"In the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of press by inserting a payable advertising in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in Beijing's press press, you'll find little controversial voices and you'll not see the real reflection of divergente opinions that Chinese may have on the problematic economic pathway of China, because the media obey firmly the Chinese communist party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying any newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans Alienate Electrics to Approach Half Mandate Elections Due to Kavanaugh Debug
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to Supreme Court in context of assertions of sexual aggression, analysts have warned that negative reaction, particularly in women, could occur during the next half-mandate elections.
Emotions surrounding this affair were extremely live and most Republicans have shown publicly that they wanted voting could take place.
In an article published 29 September in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said "we cannot return back."
Reeher added that he doubted that last minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for a FBI investigation are sufficient to calm down voters' anger.
Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and National Speaker of the MoveOn Progressist Group, according to Karine Jean-Pierre, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget what happened tomorrow, and they will not forget it in November", she said 28 September, according to Washington newspaper.
" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " ".

"Entusiasmo and demokratic motivation will be demesurated," said Stu Rothenberg, non-partisan political analyst.
“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"But this could be even higher, particularly among electors of banlieues and among young electors 18-29 years old who, even if they don't like President, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public deposition explaining in detail the allegations of sexual aggression against the nomination of the Supreme Court, the analysts have made it possible to believe that the reaction would be alive if Republicans made the confirmation progress.
According to NBC News, former President of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "It became a confused desorden for GOP".
"It's not only vote of the committee or vote final, it's not only nomination of Kavanaugh, it's also the way the Republicans managed the situation and the way they treated it," noted Guy Cecil, director of Priorities of the United States, a group helping the elected democrats, a the TV newspaper.
According to Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, the Americans, however, seem divided about the credibility of both parties, a small majority of the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of the consulted people believed absolutely or probably the Ford testimonial, while 35% deklarated absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 % said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lying during his testimony, while only 30 % said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, FBI investigate Ford's argumentation and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that it was attacked by Kavanaugh while he was in a state of estate at 17 years old.
Ramirez argued that when they studied Yale in the 1980s, candidate to Supreme Court would have shown him his genital parts during a party.
World Wide Web inventor plans to lanse New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a whole new company that seeks to rival with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company that profits from Berners-Lee Solid Free Platform.

In an exclusive interview given Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt intended to "dominate the world".
“Nos ought to do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not
“That’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "business of personal personal data store" or DPL.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available simultaneously in one browser.
The particularity of the online store of personal data is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility via data".
According to CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company brings resources, processes, and skills appropriate to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working contract on the project and a community of voluntary codeders.
Since this week, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt website.
"Berners-Lee" said that his team and he are still not discussed with "Facebook and Google" to see if you need or not to operate a total change in total change where all their business models are completely changed in a moment.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission [d'Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem with a view to protecting integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, en Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed Internet creando World Wide Web Consortium.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee was a influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this new era of web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a Churchist of the First World War decorated by the Cross of Victoria
The only ecclesiastical of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior was celebrated in his birthday city 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later, and he did not know that he had gained the highest military distinction British.
His two uncles revealed a memorial stone during a break in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his uncles, claimed that he was "symbolicly brilliantly" to reveal the stone just 100 years after his grandfather's operation.
According to London Gazatte, 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his batallion on the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick browillard and under violent shooting of campaign canons and mitrailleuses."
Later, he crashed into the line of shooting and, with the "bigest braveness", led the line before he jumped a canon of camp to him alone, and threw three soldiers to take away.
On 4 October 1918, a German elite shooter killed Colonel Vann, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, affirmed that the acts of his grandfather were "a thing to the height of which I will never be, but which makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also posted a corona after the show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confessed that he felt "very honored to be part of the show" and added that "the courage of a true hero reflects in support that will be brought to him by many people."

A Twitter supporter described the passage to the animated drawing for children as "a sort of bad joke".
Dave Schwartz, Vice-President for Marketing and Communications at Bellator, said: "Regulation of the Government disposes that this content was inadaptable at 6:00 pm, so they have to go back to children's emissions."
“Papa the pork, yes. ”
Scott Coker, President of Bellator Company, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I believe that when I think of redifusion, I think that we probably can find a solution," - said Coker.
“Pero, it's six hours of a morning Sunday and we can't find solution before Sunday or Monday or their hour.
But we work there.
Believe me, when the program basculated, there were many messages in both directions, and they were not all friends.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a matter of government.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lower” in terms of sexuality
Tom Daley says that he has grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that has put him motivation to succeed.
24-year-old said that he didn't go to secondary school before he went to the secondary school that "everybody [was] not like me."
In the first broadcast of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presentated by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about the question of rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming parents made him less interested in gaining the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the ordinary broadcaster, took several months of leave due to her illness.
Daley admitted that he felt "menos" than all other children grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls to love boys and girls."
“Today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed for my success.”
In order to not lose away all the people when they finally learned the truth about their sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "almost something", he continued.
The double medal of the Olympic bronze is now a renowned LGBT militant and has benefited from his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to ask a larger number of countries to discriminate homosexuality.
"He said that he expressed himself, because he felt lucky being able to live openly without ramifications and that he thus wanted to return "hope" to others.
The triple world champion said that he "no [s]esperated" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, meeting in 2013
Daley married last year Oscar winner, 20 years old, but he said that age difference never was a problem.
"When we see so much things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later - he convinced that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who knew the same high and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspective" had changed.
"Si tu me interrogeas el año pasado, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
“Importunidades de oro olimpico.
"Mine gold medaille, Robbie."
Her son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011, aged 40 years after cancer of brain.
Daley confessed that his father did not accept that he would die and that one of the latest things he asked him was if they already had their tickets to London 2012, since he wanted to sit in first line.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"It's all that I dreamed about all my life - jumping in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there's nothing better than it," he said.
In addition, this inspired him his first choice of song - Proud de Heather Small - who had accompanied him during preparations for Olympics and always gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:00, BST.
A Mickelson out form on the bank of the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will perform a record this Sunday playing his 47th match of Ryder Cup, but he will have to retreat in order to prevent this from being a disastrous step.
Mickelson, Mickelson, who participated in the two-an-dual match for the 12th, a a record, was been been afraid from from the Captain Jim Furyk of the Four Fours and Foursomes and Foursomes of the Sa Sa Sa Sa Sa Sa.
Instead of being in the heart of action, as it so often was for the United States, the quintuple grand champion shared his day between the role of supporting and the skinfining of his game in stand in order to remedy his pains.
He never was the greatest leader ever, even at the top of his career. Age of 48 years, he is not the best suited for the difficult Golf National, where long rough systematically punit the sparked shots.
And as if the road wasn't scary enough in itself, Mickelson, in the 9th match of Sunday, confronted Francesco Molinari, British Open winners, who this week teamed with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 matches in simple, take a good start, Mickelson match might be absolute crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in the man, but he couldn't say anything else.
"Han fully understood the role he needed to play today, gave me a tape in the back, placed his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
« Abraham har så stor tillit i honom. »
He's a legendary champion and he's added a lot of things to these teams in the past, like this week.
I probably didn't see him play two matches.
I thought it better, but that's how it happened, and that's how we should go.
"He will be there, like all the others."
Sunday, Mickelson will win Nick Faldo record of the Ryder Cup's most controversial meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup, which never totally reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 demi, although Furyk affirmed that his presence brought concrete elements to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, spiritual, it's funny, it's lovely laughing people, and it's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed meditation this week, which was fun to see.
It’s much more than playing.”
European Selection Capitan Thomas Bjorn knows that the future might soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows by experience that an unnecessary advance before the simple of the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily transforme it into a regretable course.
Dance disputed his first match in Valderrama in 1997, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points in advance on Americans, but ultimately lifted up ranking with the smallest deviation possible on the line of arrival, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 .
"You don't stop reminding you that we were going largely to Valderrama; we had a big advance to Brookline, where we failed, as well as to Valderrama, where we won, but justice," Bjorn said, after the 2018 Classification observation to win 5-3 win wins both Friday and yesterday at National Golf to lead 10-6.
The story will prove to us, to me and to all the members of this team, that it's not the end.
I'll go deep down tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need.
It's not finished before you have the points in the picture.
"We have a goal, namely, trying to win this trofee, and that's where we need to stay focused.
"I always said that I would focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what's happening on the other side - they're the best players in the world."
Ravi's performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go on this point.
Tomorrow, c'est just a c'est a c'est a c'est a c'est a c'est a c'est a c'est a c'est a c'est a c'est a c'est a c
Tomorrow, these are individual performances that will be presented and it goes differently.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you've been tested up your full capacity as a golfer.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86>
"When someone leaves a partner behind him, he must go and take the best of himself, too."
Contrary to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will try to ensure that his players get better results individually than as co-teamers, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points in four.
Furyk himself knew the two ends of these revivals last day, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing after the "Miracle of Medinah Medinah", where Europa defeat victory.
“I remember every word,” he explained in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, had made to rally his players last day.
“We have 12 big meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this fast start like you saw it in Brookline, like you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, makes it weighing a lot of pressure on the median matches.
We have set our training accordingly, and set the guys as we thought should do, we try to make the magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has awarded himself the task of conducting the anti-attack and confronting Rory McIlroy in the first class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I've accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn said in his choices simple.

According to Die Zeit, who quotes a spokesman of a military spokesman, the operation of "Rheinland-Pfalz", amiral vessel of all new fragests from Bade-Wurtemberg, was deferred in the first semestre 2019.
The ship should have integrated Marine in 2014, but the alarming problems that occurred after delivery compromised the destiny of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Wurtemberg class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the Bremen class vessels.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful canon, a range of antiaerian and antinavir missiles, as well as some fusible technologies, such as radar signature, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frégats for a period of up to two years outside the ports of attachment.
According to Die Zeit, however, incessante delays mean that war-guardships - which should allow Germany to project its alien force - will already be obsolete when they are placed in service.
Last year, F125 maledette fregate made big titles when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and sent it back to Blohm & Voss Marine Factory, Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship manufacturer after delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship unnecessary in the event of deployment in combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because Bade-Wurtemberg class ships will be operated by a crew composed of about 120 marines, which corresponds to half of the old fregata crew of the Bremen class.
In addition, it seems that the vessel is largely overloaded, reducing its performance and reducing the ability of the Navy to bring future improvements.
The Rheinland-Pfalz of 7000 tons weighs twice as heavy as the same class ships used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the training of crew - becomes also a problem.
It is said that he reached the astronomic sum of 3,1 billion euros (3,6 billion dollars), versus 2,2 billion euros initially.
Problems involving new fregates are particularly important in light of recent alerts that Germany's marine force decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chief of Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is "in fact short of vessels capable of deploying itself."
The officer said that the situation produced a snowball effect with the time, because the old ships were deleted, but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of Bade-Wurtemberg's fregattens could join the Marine.
The National Trust Watches the Secret Life of the Chauves-Souris
New research carried out in a field of Scotland Highlands seek to reveal how the chauves-suuris use the landscape in their food search.

The study of researchers from National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipstrelles and sopranos, as well as long-ear brun chauves-souris, and Daubenton in Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places around the property to track the activities of chauves-suuris throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
Professional analysis of sound will allow you to determine the frequency of cries of chauves-souris, as well as the activities of different species.
A map and a report on habitat will be drawn up for a detailed table of their behavior in the territory.

This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management works, such as the creation of grooves, and the best way to preserve forests for souris and other species associated.
In Scotland and UK, the population of chaves-souris has declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect the perchoirs and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Wind and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as papers kill-mouth and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of company cats.

They use sophisticated ekolocalization technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight pathway.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, NTS takes the chauves-souris very seriously.
It has 10 expert trained, who regularly perform surveys, perchoir inspections and sometimes rescues.
In addition, the organization has established the first and only reserve of Scotland's chauves-souris on Threave's site in Dumfries-et-Galloway, which resides in eight of 10 species of Scotland's chauves-souris.
David Thompson, domain manager, states that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave," he said, "we have a perfect place for the souris, "we have a perfect place for the souris.
“We have old buildings, much old woods and all good habitat.
But still there remains much to learn about the sharks, so that the work we're doing here and in other places will help us better understand what the sharks need to prosper. "
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of chauves-souris before proceeding to maintain the property, because destructing without the desire of a single nide of maternity, thus, can cause the death of 400 females and young women, or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
Souris are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or to ruin their pearls.

Ronaldo rejects accusations of rape while his lawyer prepares to proceed with German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calificate accusations of violation against him as "fake information", and asserted that "people want to know themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is ready to proceed with German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating a American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would have paid him $375 000 to keep silent about this incident, according to Der Spiegel last Friday.
Having addressed 142 million fans in a live video posted on Instagram, a few hours after the release of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, calificed this information as "false information".
No, no, no, no, no, no.
"What they said today is a false information," said the quintuple laucer of Gold Ballon.
“They want to make a public using my name.
Oh, normal.
They want to be famous because they say my name, but it's part of the job.
"I'm a good man and everything's good," said the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s advocates are ready to proceed Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they call "inadmissible denomination of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz claimed that the player would demand compensation for "moral damages of an amount proportional to severity of infraction, which probably is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The suspected incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Hotel, Las Vegas.
After meeting each other in a night box, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rash would occur, according to documents deposited at Clark County Court, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo rushed after the presumed incident and assuranceed him to be a "good guy" at "99%" but he didn't know what happened to him with "1%" restant.
The documentation claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that these were consented.
Mayorga also argued that she went to police and that photographs of her injuries were taken in hospital, but she subsequently accepted a legalization to a friend because she felt "terrified by repressives" and feared "superiorized by public humiliation".
This woman of 34 years says that she is now trying to cancel this regulation, because she remains traumatized by the presumptuous incident.
Ronaldo was on the point of joining Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United during this presumed aggression, and this summer, he joined the Italian gigant Juve in the framework of a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK “will regrette eternal” the start of automakers.
According to Greg Clark, a secretary of State responsible for Commerce, UK "we would regret it forever" if she would just lose her status as global leader in auto construction after Brexit.
He added that it was “anxiety” that Toyota UK told BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its Burnaston factory near Derby, if Britain would retire from EU without agreement.
“We need a deal,” said Clark.
Japan Automobile Manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the possibility of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
Burnaston's factory - which produces Auris and Avensis Toyota's vehicles - constructed nearly 150,000 automobiles last year, 90% of which have been exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leave the EU at the end of March, the production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston.
Other British automobile manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreeing on the operation of transfronter trade.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The major concerns are about what automobile manufacturers call risks for supply chain in case Brexit is not agreed.
Toyota's production line is exploited in 'tendu flow', parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for customized vehicles.
"If 29 March, UK abandone EU without agreement, there could be disruptions in front of the border, which, depending on industry, could resulte in delays and deficiency of monede.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold the inventory more than a day at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers Plan for Future Relations with EU "is precisely kalibrated in order to avoid these controls at the border".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that, as I said, will allow not only to benefit from the success of the present, but also to take this opportunity," he said in Radio 4's Today streaming BBC.
"Obviously, not only Toyota, but other manufacturers, it is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has been shown to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to specify how long the production would stop, however, it warned that in the longer term, the additional cost would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, coordinator of the United Nations Association of Factory and who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience, once these jobs disappear, they never return."
"We have proposed a plan precise and credible for our future relations with EU."
The White House announced Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to an announcement made Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important challenges, between Donald Trump and Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "refunded by a week" while the struggle for candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Robert Mueller, Robert Mueller (Robert Mueller) and Rosenstein, Rosenstein, Rosenstein supervision of Robert Mueller (Robert Mueller), the Special Advisor of the Russian Federation of Russia (Robert Mueller), who is responsible for investigating Russia’s Russian interference in the elections in elections, the ties between Trump’s Trump’s and Russia’s collaborators, Trump’s and Russia’s and Russian Russia and the possible barriers of the justice and the justice of Russia.
The question of whether Trump will send back or not the Vice Prosecutor General, and thus will threaten Mueller’s independence, feeding the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about carrying a micro to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating President by 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these claims.
In the last Monday, however, he accedied to the White House while he was on the way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said that he would "better not" would "better" return Mr. Rosenstein, but meeting was delayed in order to prevent a confrontation with the hearing of Senate Judicial Commission, in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, a woman who accused him of sexual abuse.
Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed Senate vote.
Sunday, Trump's press attachment, Sarah Sanders, made a show to Fox News.
Asked about meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date was fixed for this, could be this week, I could see if we would still take a week back after all other things happening to Supreme Court.
"""""""" """"." """""."
Sept. 10, Sanders has not held press conferences in the White House.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rareness of conferences was not due to aversion for "demagogical" reporters of TV, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they explode the gallery."
Then she let hear that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President participate in more than any other President before him," he said: "We checked the numbers."
"Sanders, if the press has chances to question direct President of the United States, it's infinitely better than to talk to me.
"We try to do so often, you've seen it well in the past few weeks, and this will take place a press conference where you can talk to President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.

Foreign buyers will be subjected to a higher timing right if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher timber rights if they buy property in the UK and extra money will be used to help free homes in the framework of new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The increase in taxes will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling per year in order to help those who are away from home.
Foreign buyers will be subjected to a higher tax tax if they buy property in the United Kingdom - extra money will serve to help homeless, announces Theresa May today.
This measure will be seen as a initiative that will neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young electorates, engaging in providing more affordable housing and targeting people earning high income.
The increase in the right of the timing will be imposed on individuals and corporates who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will serve to strengthen government efforts in combating helping the free of land.
This surplus - which is added to the current timing right, including the higher levels instaured two years ago on secondary residences and purchase-locations - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects that the project will collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling per year.
Aproximately 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-residents of UK, which brings up prices and prevents first-accessers from becoming a place on the housing market.
Many rich regions of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "demonstrated cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who residen most of the time outside the country.
This new policy takes place just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the right of timing to help more young people acquire a first house.
Independent of the major construction companies of the construction company of maintaining the prices of the real estate at a high level by obtaining land land without using them, he invited Ms May to renounce the quotas of the rentable housing for rentable housing in order to regulate the "distraction of the real estate" which is followed in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reforms in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the elimination of "innocent" expulsion.
It also wishes to give advisory powers for the construction of new houses.
May said: "Last year, I said that I will devote my position as prime minister to the renaissance of British dream - that every new generation will have a better life.
In order to do this, we need to repair our market of broken houses.
UK will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it's unjust that it's as easy for individuals who are not residents in the UK, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house only for residents britanians who work hard.
"For a lot of people, the dream of access to property has become far away, and the misery of unbeabri remains too real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland’s technician Jack Ross explains that his “final ambition” is to become Scotland’s selector at a given time.
The 42-year-old Scotch is pleased with the challenge of making the Northeast Club rebuilt, which currently occupies the third place of Liga 1, with three points of leadership.
He joined Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren in Premier League Scotland last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I was elected for division B and that's all," Ross said at Sportsound of BBC Scotland.
"Aunque, i'm grown up after Scotland's matches in Hampden with my father and it's something that I never forget.
"No, this opportunity would be, however, only if I succeeded in the management of the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's selectors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's ex-technician says that he has no hesitation to stand behind so imblematic names in such a big club, having already rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“I think the success of this moment will be measured in light of the question “Can I bring this club back to Premier League?”
De la structure y de la infrastructure de la club, this is certainly part of Premier League," he added.
"It's not easy to get this, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I could bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years of career as a coach, after a period as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa to raise a relegation into third division and transformed St Mirren, who was at the edge of the relegation, into a great victory of the championship the next season.
Ross says himself more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa's support was "due to have been a real carport", he remembered.
“I think it’s better than to be coach than to play.
I think this is awesome, because I have gone out well, and I have gained my life, and I have enjoyed some of the precious tops.
Pero sometimes play is difficult.
There are plenty of details to arrange every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being coach I am very good.
I always wanted to lead, and now I am doing it; I feel comfortable in my skin more than I haven't been in my life adulteer. "

The summer canicule made the income of British pubs in difficulty, but made the pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The numbers indicate that bars and pubs groups recorded a stigma of their sales by 2,7 % in July, but income in restaurants declined by 4,8 .
Peter Martin, of CGA's cabinet-advisor, who compiled data, said: "The permanent sunset and the longest part of England's planned participation to the World Cup made the month of July follow the model of June, where bars experienced a 2,8% increase, except for restaurants, who have suffered even a major shock.
The decline of 1,8 % in the restauration sector in June only aggravated in July.
Pubs and bars where you serve alcoholic beverages are far the best in vogue, with more similar points than restaurants that lower them.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not just as restaurators.
It seems that people just want to go out to take a glass.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6,6 % per month, while food declined by 3 %."
Paul Newman, specialist RSM Rekreative and Hotelery Analyst, said: "These results follow trend observed since late April.
Weather and impact of major social or sport events remain the most important factors in terms of sales on the home market.
Nothing surprised that restauration groups continue to experience difficulties, although sales falling up average 4,8 % annually is particularly painful, in addition to constant cost pressure.
The long and hot weather wouldn't have been less convenient for food industry operators and the weather wouldn't tell us if the temperatures that we know more moderate in August would give a well merited repetition."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in the installation.
The sales of the industry are monitored by Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub industry, bars and restaurants UK, which collects and analyses performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 trillion pounds Sterling and constitutes standard in the established industry.

Online, adverts on milk shooter comparing mothers and cattle share opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a latte shooter compares mothers who breastfeeding to bulls during trading.
In order to mark the launch of what is called "first milk tire in the world silent," Elvie, a big public technology company, has launched a bold advertising inspired by a music video to show freedom that his new milk tire offers breastfeeding women.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91>
A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the ad, which was posted on the Facebook page of the company, has raised a controversy online.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from public, many of which say that it makes light on the "horrows" of the dairy industry.
"Emportable decision to use vacas to promote this product.
Like we, they must conceive and give birth to milk, except that their babies are taken away in the days after their birth.
The Elvie-leit shooter adaptes discreetly in a breast-free support (Elvie/Mama)
"This is a trauma that can be understandable for the mother and baby.
"But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise a milk shooter for mothers who keep their baby?"
Yesterday, someone else adds, "A publicity is so disconnected."
Others defended the ad, for example, a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarrante".
“I think that’s a idea of geniality.
I would have purchased one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper gave me the sensation of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
"It's a fun publicity for mothers who take their milk (frequencyly on their workplace or toilets) and feel like "boys."
"It's not a publicity that makes the praise of the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discrete shooting strips dissimulated in their support-gorge.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the tire-milk say they feel like they're cows.
However, the Elvie milk shooter is completely silent, without files or tubes and enters discreetly into a breastfeeding support, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even out while taking their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother, commented: “Elvie milk extract is a product so revolucionary that it deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between maternal mothers and milk vacas, we wanted to focus on extraction of maternal milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sensation of freedom that this new milk extract will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie shooter made one of the newspapers.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she used this product.
Hundreds of migrant children stayed silent in a camp in Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has greatly increased, although the number of monthly passages to borders remained relatively stable. This is partly due to the fact that speeches and severe policies of Trump administration made it possible to complicate children's placement among respondents.
Traditionally, the majority of respondents themselves were immigrants without papers and they were afraid to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by conducting themselves to rescue a child.
Risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, High Officer of the Imigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had made a request for adhesion to minors not accompanied by minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 % of the arrested people had no history of justice.
"Maximum 80 % of the respondents or members of their family are illegally here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” said Mr. Albence.

According to interlocutors and reports of the Refugee Network in the past few months, the longest child stays in custody, the less likely they become anxiety or depressive, which may resulte in injuries of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large establishment like Tornillo, these concerns are aggravated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in trouble are more likely to be neglected due to his size, according to the defenders of the rights of the child.
They added that moving children to camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could emphasize a trauma that many have difficulty manage.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to retire on-the-champ.
In a statement before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in this country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vicepremierminister, said that foreign forces were illegally located on the Syrian ground, under the pretext of combating terrorismo, and that “[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[

The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, the majority of whom form and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this country devastated by the war, France has over 1,000 soldats.
Moualem said about refugees, the conditions were favorable to their return, and accused "almost some Western countries" of "propagating irracional anxiety" that dissuaded refugees from returning.
“We invited international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
“They are politicing what should be a matter purely humanitarian.”
"United States and EU have notified that there will be no support for Syria's reconstruction until Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
The diplomats of the United Nations affirm that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a tampon zone in the last rebellious fortress of Idlib permitted progress of the political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack on the province where 3 million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, sublime that the agreement prevede "precise periods" and exposed hopes that militare measures will target jihadists, particularly combatants of Front Nusra, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, UN representative of the United Nations, hopes to soon convoke the first meetings of a new committee that will gather members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution and prepare the path for elections in Syria.
"Moualem defines the conditions of the Syrian Government of Syria's participation in the committee, affirming that the work of the group should be limited to "revision of Articles of the current Constitution", and formulate a warning against any interference.

Money from the outer country invaded the best elections in the mid-mandat
It's not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is inundated money, thanks to a reajustment of Congressional Circuits, which allowed two titulars to dispute the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh County, which was recently restructured, is the headquarters of the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who decreased his headquarters in another district during special elections last spring.

The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania statued, in January, that antikke arrondissements were non-constitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district gave a turnover to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of partial financing, the Congres Committee for Democratic Campaignation (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaignation Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won in justice in March last last year during a very popular special election very popular in the 18th district of Congress of Pennsylvania .
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
The politicians have given Democrats a little advantage.
US planned to penalize Salvador for his support for China, then resumed
The diplomats noted that Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, although Washington se opposed a little.
Trump had a friendship meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners exit the leadership of Trump Organization.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to call the leaders of US diplomatic missions in Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "these recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Department, at the beginning of the month in a statement.
But sanctions were planned only against Salvador, who received US aid estimate for $140 million in 2017, in particular in order to control narcotics and provide support for development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, including reductions of financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visa, would have been painful for Central America and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on theme of security and economic prosperity, in order to follow a similar meeting last year, seen as progress in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
However, in mid-September, seniors of the administration expressly stated that they wanted the conference to continue, ending all consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now express in the conference, planned for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance of the administration giving to the meeting, informed diplomats.
And the three US emissors are peacefully returned to Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe penalties by Washington.
A spokesman of Mr Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitists, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates under the cover of anonymity.
Their words have been corroborated by an independent analyst near the administration, who is also anonymous.
Study History
The next tuile could be the report of special lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle of Mr. Trump's justice. The public dossier is now supported by substantive evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also oriente his investigation towards the question of a connivency of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack against our elections.
If Congressional control of Congress change hand hand, Mr. Trump will be obligated to make accounts before that organ, in the moment that he is ready to present himself before voters and, perhaps, before a jury consisting of his pairs.

A knee lesion canceled the midfield Graham Dorrans from his first part of the season until nul match 2:2 against Villarreal, but it's convinced that Rangers are able to get the best from such a result to achieve operations.
“It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” commented 31-year-old attacker.
“We went into the game thinking to get something and we left it with a point.
We might have been able to win it at the end, but, in general, no match probably constituted a fair result.
They probably were better in the first half-time and we returned in the second half-time and we were the best team.
Jueves, tonight, is another big European festival.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result during their last match, however, I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my wounds and the changes made in club as such, but there's a factor satisfaction about this place now.
Team is good and the guys enjoy a lot; training is high quality.
"Happy we can go before now, let's see the last season behind us and win."

Although the participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted to deal with them, few people discussed the question with their family members.
Nearly half of those who participated in National Studies said they talked with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," explains Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Branch.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husbands and children: "You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't know what you want before.
Collaborate with your adviser and family to determine where and how you can receive care, because these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your Financial Advisor: Your Financial Advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your decisions in terms of long-term care financing can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with sales value to help you cover these costs or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to assure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles when passing.

Considere also a question about your financial resources.

Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parents have a medical emergency and they go to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Leave these details in a written document to be prepared well.

Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutors of New York demand death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged attacker of New York who made eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in this state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, would have used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bicycle path on West Side Highway Road in Lower Manhattan, while walking on his walkway and a bicycler in October last year.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to give evidence that Saipov "intensively" murdered eight victims and "intensively" inflicted "intensively" serious body damage, according to the declaration of intention to request the death penalty imposed at Southern District of New York.
These two accusations may result in the death penalty, according to the jurisprudence.
A few weeks after this assault, a major federal jury convicted Saipov of 22 heads of charges, including 8 accusations of killing for extortion of funds, commonly used by federal prosecutors in crimes organized and one for crimes of violence and destruction of automobiles.
"Attack needed a "preparation and premeditation"", declare prosecutores, denominando Saipov metodo de "hateful, cruel and devastated".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused lesion, lesion, loss and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", declare intensiv.
Five of the victims were tourists argentinas.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed death penalty in the context of prosecution for 10 years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murder by two narcotraficers, but subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple married executed for delivering to acts of conspiration and spioning for the USSR during the two years after the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, demonstrated that there was no resentment in the days and months following the tragedy, according to jurisprudence.
Police said that he was contented with his acts.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been urged to perform the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the accusation act.
Independently, he demanded to show Daesh flag in his hospital chamber, the police said.
He was invisible to 22 accused officers.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, declare being "naturally disappointed" of the decision to intentify prosecutions.
"We think that the decision of solving death penalty rather than accepting the offensive and condemning him to prison life without possibility of liberation can only prolonge the traumatism associated with these events for all interested parties," Patton said.
The defending team of Saipov had already asked prosecutors not to claim death penalty.

Aerolíneaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The airline has not responded immediately to requests for more precise information about the passenger, such as the age or nationality of the airline.
Local ships participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Autorities reported Friday that 7 people were hospitalized.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers were always in hospital, and that they were all in stabil state.
Cause of crash and exact occurrences remain uncertain.
The airline and US Navy said that the aircraft had landed in a lagune near the landing track.
Some witnesses estimated that the aircraft had crossed the track.
The American Passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was so low.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Jaynes said that he and the others could flipper in the water until the emergence of the aircraft flipper.
He said that the agents of the boat had panic and cried, and that he would suffer from a minor lesion to his head.
The American Navy said that marines working close to improve a quay had also participated in rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people to farmland before the plane flows in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates that 111 people were killed in accidents of airlines recorded in Papouasie-New Guinea in the last two decades, but no one was Air Niugini.
The Analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The accusation updated his case Saturday in a man's prosecution accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, US Department of Justice analyst, testified for hours as expert in the field of information analysis.
He described the jury how he used records of phone calls passing from a mobile to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night when the latter died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he pretended to meet his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came to bar Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
when prokurors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he had said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford responded, "[He] mente, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers for about two weeks after she died.
The telephones show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis delete SMS, calls and Chambers' coordinates from his phone.
"Hil" , "have eliminated him from his life."
Defence must start its complaint Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to stand before the jury during the day.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is initiated while FBI starts his investigation.
"I thought that if we could obtain something like what he asked - a limited time investigation, limited in scope - we could bring a little unity," - said Flake Saturday, adding him feared that the committee would "break out" in a partisan impasse.
Why Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters didn't want FBI to investigate?
Their resilience is due to the choice of the moment.
If the Republicans, as planned, achieve poor score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to select the man they want to be at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush accepted the phone to call senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and encountered through his wife Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What's going on after FBI's report?
There will be vote in Senate, in which currently residen 51 Republicans and 49 demokrats.
We still not know if Kavanaugh will be able to receive 50 votes in Senat, which would allow Mike Pence, vicepresident, to resignate votes, to confirmate before Supreme Court.
North Korea: number of desertors "call" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean desertors to South Korea has declined since the rise in power Kim Jong-un seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Unity Ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, versus 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and increase in tariffs demanded by passagers constitute key factors.
Pyongyang has not formulated public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters will finally give South Korean nationality.
"Se Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le Le
The majority flipped by China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), situated between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often repatriates them with force.
"Relations between North and South - which are technically still in war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Initial this month, ambassadors of both countries joined Pyongyang in the context of interlocutions focused on negotiations on denuclearization, which remained up to that time.
This took place after the historic meeting of June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in large lines, to work for a Korean Peninsula denuclearized.
Sabta, however, North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, invoked sanctions in the USA since that time, no progress.
"Unless there's confidence in the United States, there's no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it's excluded that we're the first to operate a single-side disarmament," Ri said in a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi nominate Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric", and claims it is impossible to sit in Supreme Court
Pelosi, Leader of Parliamentary Minority, calificated candidate to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of "hysteric" and said that he was impossible to sit in Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi formulated these comments as part of an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I'm not able to stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this way, they would have treated it as 'hysteric'," Pelosi said about his response to Kavanaugh's testimonial before Senato Committee of the Magistrature Thursday last Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the claims that he would have sexually agressed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teens.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh proved very emotive and sometimes failed to shout and thrive while speaking his family and years of high school.
In addition, he expressly condemned the Democrats sitting in the committee, calling him the allegations concerning "grotesky assassination and coordinated" organized by liberals deceived that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said, according to her, Kavanaugh's testimonial proved that he was unable to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he discredited himself with these statements and how he took it to Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi ahesied when asked him if she would try to destitute Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the democrats would obtain majority from the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, he is not only able to sit in Supreme Court, he is also able to sit in court where he's currently."
Currently, Kavanaugh is judge of DC Circuit Call Court.
Pelosi added, además, that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh, in his auditions of confirmation of the charges, examinated the question of the possibility of reversing certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a histerical and partial person to go to court and to wait until we say 'it'', "Pelosis said.
And women must serve them.
This is a lawful decree, months and years of anger, and it cannot go out without weeping.
"We weep when we weep," said Mrs Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
"I'm greatly helped by a woman who was frame somewhere, who told me that she also weep when she's angry, but she developed a technique that allows her to tell the person to whom she's talking, when she's angry and crying: "You can think that I'm sad because I'm crying.
“I’m angry.”
AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Larms are permitted as exodus to anger, partly because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of the most important memories of a first job, in a men-dominated office, where I found myself a day while I was crying inexprimable anger, was that I had been arrested by the skin of my neck by an old woman - a cold director who always had me a little intimidated - who trained me in a escalier.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Deputy of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart was taken in an extraconjugal case on board a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the countryside, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to Presidency.
“It wasn’t a deliberation that was moderately thoughtful,” she confided in me laughing, 30 years later.

As the campaign was very advanced, she took delay in collecting money, so she swerved that she wouldn't participate in less than collecting $2 million.
Battle was lost in advance.
She found out that some of her supporters who normally gave $1,000 to men were supposed to give him only $250.
"Doesn't you believe that I have a right to give you a chance?"
"When she announced in her speech that she wouldn't launch a campaign official, she was boregoned by her emotions - gratitude for those who supported her, frustration face to the system, which made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that she feels that it's arrogant.
"You would think I was a nervous depression," remembered Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember what they were going to put on my tomb.

How the trade war between USA and China could benefit Beijing
"The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China have been devastating, and although the battle is not far from the end, a divergence between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing China's key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important rise occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 trillion ($150 trillion), thus paying half of all goods from China that come to the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded naturally, striking recently tariffs from 5-10% to 60 billion dollars of US goods.
China has promised to equalize the United States, and it's unlikely that the second largest global economy will soon fall.
To make Washington back, it is to obey the requirements, but to obey publicly before the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, President of China.
Experts mened, however, that if Beijing could play his role correctly, pressures of US Trade War could have a positive effect on China in the long term, reducing interdependence between both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions favorables to economic slowdown in one or another countries is in fact much more dangerous than what observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, at the Center for New American Security reflection group.
Syria is "preparated" to return from refugees, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria declares ready for voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuilt this country devastated by a war that has duration over seven years.
In addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, situacion on-site is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorisme", - he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now satisfied for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country they were forced to leave because of terrorisme and one-sided economic measures that were intended for their daily life and for their means of subsistence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have abandoned the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
6 million more people still live in this country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that Syrian regime would welcome favorablely aid in reconstruction of this devastated country.
He insisted, however, he wouldn't accept conditional assistance ni assistance from the countries that would speak about the rebellion.
