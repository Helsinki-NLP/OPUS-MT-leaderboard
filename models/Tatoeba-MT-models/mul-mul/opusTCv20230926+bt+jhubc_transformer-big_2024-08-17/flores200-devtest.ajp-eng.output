For Savannah, the prescriptions of which a human digestive system is difficult to match its requirements for amino acids from existing plant resources.
And, as well, Falky Eish God failed to do bad consequences: like growth appetite, malnutrition and death at the end.
The most easy-to-access of plant resources is the proteins that can be obtained from leaves and potatoes, but it is difficult for the main ones that we have assumed is to join only if applicable.
Instead, animal foods (small, white, and eggs) are not easy to digest, just as they provide high amounts of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
All things we have taken into account, it is not necessary to be surprised if our ancestors have solved the “first protein problem” just the same way that the champagne operates in Savannah today.
