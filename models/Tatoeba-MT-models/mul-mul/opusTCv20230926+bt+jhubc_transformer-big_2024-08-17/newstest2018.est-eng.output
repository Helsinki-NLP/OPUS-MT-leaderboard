Four members of the Kemerovo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the post office, the police in Spain arrested the so-called leader of the Kemerovo grouping under Estonia, Slava Gulevitši, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevitch held in Spain was arrested with court approval.
The court also arrested three suspects held in Estonia yesterday.
According to the suspect, it is called Kemerovo Criminal Community members aged 27-57 years of age who are primarily committed to drug abuse.
In the province of Malaga in Spain, Mijases, the alleged criminal community was detained.
In Estonia, three men were suspected, one of whom, according to data collected, was the headquarters of the Criminal Community and two were members of the Criminal Community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles in the criminal community were clearly divided.
The aim of the criminal community was to commit drugs and thus to earn criminal proceedings,” said the head of the criminal proceedings, State Attorney Vahur Verte.
"We do not exclude the increase in the suspicious circle in the criminal case," the prosecutor added.
People who have previously been incurred in the court of interest of the law enforcement agencies have been involved, and some have been punished for drug crimes.
The blood stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues was significant during the entire investigation.
"International cooperation has become normal for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said Prosecutor Verte.
Chief of the Department of Central Criminal Police Ago Leis said a preliminary investigation of prisoners took about a year and a half.
"In the first half of the long-term realisation of work, and at the same time we kept suspicious of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
He added that the Central Criminal Police officers were helping to detain Spain.
For years, we have a good relationship and a relationship with the Spanish police and civilian cards.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can get them out of the other side of Europe,” Leis said.
The information collected so far also shows that men who have been suspected in freedom can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor has requested their arrest and the court has also approved it.
The man arrested in Spain is waiting for his resignation to Estonia.
In such a criminal case, property, vehicles and cash are detained to ensure the confiscation.
The criminal proceedings are conducted by the Office of Organized Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and are conducted by the State Prosecutor.
In 2005, Slava Gulevitchi accused him of being expelled and sentenced to five years of prison.
In the middle of the previous decade Gulevitch was considered the second major man in the Estonian criminal world after the toneal submarine Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch, originating in Kemerovo, rose to Estonia in the early 1990s, when he began to deal with expressions in Tallinn.
He allegedly charged taxi drivers and prostitutes working at different hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax for businesses.
International joint operations, criminal income confiscation and enacted judgments confirm that the fight against organized crime is effective.
For example, the last sentences, which were allocated from the so-called Dikajev Criminal Community, of eight convicted criminal proceeds of EUR 80 000, or a sentence against nine persons in the fact that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal community in 2006, which was aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the crime of human trafficking in the East.
For the amount of criminal income confiscated, there is about €71,500.
In these criminal matters, the success has been ensured by policemen to exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, where necessary, to take action together in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns from traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned people traveling to Missouri from the country’s discrimination policy and racial attacks.
The statement of the group states: "The NAACP travel note issued on the Missouri state, which is valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African American passengers, visitors and missourians to be particularly careful when moving around the state."
According to the NAACP, the group did not encourage travel warning to issue such a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to overcome discrimination cases, as well as the fact that it is inequality in the state's targets of the courts in particular.
"People's rights are violated.
They are drawn to a teaspoon because of their skin color, they are blown or killed,” said President Rod Chapel in Missouri, The Kansas City Star.
“We have never received so much complaints before.”
This is the first warning issued by the organization about the state of the United States.
The collection referred to events such as racial shootings towards black-student students at Missouri University and the death of 28-year-old black-student Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspected circumstances after he was driven through the state by the gasoline and the Missouri police arrested him without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the Missouri chief prosecutor’s note refers to a recent report that shows that the cars of black car drivers are suspended in the state with a 75% higher probability than those of white cars.
"The mark is designed to make people conscious and to warn their family, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be ready, whether that means taking off the money or informing their relatives that they are going through the country."
Based on the latest data from the FBI reporting program, in 2015, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri, which put the number of similar infringements in the state to 16th place.
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to complain to the court of the company for discrimination on housing or job search.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after the adoption of immigration laws that forced local people to arrest for immigration violations, as the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Usually, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued travel alerts about other countries, but recently, interest groups have begun to use this measure as a reaction to certain U.S. internal laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis may be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses call for an acute inflammation of the liver.
However, at the low cost is chronic hepatitis B and C, which may develop further as liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver corrhosis and liver cancer.
Health agency’s epidemiology adviser Kulu Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, sickness, vomiting, vomiting, stomach pain, glaring outbreaks, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowness of skin and mucous joints.
The last disease is also derived from the popular name of liver inflammation.
Hepatitis can occur in children without symptoms of disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can be determined only on the basis of data from the laboratory study.
Acne hepatitis can pass over to chronic hepatitis and pass for decades without symptoms of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver damage.
The ear Kutsar extracts different forms of hepatitis and describes their passage closer.
Hepatitis A viruses spread sickly from a person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, by infected people’s outpouring to hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth-to-mouth and drug consumption.
A risk group belongs to the family members and caregivers of the disease, people with chronic liver diseases, people with infectious sex, men with sex, drugs, travellers visiting countries with high spread of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, especially vaccination is recommended for many passengers and people in the risk group of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to fulfil daily hygiene requirements: washing or disinfecting hands before consuming food wash all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses spread when exposure to the sick person's blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, Augustus, using blood-infected olive fruits (treatments, weightlifting means), with donor blood, with a person with hepatitis impairment, and with hepatitis disease from the mother to the mother's baby.
The risk group of hepatitis B is injected by drugs, infected sex partners, male sex partners, infected mothers, sick family members and nurses, blood and other body vessels, health care professionals, rescue workers and police officers who are sick with high diseases in hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group, as well as patients with chronic liver diseases, HIV infections, sexually spreading diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other ingredients and injections, tattoos and Augustus, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex or prevention of sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B in Estonia is part of the national immunization plan and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread when contacting the sick person's blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, taking blood, using infected fetus, donor blood, sex with a person with hepatitis impairment, and the disease of hepatitis from maternal to maternal to maternal/necessary birth.
The risk group of C-hepatitis infection include injectable drugs, infected sex partners, male sex men, infected mothers, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other body cells encountering healthcare, rescue workers and police officers, high-hepatitis patients with HIV and C.
The prevention of hepatitis C is: preventing the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other ingredients and injections, tattooing and Augustus, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the virus of hepatitis D, which multiplies in the presence of the virus of hepatitis B.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis viruses spread by exposure to blood and other body fluids, infected with injections, sexually, and rarely infected with maternal bones.
Hepatitis risk group D is chronic hepatitis B virus donors and people who do not have anti-immunity against hepatitis B.
The effective preventive measure is vaccination with a vaccine for hepatitis B, which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread through fetal-oral drinking water and food, including little hot-treated animal meat, fish and scarf when eating, donor blood, jointly used syringes and infected mothers.
Travellers can get infected with high hepatitis E in countries.
The prevention measures for hepatitis E are to meet the hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after walking in the toilet, before preparing and eating, after the care of the sick.
Trees and vegetables are washed before consuming, avoid eating little hot-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid consuming drugs.
Although the competitors in the last round tried to get out of the four-time Olympic winner, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final circle and won 26.49.51 over time.
Pharaoh did not think for a long time, dragging his husband, Tania and his children, after finishing with him.
It was a special moment for me.
I own my family very much.
Being at the border with them was wonderful,” Pharaoh told the journalists.
Farah targets the 5th titalist in London for 5,000 and 10,000 meters of gold dublies.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Lady in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's extraordinary story" is the birth of one of the works of art in the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more thoroughly history.
To get more influenced by an outstanding crowd of information, that is, in a harder curve, to put a more tight theme in the titled portrait permitted by an exceptional lotion.
The story of Adele Bloch-Bauer in Gustav Klimt and his painting “Lady in Gold” would now be a single story between two books: Adele Bloch-Bauer’s story and a larger and wider history book of respected Jewish families and the German occupation along with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book brings into the wine-pulsed culture, and whose own capital is Austria, may at least be difficult to imagine how life was walking around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago or how all of the heads turned around in Central's coffee when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultures was in one of the richest cities in Europe, with the name known in the book, you feel like a grammar culture.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was acting in a city in which there was an unhealthy syphilis and was the highest level of Europe's self-development, it seems that the creation does not give anything to development.
Or maybe - even every pair of our pairs of pints adds color to the cultural language of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna was explosively growing, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the end of the centuries, every tenth of the people of the wine were Jews.
Adele's parents were also new in Vienna, but for that time, when Adele married two times to open the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Blochi and Climtil as a poster for his famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele, all the glamour life she belonged to, did not pull.
When looking at "Lady in Gold", it’s hard to believe that the infection at the end of life this great lady of socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait from Klimt, he was the last moment the hottest artist in Vienna.
Klimti ordered 4000 Krones at that time, with a quarter of the price of a good location.
The fact that in some portraits the master's love story was suspected of modeling, the sugar magnate did not push.
As for Adele, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist in the course of the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady Gold."
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait exceptional story", Varrak 2016, English translated Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the start of the work, Klimt had gone to the Basilica of Ravenna in San Vitale, and researchers believe that the casting mosaics seen here as Emperor Theodoras gave the artist an idea of making the Golden Portrait of Adels as a mosaic painted.
Klimt introduced his "Dami Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and about the same time (in 1907-1908) was born on the golden painting "Kissing".
The likeness of the two women was not noticed by artists.
What is Hitler’s relationship?
"I think I owe him as a reminder of my friend Klimt to make his handwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum in February 1918 and wanted their family's collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had made a portrait of Adel.
In her testing (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt's landscaped Austria Gallery.
He inherited his circumstances to his sisters Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt graduated from "Austria Mona Lisa", he tried to enter the 17-year-old Adolf Hitler's Vienna Academy of Beautiful Arts, but fell on the drawing path.
Although sometimes Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is considered the reason that the Jewish professors did not accept him at the academy, none of his graduates were actually Jewish.
Nevertheless, the task of Austrian gallery referred to in the testing was significantly transformed by 1939 - it had become important to find pleasant works for the Nazi parties from the rich Jewish artworks of Vienna.
Hitler’s personal artwork was also suitable for some of Adele’s work at home, but not for Klimt’s own.
Sixty years after the Nazism of Arts began a decade-long dispute between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer inheritors.
Here it is only to be noted that if "Superview" is seen in the castle of Vienna in Belvedere, then Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Lady's Gold" must be watched to ride to New York New York Gallery.
And before the trip to Wine, read the above-mentioned book.
Even if you don’t plan to look at Klimt’s work, because at least my emotions turned around after closing the book for more than $135 million Nazi and Jews sold for Adele Bloch-Bauer’s painting and model.
So not as much portrait as a gender fate story - and a very moving story.
Nowadays, it was easy to focus on events with the genre Bauerite produced at the beginning of the book.
A 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada.
In the previous round, Gold was very close to the personal record of his own 200 meters of swing, swimming at 2.16,62.
The 17-year-old Tippmark originates from the end of the week when the Canadian Junior Championships were held for the period of 2.16,58, said Priit Avyku Swimming Blog.
Gold has reached the last 10th A-final.
In the final, he crossed the distance with 2.15,76 and reached a good seventh place with a new powerful top margin.
The Estonian record (2.15.13) of Alina Kendzior remained a little more than half a second.
Gold rose for the third time in the Estonian front table, and his fresh personal topmark is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young future is still starting at the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freelance and 200 m and 400 m complexion.
Last week, the Toronto Canadian Junior Championships were held, and Gold made a successful start there as well.
He won 200 meters of silver medal during the time of 2.03.22.
It was so quickly captured by Estonia in 2008.
Over time, more quickly than gold, Estonia has only swimled this distance from the recorded Estonian Elina Partõka.
The Estonian living in Canada won another 100-m-free proxy medal with an excellent personal record and the new Estonian season’s top margin of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, the older of his year, has swimled this distance faster than a century.
He reached the personal top margin at another 100 m in the backyard to receive a notice in the opening time of 1.03.69.
On the half-longest distance, he reached only seventh place when the rain was at the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently the leader of the Estonian season's lead tablet at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics tear their teeth
The time has come - that means relaxation for President Donald Trump.
As Trump has been one of the most popular holidays to date, critics are already tearing their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president’s 17-day holiday plans to spend a private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president’s holiday began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have spoken about the holiday for a week.
They're going to get Trump too often on vacation.
The president is usual to spend the weekend in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
Trump has not been the most purified president in his 196 official days.
For example, George W. Bush had been on this holiday for 67 days, but Barack Obama was half less than Trump, just 21 days.
But Trump will soon forget about it.
A few days after receiving the president, Trump said "60 minutes" that for a long vacation in his office, there will be no time left, because there is very much to do.
He also announced three years ago that Barack Obama had been on vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter: “When Obama is on vacation, he plays golf, walks on parties and jazz counters, the ISIS journalists crashes off the road.”
According to White House officials, the 17-day golf course is not a relaxation.
It is officially referred to as a work vacation, during which Trump has no time to read or other mental activities.
In addition to the vacation, there must be another reason.
This means that the conditioning system in the Western White House is replaced and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
The Oval Cabinet and other chairman’s work rooms are also located in the West.
"I don't think anyone else wants to be in the west in August if there are 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesman who emphasized that the president will continue to work during the holidays.
When President Trump spends 17 days, you’ll get a video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Don’t Candidate to State Office if you don’t tolerate voters’ criticism
Our country's father knew some of the disadvantages of the media.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn’t take long to get him out of everything from the internal policy to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn’t force his critics to quiet.
For in 1783, Washington said that “freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and that in darkness and silence, we can be led to the compelling slaughter of sheep.”
This brings me to Larry Hogan from Maryland, who is hard to see that there is more way in Washington.
The Hogan subjects have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts that have published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) complained to the court.
The governor’s officials called for an empty appeal, and online comments cubicized the contradictions in the style "What Interests?".
“That’s all Facebook,” many said.
But it reads.
And that's a lot when it's a man like Hogan.
The act is incredibly overweight in a democratic state with a popular Republican Cuban.
Its approval percentage is well on the other side of the country's 50 cuberners.
Hogan is not an unthinkably reacting wind.
He has managed the state firmly and has remained strictly determined by its principles.
In addition, he has used the main tool in communicating with his voters quite fragilely on Facebook, showing, for example, after chemotherapy for the first time, his glow head.
Therefore, the website of the Gubernator is a public forum with official label, managed by taxpayers' dollar-paid staff blocking people visiting is unnecessary and in the end dangerous.
The Hogan Press Representative Amelia Chasse defended the interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing else than moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of online rollers, remote mailers or anger full of people.
The Post talked to several real people who blocked Hogan.
And that's exactly what they're really people who communicate with their chosen managers. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not online roles.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and even not robbers.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his posts, emphasising the Catholicism of Hogani.
Lawyers from Maryland Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Raman, did not excite anger, but really hate crimes.
"I'm wisely commenting that I'm disappointed because he hasn't reacted to hate crimes or to other recent news," he wrote in The Post's commentary.
“But I don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, some call it immediately as a collective effort, rather than admitting that it is concerned with a large number of citizens.”
What the Gubernator’s officials called “a targeted bulb posting,” others would probably call “public support”.
The Facebook history allows you to easily adjust messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It’s much cleaner than old, when workers were sent to do the same to gather newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn them or arrest protesters and force them to silence.
That’s what’s happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for hacking Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has defeated Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the first judgments of marking on this issue was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the chief of the Loudou County Supervisory Board broke the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, after using ACLU Facebook and Twitter, Governor Matt Bevini (R) also visited.
It shouldn't be so hard.
During Washington, there was a similar effect on affordable postal costs as on the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers were four-folded, and the way he was conducted.
And even then, Washington had to put on the chest with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington’s decisions in the country.
According to the historical documents of George Washington's web-based letter collection project, the cabinet was subjected to petitions that criticized his views on friendship, trade and maritime agreements concluded with the United Kingdom.
But he didn’t force them to quiet.
Freedom of speech, special discussions and discussions are the basics of our country.
Right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in Renaissance Club for the comfort of the home territory
The former European representative Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory within the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open golf courses take place in East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Translator, who was led by the last round of the Archerfield Links roads last year before Paul Eales was underway, has set up a new place for the event and plays the role of the club founder and executive Jerry Sarvad instead of a tournament recipient.
"I see how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club is blowing in full light with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players see the path in their best form, it's in a coal.
Jerry has done a great job in building this place.
He is an exciting supporter of golf and feels proud of the achieved here.
This allows the road to be perfectly present.”
The English Eales is looking forward to protecting the championship for the first time, although the man has won during his 32-year-old career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's a very special feeling," said a baking player in Southports.
“I couldn’t defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken away from my victory calendar for a year.
It's magical to come back to this.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for my wife and Sharon, the victory of last year was special.
It was a very special time we stayed in our hearts.”
Again, Gary Orr, who joined the European Seniors at the beginning of this year, returns to the competition at the age of 50.
It was his first event in Scotland after attending Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Home plays is always a bit more meaningful," said the Helensburger Orr.
“You want to be good, but you’re also feeling extra tension.
I have enjoyed playing again and have shown a pretty good golf game.
I am pleased with the passage of things.”
The trio joins the former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the tournament tournament champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain of Ryder, Sam Torrance, are two of the six competitors, the rest of whom are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free and parking costs 5 pounds for one passenger car and 10 pounds for one or more passenger car.
All income goes to the Prostate Cancer UK charity organization.
Poverty and death of Indonesia's gold hot land
When Bardina Dege's dinner is prepared, he doesn't use a bowl.
He even rarely uses a pot.
In the wooden house in the capital of the province of Panai, in the province of Papouasi, in the Indonesian province of Papouasi, in Enarotali, it lays a battadine on the fire station in the local language of the household.
After half an hour, the skin is taken from the other part of the fire and washed with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor with no furniture, and there he also makes his everyday homework, for example, washing the neighbouring gender with dirt water.
The role of the business plays every man's roof in the room.
Since he is the youngest of four women of his husband, he has not been appointed to take care of any farmer.
Poligamy is a common mail here.
Late working, however, may be dangerous for most of the village men are unemployed, and many of them drink hard, in addition, there are still soldiers here.
“Don’t let anyone dare to walk around in the village after five o’clock in the evening,” he says.
This is a rare fear of living in the Papouasian mountains, and it is a fact that with the former Dutch colony, which joined Indonesia under the rule of law in 1969, a referendum was made after the polemics, which forced only 1026 elders to vote under the eyes of the forces of the Occupation.
The movement that promptly pushed the Dutch to get rid of the government of Jakarta, keeping the region under strong control, keeping outside journalists and human rights supervisors away.
In 2003, the province was officially allocated to Papouasie and West Papouasie, so the independent Papouasie New Guinea remained an eastern part of the island.
Enarotal is the same way as a lost place. To get here, you need to fly 90 minutes from the province’s capital Jayapura to Nabir and then pass the five-month journey by car.
There is no public transportation.
A city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden terraces surrounded by bamboo terraces and covered by waves of iron roofs, which have transformed stainless steel into different tones of yellow browns.
Very few Indonesians have taken the trip here, not talking about journalists, and have almost never gone to a foreign country at all.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago worshiped godly popes named Uga Tamee.
Other changes have also occurred.
"We haven't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his hand-made turban, dark plum and dark seal.
"Before we weared only plants on our body."
Papoea is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of the population live below the poverty line, and the statistics of infant death and insufficiency is one of the worst in Asia.
It is also an Indonesian golden age.
From all 100 km from Panya, a mountain province of about 153,000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the world's largest and most profitable golden shipment Grasberg, which belongs to the company Freeport McMoran operating in Phoenix.
In 2015, Freeport dropped around US$3.1 billion in gold and washing.
In addition, Paapua can be proud of the stock of consumers, estimated at $78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the sufferings of the papyrus, because they require the presence of a powerful Indonesian army to escape.
The New York Times 2005 study showed that Freeport paid around $20 million to local military and military units from 1998 to 2004, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The efforts of the pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden and go uncomfortable with them.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 refugees have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have raped, tortured and imprisoned the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killing of genocide occurred in the mountainous areas of the villages of Paapua in the 1970s.
Only last year, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police region.
The Birsbane's Headquarters Report, "We Lose All" of 2016, contains witnesses for cruelty committed last year, such as criminal killings, torture (a second report says that rape and electricity strikes are particularly widespread) and violent destruction of peaceful detentions.
"The number of victims is difficult to read as such incidents occur every week," said Human Rights Watch Indonesian researcher Andreas Harsono.
The curves are even strongerly shut down, because the natural resources of the Papouasian have caused the flow of new visitors from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million population of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing because of the Indonesian national chains of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi islands, Muslims come from economic migrants.
Family meals are sold in garlic and mixed vegetables gado-gadot, serving with soil level.
The locals are unable to fight with them.
"Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables cheaper on the traditional local market than potatoes," said 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to Jayapura, the province's capital.
"Papa's mothers [women] are losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to deal with their inequalities and human rights violations in Papouasi.
He won the 27th election round in Jakarta to the Presidential Palace of Paapua 29, including Paniai.
However, there are very few changes in the country and locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he will fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice," You said.
In fact, Paniai was weak only two months after his appointment to Jokowi from October.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children in Enarotal sang a Christmas song at the edge of the desert when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on the motorcycle.
The children injured told them they should turn the show in.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai’s speech, one of the soldiers was assaulted on their vote and later went back with four soldiers.
According to the victims and the witnesses, the soldiers drank the children behind them and washed them with their arms.
Then one of the soldiers shot a seat of children.
A 16-year-old child, Julian Yeimot, was so cruel that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election committee burned the building and the next day, the escaleraus things were further.
About 1000 young men, women and children in Papoua gathered to ask for justice in front of the local police department and the military management center.
They took ceremonial hunting buses and introduced Paapua to the Pago Maya occupation of the Waita Dance, during which he ran around and matchied the bird's song.
Some protesters began to run rocks by the police and the military.
In the past, a command was sent to the soldiers via a national radio. "If the population has more than three times resistance, let them go," according to the official document, which has been seen in the TIME magazine, but which has not been issued to local media.
In Enarotal, the elderly city of Kego Koto, Jeremias Kayame (56) felt a threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot on the left side," she told TIME in his left colors on the wooden house's veranda.
Kayma still doesn't know who was a shooter, but he says that a month has come from the lines of soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of money," he added.
The local man, Alphius Youw, saw his nephew shooting at him three times.
"I ran to him and explored his body to make sure that it is with him," told TIME John, who uses only one name for many Indonesians.
"I thought he was dead... I kissed him."
Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that he was subject to the security of his department only because it was attacked.
"We must protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill," Police Officer Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
News about the murders arrived in Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed fellowship with the victims’ families and promised to deal with misconducts in Papouasi.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never be repeated in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security, Wiranto, said he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve crimes against human rights.
But the apologies were almost immediately followed.
“Most crimes happened long ago.
Some of them occurred in the early 1990s and 2000s.
The fact is that we have been committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow a certain process,” he said.
By speaking to the magazine TIME on 5 June in Jakarta, Wiranto resumed his words, saying he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Poland.
Instead, he said, "Everything is resolved by law."
Wiranto, accused of crimes against human rights in more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papouasi, including the death of Paniais.
The families of the victims of pania accepted such allegations with deep concern.
"I have been listened over four times in the last three years, but no progress has taken place," John said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I am afraid that the military will arrest me, I am afraid that I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid of this intercourse.
He said he had been handed over by the military after he had helped four victims to get rid of.
“After the death of the dead bodies, the military came to seek me,” he said.
The fires haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired tourists in the neighbouring district of Paniai in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when he went to a conversation between the visitors and the chief of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
The 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who crashed fish by hunting into the nearby rivers, died on the way to the hospital.
Hateful guests protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the guests were shouting with the police with stones, with the latter responding to warnings.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian armed police) began to shoot the people, killing one person.
"We've been in great panic, we're afraid of paying," said Dominggu Badi, 29-year-old, who lives in the hospital nearby and saw the injured enters.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has requested the responsibility of police officers in the matter and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the region.
The panic has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of reasoned development in the midst of the Papouasian region is the dissatisfaction of many, dani and dami occupations living in the middle of the country.
Many of them have joined the Free Papouasian Movement (VPL) Army, which, according to it, protects the rights of refugees, organizing accidental attacks and human attacks among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL predators come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military's "defense of state sovereignty" has been arrested by Paniais over the past few years and has arrested thousands of people.
Some of them will never appear again.
Among the people of Papa is known as "tragic forgotten."
Poverty feeds discouragement.
Less rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
The body is the same inaccessible.
People grow all their foods themselves mainly potatoes, in addition to a little fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman’s job, each of which can take care of four or five battadine soils.
They usually hold most of their families, the rest sells on the local market.
Ten bats cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupee (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between firefighters and new migrants has been deepened from the opening of new airlines at Nabire Airport.
These few jobs that exist will go better to trained and stronger migrants.
The pope itself often lacks capital or skills necessary to operate a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying because there are no jobs or money here," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Council of Agriculture.
The separation keeps the eyes of the world away from the party.
In addition, the external media remains tough.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papo, although they were granted a rare film permit.
According to Vice President of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, Jokowi’s election rights have not been implemented to lose the restrictions imposed on reporters to promote transparency and development.
"The easternest peaceful provinces in Indonesia in Papa and the reportage from the West Papa are threatening new threats to reject the visa and bring a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of a clear view of the journal means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the neighbors of the Papouasian.
In March, six countries in the Pacific were encouraged to investigate "a variety of widespread crimes" in the Papouasian country, including the shooting of Panai, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands.
The same countries have historically supported VPL.
Representative of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, dismissed the accusations of grouping, saying to journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia remains a democratic procedure and freedom of the press so that evidence of human rights violations can be difficult to lose."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands introduced a visit to Jayapura on May 4th to the State of Human Rights Deputy Kees Van Barre, local people stopped staying at the meeting but were anonymous, according to their silence, asking: “We want freedom.”
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the Pope does not believe that they will vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but people around him who are involved in the shooting of pania," said Hobai, President of the Employment Council.
He wants to understand that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania live under the threat of the Shish Army, they are deceiving because of the Nigel education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, as well as other papayas, must be debtors of their voice given to Jokowi to pay him.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and fears, the families of the shooting victims of Paniai were able to get rid of the last symbolic opposition they hit the country against the police officers and the military base of one of the victims.
Knowing that justice will never be punished, at least they will not let those who are responsible forget their crimes.
“One of our family members was killed,” says Yacobus with his head fallen.
"What else can we do?"
Dubai Torch's airplane was fired for the second time under its own
The fire broke through one of the world’s highest living towers in Dubai, forced hundreds of people to escape from its 337-metre height and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has released a high building in just two years, called the Torchiks cases, the Torvik Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct cause of fire was presented.
“We slept and awakened after the fire alarm and the cries of people.
We run down the stairs and we took about 10 minutes to go down the 50th floor,” one resident who called himself George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Protection Officers, firefighters removed approximately 4 a.m. by local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for the victim to ensure the main security.
This intermediate event can again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outside surface of high buildings around the world.
During a 2015 firefighting investigation by Torch’s Board of Directors, it was found that the most damage suffered from fascist-external decorative panels and isolation.
The British police have said they believe that the London Grenfell Tower isolation and facade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Look: These phones will probably get sales cards in autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for technical lovers, as telephone manufacturers will reveal their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were on sale, and in the autumn, new hit phones were expected to be available.
According to Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, the street flagship is characterized by the innovative design, eye-catching scanner, a 4K screen and a supermarket processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also come to the front of the Estonian smartphone sales cell phones, is a great deal of experience in the technology world.
In the autumn, smart interests allow even more rapid load, more durable battery, more quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that on the basis of hearings, you can already make assumptions and predict four top models that are likely to conquer street sales policies.
These four top models of smartphones are coming to the poles in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the pockets in mid-September.
I don’t know what Apple’s new model looks like and what it can do with it is widespread.
If the iPhone 7 does not bring significant differences alongside the iPhone 6s, Apple’s tenth birthday is expected to get out of the previous model completely.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the new design elements is probably a screen that covers the entire phone's front panel, has been lost the home button and the fingerprinter has been built into the screen.
Apple’s designer JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
It has also been discussed about the ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eyebar scanner, the loading of the lead valve and even more high-quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
This is certainly one of the year’s most awaited smartphones.
The pre-fill of the Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
Probably, even more business users are designed and S Pen enables even greater functionality.
On the phone should have two cameras, one of which is a landing hole and the other a dense view lens.
Nobody knows yet what two back cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is definitely comparable to the iPhone 8.
We are waiting for August 23th.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones in front of the Nokia 6 this year, it still lacks their flagship – Nokia 8, which will be presented on August 16th.
We expect from the Nokia 5.3-inch end-to-end screen and overline Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a durable battery.
For Nokia, it is also mentioned about the aluminum body and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
As with Samsung, Nokia has two rear cameras produced by Zeiss.
When Sony’s sure flagship has already been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added soon, with even more innovative features.
We expect a smartphone, which is a bit more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least the same good or better camera.
Sony’s new model is speculated that its screen is at least six-inch.
What the reality brings, we can see the right head already, as Sony traditionally has revealed its autumn flagship international IFA technology exhibition, which will take place this year on 1-6 September.
Trump pushed Mexican for paying for a border wall
The Washington Post announced telephone transcripts between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian government leaders.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nietole to stop the public announcement that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border office.
The President of the United States threw the wall with him for the public destruction, saying, "You should not tell the press."
Trump urged his presidential campaign to build a wall along the U.S. Southern Border and swore to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also disclosed, which reveals tensioned exchange of thoughts.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees to Australia is "small", "small" and "small". He argued that the agreement made during the Obama government would leave him a "small" impression because he has offered the United States to flee from the United States.
Trump stopped the talk, notifying Turnbull that the action was the most unpleasant talk of the day.
The state court did not take a complaint against OÜ MRP City Lines in a case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus transportation from July 2019 to 2029.
It is a law that rejects the offer of OÜ MRP City Lines to the bus dealer of Tartu, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained the President of the Tartu City Law Service Anneli Apuhtin.
The operation is in Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines complained of the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The state court did not consider it.
Although on social media many are sad that the noise of the Weekend festival disturbs their night and the whole city is full of festivals in drinking, there are also many people who don’t have a bad word to say about the permanent festival on the beach.
I’m even positively surprised that there were so many celebrations in the store!
I haven't seen any disturbance or uncertainty.
I even saw him leaving,” said the heritage Laine.
"It's nice to come, to be, to be and to be known the joy of the Pernus, which has been wintered like a winter winter," he added.
Beach decorated tomatoes Laine and no disturbance.
When he was living in the center of the city, he heard that music was played on the beach, then music has not yet reached his home intensity.
“But I hope I hear,” he says gladly.
Agnes also talked to the evening saying that the Grand Festival is better for Pärnu - it will help the traffic of local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that the summer hall has come so many foreigners.
There's no misunderstanding with the singing woman.
I'm sure I'm not on the beach anymore, but I'm glad that the coast has survived.
“It’s great that people are moving, and it’s been so three times,” the woman says.
For the first time, it was probably a little worse.
"Maybe there were complaints," he thought.
The sound on the beach, however, is common for the summer birds.
"This weekend is a very good promotion for our small town," said Harri, a park-training man.
His lifetime hasn't been thrown into the fire as well.
What's the mission?!
We should all keep together.
Think about how this international communication would be better.
Choose music is not a musician.
It doesn't matter, even though I live there nearby.
“Good people can keep together and there is no harm,” he said.
The guests who came to the village are wise, he said.
"The bottles are also a little too too much, but young people are young and the Lord of God - let them go, but be people, and we can do it," he says.
The coastal residents have traveled somewhere far from this time, whether to their relatives or to their familiar ones.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like such a noise," says Tiina, walking with the children.
His family and festival music did not bother, although last year it was even far from the street.
Last summer there was a lot different, so we heard more.
We live outside of the city that really runs there far by the ends of the Peru River very well,” he says.
Pearson drops another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividend to rebuild business
The British education company Pearson said it would drop another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate divisions by 72%, launching another restructuring program to solve the threatening business insights.
The loss of jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, is highly likely to be assembled at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4,000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced the plan to cut off the third cost reduction programme for another £300 million (394 million US dollars) to try to restore the business that has become a fast digital learning transition due to the hobby.
The company, which agreed to sell the Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said that their expectations in relation to the year have not changed after a sales income 1 percentage increase of £2.05 billion was reported in the first half of the year.
The weather will continue to be warm in the summer with rainfalls.
In Estonia, the weather will be warm in the summer with rainfall on Sunday, and the wind blows are very strong at a time.

Consulate in Kabul: NATO soldier died in suicide bombing
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked military forces in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injured several others.
In a NATO statement, five soldiers and translators were injured.
According to unacceptable local reports, three civilians were killed in an incident in Qarabaghi district.
This bombing was the last of the violent acts that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people died on Tuesday at the Herat Mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO’s statement said that the explosion took place on Thursday night when the joint patrol of the Afghan army was attacked “with a human-made explosion body.”
All injured in a stable state and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), is a constantly growing source of concern for NATO forces in Qarabagh Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, approximately 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul, mainly in the Shiidist district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a large bombing bomber killed more than 150 people in the center of the city - it has led to the most deaths in the country since the U.S.-led forces pulled out of the Taliban in 2001.
This violence stresses the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump considers whether to increase the number of US military and police aid forces.
According to the correspondents, suicide events in Kabul in recent weeks have also contributed to the public confidence crisis against the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA cancels the decision of delaying the law after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cancelled the decision to delay the adoption of a Obama provisional regulation obliging the state to limit the emissions caused by the suture, one day after 15 states complained to the agency due to this process.
The EPA announced the decision to continue on Wednesday with "2015. a determining ozone content" in saying that it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe that we need to dialogue with our partners and listen to them," EPA CEO Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA intends to delay the determination of ozone concentrations in which the suture resistance is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to comply with the harder air quality standard.
The 15 main democratic states, together with the Columbia District, filed a complaint on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has attempted to retract several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, is part of a broader growth market plan.
But these efforts have caused contradictions among the Democrats and the natural protection groups, who are worried about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website wrote that inhalation of air containing ozone "can reduce lung working capacity and increase the risk of diseases in respiratory pathways" such as as asthma.
German pigs may have a party.
German pigs and chickens may come to a party, as strong rains threaten the European Union's second seed producer, Bloomberg writes.
The street may go so that the frequency that took weeks before the harvest could mean that the fruit intended for the breeding industry was only fed for animals.
"Its quality is far worse than it was in 2015 and weaker than it was," said analyst Agravis Raiffeisen, Bernhard Chilla.
The street can go up to 40% of German wheat for animal feeding, twice as much as usual, according to Agravis.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have faced all kinds of weather today.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by the hot spring in June.
In July, Germany has experienced incidents, which have also continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to North Sahara, where rain prevents hunting.
Only five percent of wheat has been used so far.
Most of the region has not yet started the collection, local purchaser Ceravis reported.
“That’s a very difficult day,” said Ceravis’s elderly dealer Frank Deckert Rendsburg.
Compatibility in everything, i.e., the Finnish interior design plans
Beautiful nature plays its role in the interiors of the mexicans, as through large windows, the views of the so-called Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, the efforts of our North Neighbors to create both hard and perfect (energy-saving) homes simultaneously.
The use of wood for Finns as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty is worthy of smoking and observation.
Virgin keys and smart solutions are found in the messaging machines by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is evident that black, white and shadowful compositions, if they are supplemented by wood tones and garden plants, may be very humorous.
Good ideas can go to school for another week, as the fair will last until August 13.
Accessories and bowls suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
Tonight, I took the line under the Weekend Festival Balticule, and Martin Garrix made everything he could to remember as the last person.
When Garrix was present, the people were really turning around - singing, crying, danced in a self-sacrificing way.
When Garrix finished, a common mass lighted across the city from the beach of Pärnu.
We will bring you to a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer caught on the weekend for three days.
You're sure you're some of them, look up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meets for the first time, discussing possible opposition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to go to the correspondence in the nearest poximatch of the nearest, up to 66.7 kg in weight-loss categorie, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unwinnable World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked on the other side to welcome Lomachenkot, the World Boxing Organization closing champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision, the victory over the former four-time world champion Adrien Broneri on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are part of the first debtor's debut.
Garcia lifted his right hand and said, "How are you going, champion?
I'm looking for success."
Lomachenko protects his feet against Miguel Marriah on Saturday evening at 19 p.m. in the ESPN.
When a couple of photos were posed, Lomachenko's machinery Egis Climas noted that there would be a "perfect measurement" between possible fighters.
"I'm an ex-man," Garcia recalls.
“I went up for the Broner [63.5 kg], but I’m not so big.
I'm 63.5 pounds.
I want to move down lightweight.
And he must move up to lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans wanted it.
So let's offer it to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world needs this fight."
The climate raised the question of whether it should be paid. This is part of its strategy, according to which she wants to let Lomachenkol debute at the end of this year in the 61.2 kg class to make a next summer possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 November), who also have the interest in the Forum after September 23 to fight with them at Jorge to Linarelise Camp and Lukelise.
"The viewing of this fight could be fee because the fans wanted this opposition," Garcia said later, saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main strategies.
No other name can pay so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said she thought Lomachenko would be "a powerful fighter" and could go to look at his Saturday match.
However, Lomachenko was humble when he praised Garcia, saying that his opinion looked like the master of three divisions from Riverside "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted to fuck it."
Garcia said it was intended to demonstrate strike and then poke.
Both confirmed that they feel the tension to increase between them.
“This is a fight that expects realization.
No one in each other draws so much attention and attention.
I am more than willing to work for that,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
That’s a good fight.”
Which world wars will be moved to Estonia?
The Police and Border Supervisory Office (PPA) has extended and issued recording more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country citizens who have mainly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, if the mule was decided to issue a deadline residence permit to 6702 foreign landscapes, then the mule was 4928.
Offices cannot tell how many immigrants finally remain to Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia 10 years ago, that number will be nearing 2000 in recent years.
The number of residence applicants increased jumping during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 they received a deadline residence permit of 1087 people, a year before 675.
According to the Statistics Agency, the number of Ukrainians in Estonia is increasing most - the number of Ukrainians arrived in Estonia with more than 850 Ukrainians left.
“The community of Ukraine has been great all the time in Estonia and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are being searched for a country where the community and many families are already in front of,” said Kristin Rammus, the Minister of Interior Press.
Mullu and tunamullu were even greater than the number of Ukrainian citizens of Russia, although in the course of ten years the most deadline was issued for the last residential permits.
If the Ukrainians come here mainly for work, then Russian citizens for family immigration.
"In view of this historical Russian community, they are more likely to have the largest family connections with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, immigration scientists at the Academy of Internal Protection.
"When you see where the citizens of Russia who have been allowed to live in Estonia, then after Haruma is the East Viruma," he added, and he stressed that about 40 percent of them have married a European citizen.
Mullu received a deadline residence permit in 1696 a Russian citizen, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits decreased.
"It is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia instead of extending the residence permit," said Rammus, Minister of Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia has been stable for years.
A new residence permit permanently in Estonia will be able to apply for foreigners living here for at least three years from last year.
Its aim is to encourage adapted people to stay here.
For example, a long-term resident requires a residence permit for five years.
After the new residence permit, the old residence permit has also been extended.
For example, a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now Ukrainians can exchange work, and the Estonian state will no longer take time to follow whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became highly popular - the applicant was much more hall passport owners (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of the residents in Estonia were allowed to live in 1968, including 23 other Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
Within ten years, Nigeria has become a state of surprise whose citizens are one of the most active Estonian residents.
When three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians in 2007.
To learn from Nigeria to colleges.
Also, Estonian high schools are popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has grown largely thanks to their education.
It also applies to them the rule that where the community has emerged, it is easier to meet others,” Rammus added.
Over the course of ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If a residence permit is granted to approximately 6000 citizens of a third country per year, it is approximately 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union believe, immigration remains about a percentage,” Maasing said in a statement.
According to the Statistics Agency, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia, and 13,792.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of immigration.
Most of the expatriates and in-houses are Estonian citizens, but more are among them.
Therefore, the immigration balance of the Estonian citizens was in 2,000 people.
The Estonians migrate in particular between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princessmeon has a lot of joy, joy, and sadness.
For Maria Tammeoru, however, there is an irrelevant idea of history - old paintings and costumes: "I have spent hours dreaming somewhere in the museum and admiring old gloves and shells.
If you’re doing something, you’ll study and learn about it every day.
It's a pleasure to discover!
The glamour world of Mamma Couture may appear in some aliens, but the designer does not think so.
You decide how much light is in your life.
I have a friend with a healthy sauna full of my high couture dresses.
Because it’s not his fault that he doesn’t live in Hollywood and doesn’t walk in red spirit every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful clothes and wear them!
You can live your own life in a special way!
The artist does not recognize the breakthrough between the radiant events and the archipelago day.
That is the reason why the plan was to bring the highway into Estonia, between forests and lands, to people whose fashion often fails to reach.
Mommy’s collection was introduced, for example, at the Võrus, Juhvis and Pärnu modealle, where the 45-model royal defile was full of the whole street.
In Tallinn, a shop is often taken in, encouraged worthyly, but elsewhere there are more emotions - calling braavo, rising up, wanting to thank you with a towel.
Most of the audience had the same news, but now they are Mammu Couture's fans.
If you exceed the expectations of people, they are spirited!
And I like it feels like I'm in my fashion like a summer nightmare.
We had a 50 metres long red sheet, full of beautiful street dresses, seemed to have no end!
Maria also does not recognize that the creation must present a supersale supermodel, she loves to bring ordinary women to the lake.
I often invite my own customers to the table - they have always come with joy.
It's a great experience, you can shine on the label in a wonderful dress!
I’m so sorry I’ve never seen my progress myself, I’m always behind me to give the last ease as an unholy perfectionist to things.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to look calmly on the floor.
Mary is a fashion designer who wants not only to play the role of representation, but also to be in all of the handles.
I'm in my studio, most of the collection I'm doing myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I'm never far from my life, and I'm not afraid of work.
With the design, the thing is not limited to, even stylist, logistics, organization, organization - everything must take away the day of a temperamental woman.
These hours of work are still great for fans.
I can't tell when my workday ends, for me, it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very excited - it's like an uncomfortable happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and in turn still compliments.
How many times have been told that my dresses have magic - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The luxurious saddle that made Maria famous over the night of a talent have remained as a sign of Mammu Couture.
Martin Müürsepp U18 boys: the Estonian sub-group tournament gun turned against us now
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
The first thing was that we couldn't put our table in our hands.
And if there is so much difference in the table, there's nothing to do," commented the Estonian U18 basketball stores 61:75 to the UK, our only basketball player played in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack period, and so much more attacks.
We weren’t ready to protect them or attack them, it created.
Many British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build protection.
But in the defense, they were able to hold their hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
That made the team's feet underneath.
Homework was better done.
According to Mursepa, Estonia should make more tactical mistakes in order to cut off the opposite.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but the opponents already got a number of quick ears.
The athletics and dense rise, which was in our subgroup tournament, has now turned all against us.
We had no strength against their aggressiveness today.
Mursepp stayed calm with Matthias Tass in Kalevis with his care.
In general, the tournament can say good news about the whole team, and it has been a single hit to this day.
Unfortunately, such an aggressive opponent has already been met.
The cup has been self-confidence all the time and played out its own today, but it seemed to have been tired - she has carried a lot of burden.
But she did a few beautiful movements that I’ve seen in the training before,” the instructor added.
Terrifying numbers: The EM tournament has three quarters with less than 10 points in their earballs.
The U18-age class is not only a basketball tournament for youths in the EM B Division in Tallinn, but they began to cross-country in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland is a custom in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but even after the third quarter, it was 9:49, perhaps only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took the leg from the gas bike, and the period remained at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, in the third one point...
At the same time, the Estonians struck two of the first two pieces in the first two minutes, and 25 pieces in the game, then one into three and then 21 other pieces in the game.
Maybe in almost an hour, one of 47 was tapped.
In addition, two points came from four free.
At that time, the number of shootings was reasonable, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland's match was 33 percent and Estonia was 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two losses, and on the opening day it was necessary to recognize Portugal’s 83:56 best.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to supplement equipment
Today, NATO's 1st Permanent Minerary Group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend to complete the ship's supplies and prepare for the following exercises.
During the visit, vessels prepare to return to the sea and give crew members the opportunity for a pair of day holidays.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonia to carry out several exercises and be prepared for future searching for historical explosive bodies.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the interoperability training carried out by them in the local waters shows well our integration with the Allied Forces," said Captain Arto Rhinemaa, the chief of the Operations and Planning Division in the Navy's missions.
Since June 29, NATO's 1st Permanent Navy Mining Group is headed by Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the tasks of the group leader held in Riya from the Estonian Navy Commander Johan-Elias Seljama.
The group’s flagship is designated by the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsite, which also operates the group’s leadership level.
This semester is also part of the composition of the International Unit of the Estonian Navy Minor Sakala.
One of the four ships under NATO Marine Command is NATO's first permanent mining group, amongst the first quick reactors, a ready-made unit, which the alliance can send to different locations in the world within five days.
By August 13th, the ancient herds of the Pirita monastery will again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, called by the Special Class Master, will be held 13 years ago.
Today’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Tallinn’s artistic director Risto Joosti (36).
Risto Joo: The listeners reach the classics of the opera world belong to "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet showcases from the snowy "Bolerost" fun "Karlssonini" and also lacks a plan of self-production, for which at this time is the release of the "Anniversary" of Hay's Wonderful Oratorium to the same men in the 2015 year of the other pirates.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre shows.
It is larger than any music theater in its normal form.
It’s a festival that takes power and never leaves it open again.
Because the experience that a listener becomes in this upper and mysterious environment makes human souls sound and relates to human beings in a way that is impossible to describe.
You've been the artist of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did Master Eri Class shoes feel a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klass, I had a lot of help.
He led me through my entire student career and also supported the management career at the beginning.
Maybe because of this, I have been easier to continue his work.
Special Class has injected the Birgitta Festival team so much of goodness and, of course, it all brings about me too.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
Just the great heart of the Special Class also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Filharmonia.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What would you like to encourage the public on the streets of the festival that you are offering?
We have an artist from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise, the first ballet to be presented in the museum, written by Astrid Lindgren.
This is "Karlsson Flying".
And one of the curious nuances in this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian helicopter Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He probably had the character of Karlsson since he was a kid.
Risto, how are you doing it all?
Thanks to my supporter, I'm sure.
This work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have it with a kid.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend on any other person, as much as I’m, or how I’m going to face every new day.
And keeping such a conscious tone, keeping positive and actually smiling in a mirror from the morning, significantly raised my happiness.
Especially this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practiced it particularly agarously and it works.
Smiling itself activates the brain and increases the tone.
It's not just vocabulary.
I think people still don’t know half the things of their body what the universe offers to them, but everybody discovers this equally.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before the director's office?
Still, clothes must be replaced with more comfortable ones.
This is a little moment for yourself.
But in general yes, I don’t have the chance to relax or swim before a big appearance.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before the lead-pult arrives.
But come all of Birgitta Festival, here is something to discover not especially for a great opera and ballet friend!
Watch the mood videos from Risto Joos!
New results of Swedish asylum seekers’ age assessment tests were published
A test was conducted among asylum seekers in Sweden during which their age was assessed with new medical approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the tests were assessed older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Judiciary Medicine Institute (Juridical Medicine Network) started tests at the beginning of this year.
Tests were created to assess the age more accurately during the application of asylum after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrations Network) was criticized for the fact that they have not managed to correctly determine the age of several minors.
Currently, the Migrations Network has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Court of Medicine has released a total of 2481 test results from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed for 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases, the Court of Medicine assessed that the testing "may be 18 years or older".
In the case of 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests are used only if a person’s age is under a questionnaire.
According to Johan Göransson, who worked at the Court of Medicine Institute, the results are consistent compared to the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference in comparison to statistics in the past six months, the numbers are quite consistent," she told The Local.
The fact that much of the cases were considered older than 18 does not imply that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute released May 581 test results and said in 442 cases, "I have references to the fact that the person investigated is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of the 581 tests, it found that 243 cases had been directly claimed that it would get 18 this year.
This method of medical age evaluation, during which intelligent X-ray images and MRTs of knees are made, and then let them be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Karolinska Institute’s endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose tasks include an assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether they had passed puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I have had a reason to think about it and I don’t think the measurement method is currently being used.
Determining biological age in such a way is very uncertain.
"If we can't say it, we shouldn't see that we can," he said.
But Johan Göransson at the Institute of Justice Medicine defended the precision of tests: "Generally, it can be said that the risk of unprecedented adult dismissal of the child is low.
The highest at about 10% is the risk if a person is under 18.”

The 20-year-old summer rider Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debtor at the London MM, getting 67.37 good 18th place.
Orel was the youngest woman’s MMi, and the happy woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64,80) I immediately made my average score, the second (62,80) I risked too much and the third (67,37) I could keep my head clear," Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my shirts and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli MMi debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rainfall of Orelit wasn't confused because he trained the winter at the TTU stadium.
"I'm fucked," he said with a little bitch.
At the London Olympic Stadium, Orel had almost a full house of people, was Orel aware of people around himself or was able to unlock himself?
I realized, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says that it gives it - so is!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he remains in peace with the MMi debtor and that he is still waiting for a lot of good competitions: "I came here with the last result of the 32rd season, maybe, I finished at 18th.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and I'm the only one who reads.
I have a good experience and I want to play on behalf of medals for a few days.
Western Virgin Governor announces party exchange
Governor Jim Justice, a Western Virginia Democrat, said on Thursday evening meeting with President Trump that he would exchange parties.
"Whether you like it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I tell you, having prayed and thought about it... today I tell you, Western Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic cubier."
At the meeting, the joys were revolted.
"So I'll be republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you that it's time to play the second game."
Trump had promised a big announcement before the gathering of West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, has been elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he belongs to the stones in five states and that he really belongs to his father's stones.
Its value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday night that "the party exchange of Governor Justice is a second hit to a democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from becoming better again than working on it."
"From all 15 cube places and control over the lowest number of states in history - the Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent resignation to the party from the end to the end, not being able to find positive and connecting messages," RNC Chief Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It’s not surprising that there are many people, there are also many injured people.
On the weekend, Urmet at the medical office told the nightmare that they had to distribute the plasters quite a lot.
Wilds and marrows are basic, outweighing and light flowers.
Of course, head, back and legs.
According to Urki, visitors will come to the festival with false legs and such problems will come.
The media have also had to assist a couple of visitors with larger injuries - there have been some panic halls and also one footnote.
We’ve also made an injury when a person has broken his hand or his finger.
The smaller we'll do here, the bigger we'll get to the hospital.
Look at the video if party men are also asking pain agents to treat baseline.
Coe thanked Russians for the Doping Channel
Sebastian Coe, an international singer of light power, praised his words for the doping channel for "Friday's Honest Excuse from Russia," but repeated that it's not time to let the country go back to sports.
Russian light force Dmitry Shylakhtin said light force was held at the IAAF conference on the evening of the world championships that the ban on the competition imposed on his country is right and is determined to fight doping.
He apologized for "all lightweight glasses whose hands were pressed on gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, IAAF's Congress voted for leaving a ban on competition imposed in November 2015 after the report of the World Antidoping Agency (WADA) found evidence of the country-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was today with a very honest answer, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told journalists.
"The Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian alliance also recognized themselves that they had quite difficult times and they do everything possible to restructure the alliance."
Coe said he was also pleased to accept Russia’s own prediction criteria.
“I think it was a very constructive day today and a progress is taking place, but the Congress supports the working group’s proposal that it is currently not the right time to withdraw Russia,” Coe said.
“We have to do all we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
"We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the broken system," he added.
Sixteen Russian lightweight champions who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF are competing as neutral athletes at the London lightweight championships.
Rune Andersen, Chairman of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia does not meet a number of predictive criteria yet.
Following the proposal made to the IAAF Council, he stated to London’s journalists that doping control is still inadequate and that trainers who have been banned are still acting freely.
The revolution of electric cars significantly alters the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
A little of the fact that the revolution of electric cars significantly changes all of the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they win one place and lose the other, smaller mining companies do not help.
Currently, Glencore serves stone and oil, but in the era of electric cars, the cobalt, lithium, vase, aluminium and nickel is growing.
This year, the decisions of the United Kingdom, France and Norway to prohibit the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades have increased.
Sestap has already announced that Volvo plans to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring the cheaper Model 3 electric car on the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts, electric cars have been sold in more than two decades.
“As for some metals, this changes everything,” said Simona Gambranin Bloomberg, a raw analyst in Capital Economics.
We have already seen a large impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
Electric cars are approximately three times harder than normal cars, Glencore said.
There is still more need for charging stations, so Exane BNP Paribasi estimates that this will increase vase demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore is becoming the largest cobalt manufacturer in the world, according to Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, other winners of electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
Today, the cobalt on the London Metal Exchange has increased by 70%.
The price increase was 37%.
The cow has also collapsed by 14 percent, mainly due to growth.
Glencore's shares rose by 20 percent in London, overwhelming Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billitoni and Anglo American.
On the other hand, the losers have businesses like Recyclex and Campine, who need to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of Pli is the power-driven batteries for motor and diesel engine car starters.
Electric cars use lithium ions.
"This is a serious risk for the need for swelling unless other purposes are found to overcome the decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, Metal Market Analyst of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the face of the Pli price movement, the impact of the open-roll trend is not yet noticed.
Plii has been the highest 17 percent of the street, with the highest price rise among the main industrial metals in London.
Investors will see problems with metal only in the far future.
“I’m not sure that it’s so bad for pillows because cheap oil keeps normal cars in competition,” said Metal Maker Company Triland Metals, Herwig Schmidt.
When the demand for the bulbs climbs, it takes place slowly.
This might happen in about 10 years.
The tougher emissions standards, however, mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on the pile-based batteries developed in frequent engines, is assessed by the International Pile and Zinc Research Organization.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive less electrically farther.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand for 2013-2016.
It represents 2.7 percent of the world's total production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to deepen, Widmer said.
Aluminum has increased by 13 percent in the streets, as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
The terrace producer doesn't sleep.
AK Steel Holding collaborates with General Motor to use nanotechnology for the production of immeasurable cars.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter steel welding to resist aluminum mills.
"The overwhelming steel should be a response to this development," said Exane BNP Paribasi analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There are some successes in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also cause suffering to the plane.
Around half of this was used to be the catalyst of cars with diesel engines, metal refiner Johnson Matthey said.
“Some people with high demand of raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have a high demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahdah, Natixis’ raw materials analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore’s leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars are still being sold.
In a 10-year-old perspective, the large hope of the plateau manufacturers is that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motosi are cars based on hydrogen, which depend on the plateau to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
"The diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road towards electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribas Brunet.
In July, German car manufacturers became part of a major relapse because the Stuttgart court prohibited the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar transition in Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unprogrammed consumption of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record transition from Spain's football club to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any consequences from the UEFA, the leading body that dominates the European game and whose ability is to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is only waiting.
The fair financial rules of the game (FFP) established by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must prove that Neymar’s transition was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) only for buying Brazil from its contract, and Neymar's salary will start to reach tens of millions of dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of transferring Neymari to the club in France.
The PSG has undoubtedly the possibility of spending such money on Neymar's burning and adding to his star-drawing line, given that the team is funded by a family governing Qatar's energy-infractor.
The clubs are allowed to spend lots of money on the players, but they must balance it with legal income sources that allow them to get out of the football club with their own.
The FFP founded Michel Platin after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who fall in search of success in large debts actually engage in fraud and risk deposits if banks or owners should give up support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring their losses instead of club debt.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential and then make high expenses to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which lasts up to 2018, the clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the shameful exclusion of Platinum from the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive consumption.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will continue to strengthen these rules," said Andrea Traverso to The Associated Press, a FFP follower at the UEFA last week.
Although the PSG paid for Neymar's supervision clause as an integral part, it is possible to divide this amount into parts for accounting purposes throughout the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement, which is therefore possible to indicate the transitional fee in the next five years as a sum of EUR 44,4 million per year.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties in the neck of Manchester City.
The PSG was allocated EUR 60 million (at the moment $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to restrict the Champions League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to plan over regulatory financial institutions by increasing their revenue through the club owner-related companies.
The company of Qatar may sponsor PSGs, but if the sponsorship value is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the support of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was upheld.
It has been said that some part of the Neymar PSG service can come from Qatar through the 2022 World Cup Management Committee’s payments.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 ignore that Neymar could be made from the world championships and claim that UEFA regulators would be able to easily disclose such a manufacturing.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more careful to ignore the rules of any effort.
People who are familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed PSG transition with Neymar.
They talked to The Associated Press provided that they are guaranteed their anonymity because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned more than 10 million euros for the 2015-2016 season with a VAT of around 542.4 million euros.
The data of the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a good impact on sponsorship, trade and radio sales.
The club expects to increase at least 30% in terms of the contract.
Too much of Spain, being clearly irritated by the departure of one of the biggest football players, Neymar tried to prevent the transition, claiming that the PSG violated the FFP.
“This is a clear case of “financial doping” with the club and the country,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, pointing out that the PSG is mainly part of Qatar.
Arsenal engineer Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sportsman, shares La Liga warning that the state funds the club.
"This is the consequence of ownership and has completely changed the entire football field over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the game since the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player in the country.”
Norwegian’s low cost airline is a good tradition to put pictures of those who have destroyed the borders in their field and have been inspired by others, writes trip.ee.
Along with Norwegian geography’s expansion, the circle of people on the airfield has also expanded.
Among the selected characters include Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (picture) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, one aircraft will be decorated by Queen's legendary singer Freddie Mercury portrait.
Today 50 years ago: the worst hurricane storm in Estonia, which cut from houses roofs and windows.
The storm of the centuries called the hurricane, which injured on 6 and 7 August, causing significant damage, especially to the West, Harjumala and Raplama.
Southern Estonia was at a speed of over 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran in the house from one card tree to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and bright, like the end of the world.
The roofs were already flying from houses, and in 2002, old lady Linda Kurova recalled the interview given to the newspaper Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw her own sealed garden crashing together.
But what do you still hold with your hands, where you get that tower?
The sea came down from the window, and the water went in from the window,” said Mrs. Linda Kalda in the street.
The fact that the road was full of trees and the roof of the railway station was flying 20-30 meters away, Linda saw most of the sharks just the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were natural in the land, some totally squeezed, some half.
All looked very depressed, the storm walked from beautiful old trees with a rainbow and a pragina like a war.
Western Virumaa was unable to suffer particularly severely from the August Tower of 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were also great there, wrote the Virumaa Official Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park have been swept from the ground, but also our car parks have suffered strongly.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured to speed up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the 6th of August, one of the small plikatirts in Tallinn cried out: "Mommy, mommy!
The candles are in the air and can't be lowered anymore!", wrote Virumaa Official Journal.
The building in Poully’s wildlife was lost during the storm so that it was decided to break down later.
There was no resistance to the constructions of the Türkiy's mouthpiece, which would no longer be restored later.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star magazine wrote that the depletion of cities and landscapes from decayed trees and their caves slowly progressed, and the inhabitants could be devastated by decoration.
In the Torms, fruit fruit was also hard to suffer, and the newspaper stated that "partial organizations must be both in order to organize and in order to use fruit as an inspiration and guidance."
Hurricanes can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The wind record in Estonia remains from 2 November 1969 when Ruhnul was measured at a speed of 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, the measurement was broken, so the speed of the wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean supplers: night decorations and weak beach world
The coldest summer airlines also mean smaller decorative Tallinn.
“If there is no one, people will be on the beach, and if there is no one, people will not be on the beach.”
North-Tallinna Streom beach is a shaking cake.
They offer melodic competition on low-round tractors that can cut off the beach trip.
In fact, the last seven centimeters deeply pass through the flood, repairing the seafood and the people’s left-down rice: bottles, cigarettes and other.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is hot or not.
If the weather is beautiful, people are on the beach, and if it is not, people are not,” said Alexander Usov, chairman of decorative works at Haabersti Haldus Beach.
It is 6:30 p.m. and the beach runs a fiber decoration work, as 8 p.m. the place must be fine for people.
The e-mail is already at 4 p.m.
Beyond Streom, she keeps her eyes on the Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Palya Island of the Long Beach.
Prygic doses have decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
“People are now able to evaluate what they are doing for them,” Usov, who has been decorating the mind for 15 years.
Before it was so that if something new came up, it was already broken the next day.
Now we're keeping what's on the beach.
Pure Beach Price
One of the greatest works on the coast of Estonia is the sharp seafood on the beach, i.e. the seafood.
For example, on the beach of Pirita, 400,000 tons must be transported beyond the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," said Usov.
The second major category is the form of an oblivion, that is, all that people have lost.
A half-kilometer coastline on the Stroom coast has eight large bridge containers, which are required to be cleared three times a week.
So much is happening.
However, the coldest summer worlds have meant that the brick is less than five percent than otherwise.
The third species forms lost things.
Most of these are children's toys.
This time, Usov is a dozen of models that have been cooled out of the fleet.
They will stay awaiting the late framework of the beach.
"Usually they get out more, but it's normal." Usov already knows that soon he'll find them out of the cave again.
Children come to the beach and take toys to get them into the boat again.
Breaks are widely kidnapped
Representative of Haabersti’s administrative services Erika Scholler acknowledges that the tractor’s driving work is disturbed by locals.
The noise, which lasts from early morning to early morning, mixes the wounds of people living nearby.
This work is impossible on the day.
In one month, the coast must be crossed twice.
"If we don't do that, then the city will get us worried," Scholler says.
However, the purpose is similar to Pirita, Pikakari, and Pärnugo to also get the Straum Coast under the international blueprint quality mark.
"In comparison with Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to maintain the beaches," Scholler says.
We have more sharp and stones, and it's harder to walk.
However, there is less crust on our coast than elsewhere in Europe.
Having heard that the beach is talking about a rush, Martin, who lives near the beach of Stroom, is uncomfortablely sitting in a conversation circle of journalists and decorators, highlighting the current narrow places on the beach.
The morning is a beautiful picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottles that have pulled the bottles,” Martin said.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their former behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will take something in the gates and put them on punishment, for example, to prevent at least birds from being renewed there.
In general, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroom Beach.
You can see that the city is taking care of it.
With children's fields, lighted and freshly asphalted teas, it has become more pleasant.
It was once so that the rollers were only able to ride one way,” Martin said.
Earth Fuel Finds Stroomis: coins, only coins
In the morning, the 40-year-old Dimitri has been used by the metal detector.
He doesn’t think he’ll find anything worth today or in the future.
The fishermen aren't good enough to do this.
“I’ve been dealing with it a year and haven’t found anything worthwhile yet,” Dmitri said.
A hobby fuel in the Dmitri earthquake is some euro coins, bottles orgasms and also dangerous nails that are subsequently shattered.
Normally there are still coins.
"There are usually no gold, fingers, and other shells," said Earth heater.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at a level, as unforgiving growth and the reduction in inflation have softened speculations regarding rise.
The Bank of England has warned that growth remains a burden because the revenue of farms has put interest rates in expectation.
The monetary policymakers of the Bank (MPC) voted for keeping at 0.25% at the level of 6:2 and fewer members require an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank dropped the growth forecast of 1.7% in 2017 and the growth forecast of 1.6% in 2018, warning that the pressure on the income of farms will remain, as in autumn inflation is still expected to rise close to 3%.
At the same time, the bank also noted that rate growth will be necessary for planning inflation due to Brexit over the next couple of years, and it may be necessary to increase the expected lending costs in the financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago for the partial withdrawal of the brexit-based breach-marketing pack.
In February, the Bank will end the deadline of funding, offering cheap funding to banks, although it has said it is now expected to offer an increase of £15 billion under the scheme, which is worth £15 billion.
The Bank said in its decision-making protocols: "The average MPC forecast will remain inefficient in the near future, as the difficult situation of real income in farms will also have an impact on the future consumption."
As regards the rates, it is repeated that it is necessary to "attrace some effort in monetary policy" in order to mitigate inflation and to "a bit greater" than expected in the markets.
Börs currently predicts the first rise in the third quarter of the following year and the second rise in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all types of jumps are gradual and limited.
Reduced growth forecasts in the bank for this and for the next year are comparable to the forecasts of May 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained.
After this news, the price of the pound fell to the dollar and the euro.
Nael falls 0.5% to US$1.31 and 0.4% to US$1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent growth indicators producing disappointment, which has distorted growing expectations in relation to an increase in GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months by 0.2% above 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to grow a little bit.
The latest inflation report of the Bank gave a few reasons to enjoy growing inflation and unpaid wage rise to farmers suffering from bread, saying that the situation is going to get a bit worse before it gets better.
It was added that monetary policy could not be avoided in the next couple of years, but a noticeable recovery of wages is expected at the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to some pounds, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partially compensates for lower consumer expenditure.
The decision will come a year after the rates were taken in August after 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, causing a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely to take four years to fully engage in prices and economics.
Before the bank’s last decision, it was to feel increasing demand for rate rising as inflation had increased pressure on farmers in terms of bread; in July, three policy makers demanded a rate rising by 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank's message was unexpected and the next few months is expecting a rise again.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to a 2-percent goal was completely caused by weakness.
Coreco’s CEO Andrew Montlake said: “In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, the hypothesis market appears to be increasingly competitive, as lenders injure work and hope to end the year positively.
Börs appears to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are beginning to end, since refinancing, often at service-free and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS has prescribed 10,000 people contrary to HIV drugs
Since September, patients have access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment after the Supreme Court has been detained to determine whether NHS should finance the drug.
NHS England reported that national healthcare is now making estimated 10,000 pre-exposure profilaxis (PrEP) available during the initial three-year clinical trial, which has shown a decrease in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in people with high risk.
NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year that NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite its claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
NHS England’s CEO Simon Stevens welcomed it as a "new extensive intervention" on Thursday, while the National Aids Fund (NAT) described it as a "reverse moment".
Sexual intercourse clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program of April 2018 runs everywhere in England.
Pre-deficiency prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV drug cell that is taken prior to an intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people with risk of infection.
Taking PrEP prior to intercourse means that there are enough medications in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken every day or at least two hours before the procedure.
Suitable candidates include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners have been infected with HIV or are treated.
Clinics identify suitable people who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partner is unable to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will be able to register in a local sexual age clinic involved in the program as well as their participation.
The program pays 10 million pounds and NHS England signed an agreement to get drugs this week after the international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to evaluate the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of whose medicine is intended and how it is consumed and implemented in a large image.
Stevens said: “This new extensive intervention should complement and strengthen the widespread and always successful fight against HIV spread.
“This is another post for over three decades in combating one of the biggest health problems of humanity.”
Deborah Gold, CEO of the NAT, said: “This is a reverse moment in the fight against HIV.
If this is correctly targeted to those who need it and belong to a risk group, the PREP offers an opportunity to change the UK's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and is not dependent on negotiations with their partner, thus improving many lives.
We welcome this warning warmly.”
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “It is now important to ensure that a clinical trial is quickly delayed across the country and that no HIV risk group member will be left behind.
Now that PrEP’s clinical trial has been purchased, we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people with a risk of HIV infection.
Public Health Warrior Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very delayed after six months of delays and the government’s legs collapse.
The evidence shows how many changes this drug can lead to the end of HIV prevention and its live infection spread.
This clinical trial leads us step by step closer to the full understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is important that a clinical trial be taken over the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and bring us closer to stop HIV spread in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, but Latvia and Lithuania declined.
In July, the difference in stock prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 compared to EUR 7.71 in the street in June, Elering said.
The main reason for price difference is the Lithuanian-Sweden community’s wealth.
In Estonia, the average exchange rate of electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt hour last month, and the price was 12 percent light compared to June.
Latvia and Lithuania fell by 5 per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the Nord Pool electricity exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 per cent.
Between Estonia and Finland, the electricity moved 75 per cent from last month to Estonia and 16 per cent from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percentage of the hours between the two countries did not take place the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, the electricity moved 99 per cent of the time from Estonia and 73 per cent of the hours had total transmission power.
According to transactions carried out on the last day of July, the Nasdaq OMX market may be approximately EUR 34 per hour in August and EUR 37 per hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affected by the electricity production price rose last month and the transactions took place at a price of EUR 5.04-5.47 per ton.
High residence - half floor and smart designs have transformed this small Earls Court's apartment's home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate editor, exchanged his big Knightsbridge home against Earls Court’s apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags and the apartment is a reward for a new design.
"Before it, I lived with my former living boyfriend at Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
“I’ve been looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offer.
It was shown to me in Earls Court's apartment and it had similar high tables.
I loved it and offered it the same day.”
Since its first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has been through a complete innovation hub.
At the beginning, it was an apartment with a single bedroom and a complex placement - to reach the sleeping room came walking through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a warehouse and a half floor to use high layers.
“I wanted high lakes, large windows, lots of light.
These were my demands,” he said.
He hired the architectural and design center at Erfan Azadi Notting Hill, Duck & Shed, to use 3.8 m high buildings and build a house that was not just a developmental object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The lake was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-storey where it could stand.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The metal construction is quite complicated," she explains.
“We had to reorganize spaces so that they would be placed on each other without worshiping.
It was not just the construction of a platform, but we used the steel structure to make the height of both the upper and bottom space right.”
This setting enabled Erfan to create room on two full heights along with a lot of dramatic elements.
From the semi-corner, with an old vacuum light opens to the glamour living room under the window of Retrouviuse.
The golden furniture with mirror surface, silver details and the back-end Serge Mouille's light emphasizes the room style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and light.
In both sections of the short corridor, mirrors are added to make it feel longer.
The kitchen leaves the window open in the second room behind the mirror.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage place for all Joanne's dishes and glasses.
The living room adds a charm to the possibility of closing the kitchen area if it is not used by creating an imagination of a glamorous space.
Cutting-edge kitchens are nothing new.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that it is a lifting door of the garage type.
"There was a little design water," explains Erfan from the stainless steel-sponded MDF.
"It's a counterweight, so it's very easy to melt when it's rejected."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 additional square meters, additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"In the end, the floor is what you sell - or what gives real estate value," Erfan says.
"The reservoir stands in the delayed form of a room and makes calculations based on the floor surface."
Here they have been able to increase the floor by using quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are what you touch and thus help create emotional connections with home," Erfan says.
"You don't love the electrical cable on the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make your heart sound.”
This shows that a good design and an increased surface helps make something stunning from a pretty ordinary apartment.
In fact, they may cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Dan Jensen is a major airliner in Chicago who competes with his colleagues for a job lift.
There is no more than the amount of money earned, and there is no more ethics.
His wife and three children only see a man early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I think it's a business version of the "Cardman" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speechmaner are similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the frame element remains, and the moralistic intention of the filmmakers is increasingly going out.
For a surviving experience, the main child’s disease is cancer.
Now you need to choose between work and family.
A son dreaming of architecture makes his father’s walks to Chicago big buildings to think about really important things, such as faith, goodness, love..., without touching even the disaster of two-towers.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, it appears that filmmakers have come from the purpose of the audience to cry, because even the heartiest spectator can’t keep the pigeons back by seeing the lovely cancer boy’s sufferings.
When a son falls into coma and his situation looks desperate, the father finally understands his work of morality and makes good work to the old man looking for.
Now I'm mistaken with myself - if the film has a happy self, then I'll premeer my transparency after the film's coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the script can praise at least one surprise.
At a moment, there's a doubt that the rest of the coffee is in the air - if your husband calls Dan from the hospital and the man blows in a slow way through the corridor to the back.
But the son has been cured strangely, and although his father has just lost his job, he is even positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of the American drama already very well!
In honor of the truth, the film is well designed, all the necessary elements are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and moral beauty: money is not the most important in life.
The guy brings this movie well in.
Trump’s new staff plans to limit President’s media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new White House staff plans to restrict the current flow of information to President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the leader in a more balanced water.
Here's the interruption of reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House staff chairman John F. Kelly met with high officials on his first working day, he raised a key problem with President Donald Trump in the White House, which he planned to resolve bad information in the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that the information must move through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he shared good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis seems to be quite logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to track Trump’s media consumption.
Trump’s relationship with television has been extending for decades, and now that he’s in the White House, his television practices haven’t been missing anywhere.
"When Trump's candidate was angry after an unfair media discovery, he wanted to show him that he was also revealed in the impactful publications," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that “six former campaigners said Trump’s Twitter practices are the key to ensuring that his personal media consumption also contains a stable song of praise.”
Yeah, well.
But the idea that the habits of using Trump’s Twitter have ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something that the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s lines would have been even worse without their intervention.
We will probably never know about what Trump has not posted.
If his helpers were able to save him or a few times from evil, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from constantly creating a polemist.
Some of the problem is that people in the White House, consisting of competing clicks, are trying to promote their own interests exclusively by transmitting to Trump material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the entire creation, wrote in May to the President about the tendency of advisers to feed with strategically demanding information.
One of the examples that reporter Shane Goldmacher describes is:
"The currents and former Trump suspects say that Trump can respond to the negative press, particularly harmful to information, explosively, taking constraints to explain their source.
It also happened in late February, when someone gave a copy of the website of Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, which accused senior staff deputy Katie Walshi of being the "fountain of the White House".
It doesn’t matter that Johnson has remained blocked on Twitter due to some dismissal or that he has not provided any specific evidence or that he has also filed false charges and retrieve them in the past.
Trump read the article and began to speak about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that the then-time staff Reince Priebus and the White House's chairman Rob Porter "has attempted to set up a system for the management and documentation of Trump's arrival documents".
How did that succeed?
Kelly will try to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will become more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for the impact.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from the capital are not allowed to appear in the fiber.
In the city center of Tallinn there is a lot of music from abroad.
Those with whom the evening magazine spoke, admitted that they were playing in an old town without the city's permission.
For the first time, we found three street musicians near the door of Viru, who had taken the same dog with him.
It was clearly seen that the musicians with embarrassment and explosive clothes were backwards travelers who would spend one shower for a marble.
Despite the outward appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm at the akordion, while one man next to him shook three balls and invited the followers closer.
The third man was sitting next to one of the backpacks and smoking the heart brain himself prepared for a rounded plunger.
These three dogs did not let themselves disturb from the past.
Noemi and the footballers who played the acordion told Bob that they were playing for both fun and money in the streets.
The purpose of the company was to collect tickets on the same night on a ship that traveled to Finland.
Aside from the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for the music of the old town, Noemi and Bob picked up their heads.
First, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and most of them will be granted permissions for a month or something like that.
“There is no reason to pay for that,” Bob explained.
When we got back to the doors of Virus about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and they were going to go.
The company moved to the crossing of backpacks and dogs at the Viru Center.
On the streets of Virus, three half of the young men, one of whom played the viral, the other clarinet, and the third was a frase with an electronic piano.
“We are here to offer people entertainment to distribute music and joy and to make money for fuel and living,” said Mivosh, a pianist.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city government must be permitted to present.
"Of course, we don't have that," he laughed.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
"Of course, when the police come, we'll go to another, but we'll have to try it," he added.
The Estonian Bank purchased in July for EUR 149 million debts in the euro area under the public banking programme, with the central bank’s debts portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not publish any detailed information on the purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained that the Eurosystem’s central banks’ assets plan covers three different purchasing programmes: financial bonds (covered bonds), asset-insured bonds (ABS) and public-insured bonds (PSPP).
The central bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money in another market.
The impact of purchases decreases the production of assets with lower risk, motivating investors to take higher risks.
In general, within the framework of the public debt purchase programme, each central bank acquires debt from its own government and does not purchase debt from other countries.
Since the Estonian State has not issued debts, the Estonian Bank shall make the amount allocated to them within the limits of the so-called replacement.
The positions are also made by central banks in the countries where the supply of corresponding debts to the purchaser is limited.
The Estonian Bank generally acquires debt letters from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
The Estonian Bank has been purchasing bonds under the stock exchange programme since March 2015.
Meanwhile, Elering’s bonds were also purchased, but since June 2016 the Estonian Bank no longer purchased Elering’s bonds.
On behalf of the euro area’s central banks, the Finnish Central Bank has purchased debts from Elering and Estonian Energy since June.
Refugees rejected and relocated to the "millionaire" region
Some of West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have again fallen into a rebellious conflict with strong decision-makers who have defeated the commission's cover-up crash in order to get back to their wings away.
The migrants have parked their 20 hague villas on the rich "restritor of millionaires" near the street of Solihulli.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks after they had just been expelled from there, not allowing themselves to mix the crane in which they were hiding to prevent their invasion by the commission.
The tactical group found a weak place in the protective boundaries, pinching its vehicles through the remaining part that was left on foot.
Maruvian residents have been injured by the Solihulli Commission, saying that the Commission is "unprofitable in dealing with the problems".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after their exile from Bentley Heathi, where they were walking through stones.
The Commission must be ashamed that they begin to act because they have been used to deal with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were supposed to leave and now they are back.
They came here last night, probably even more today.”
"The Birmingham Commission knows how to deal with such things by purchasing long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook road and I am not happy that I have to continue paying taxes if the commission can't even prevent such a thing."
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny. We only saw the last immigrants leave, and there's already a new survey.
This time the number has grown, and the roughness has even been seen in the memory of the horses.”
The Commissioner of Solihulli said: "We are aware that the country near Streetsbrooki road has an unauthorized campsite, and we will cooperate with Solihulli police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
The collection of evidence is very helpful for as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them.”
The weekend festival will also be visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Isar, who is pleased to have been able to bring the real world tops to Estonia.
The question why the Weekend festival is so important for the Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked to all those who enjoy the festival for three days full breasts.
However, he claims that the real factors in his area have come to Persun.
"Looking at the level of artists that are able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this genre are brought home - that often won't happen in our country," the Minister of Culture said.
What artists at the festival are most likely to talk about themselves?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for men like me, it's definitely one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren who rose up last night.
According to his recording, we've all been complicated at some point by ourselves," he said.
However, he brings out several other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course also our own Estonian manufacturers: starting with NOËP and they can be read a whole range.
In fact, the concentration of known names is very large,” he says.
Look at the video of the evening!
Audi Renews Car manufacturers at the center of criticism of up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter variants than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW hometown Munich, which is considering the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions of diesel engines.
No company described these activities as a revocation.
European car manufacturers have advertised the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations laid down on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide separated from diesel engines is considered to be cancerous and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment installed for diesel vehicles to neutralize the air for automotive companies is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars as competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under a thorough investigation, Union Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of shaping the government of powerful car manufacturers and misleading signs of problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the recurring of Volkswagen errors that silenced the use of fraudulent devices that enabled them to adjust the emissions sample to conform to the regulations during the car testing, but retreated in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean investigation.
Last month, Audi was arrested by the former head of the thermodynamic subdivision of the engine development department in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore unprotected from issue and can be judged in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi took a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused the Audit of installing the system to diminish European emissions requirements, expanding the survey that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation can be a large number of luxury car manufacturers generate disproportionately a large portion of Volkswagen’s profits.
Estonian schools will buy the flag of the European Union for EUR 20,000.
The Ministry of Education plans to purchase the flag of the European Union for Estonian schools by 1 September.
A total of 105x158 centimeters will receive 570 European Union flag educational institutions.
The flags are designed to be exposed to interior spaces, they must be carried out in high quality printing spaces with tunnels, the ERR’s newportal mediates.
The label of the flag name is the text: "Conclusion of Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Council of the European Union in Estonia.
The expected cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the cost of the Ministry of Education, or one flag will pay EUR 35.
Reporter’s murder emphasizes the growing risk in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly staff usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to detect the most recent chaos planted by organized crimes, corrupt officials and narcotics warriors.
But today they have gathered a personal tragedy to discuss their safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two elderly writers are discussing what seems safer: whether to bring their children to the office, which was the target of the granate in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the table in front of the room: "enemies", "neutrals", "alliances".
They ask reporters every column names to provide evidence is not necessary, enough of anxiety and insight.
In the case of a government or a cartel wage, the entire list of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected to make the discovery of the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
There are no freedoms of breathing and the more deaths in the country come together, the greater part of them, according to the Journalist Protection Committee, have been in charge of them since the appointment of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been in charge of the state after the attacks and threats of the country, and at least during the period of the year under its national protection.
The last deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce associate Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives deep sense, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the Riodoce building's facade, a large picture of the middle finger displaying Valdez along with the letter "Justness" and two 30th reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts with a more smiling eyebrow with his face or a beacon.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. Reporters are discussing common trauma, their outbreaks, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although in 2010 a separate national prosecutor was established to address the cases of journalists, only two cases were undertaken by the Data Protection Committee.
Like most of the annual drug trafficking and organized crime crimes, whose number ranges to thousands, journalists’ murders are rarely present in court.
The Riodoce operation continues to reveal violence in Sinai, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of the murderers and without justice, Ibarra says there is no great benefit for the meeting on security.
"It's hard to get your time here," he says.
"Until the reason is not known, you'll be pushing everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacani, capital of the state in the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive just a few quarters before two men who had stopped the red Toyota Corolla. He had to leave the car and fired him 12 times. This is probably due to the name of the newspaper, which clearly means "the Twelveth River".
The armed man traveled in the car of Valdez and caused an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
A woman and two adult children were left behind.
Celebrities spread freely in Culiacanis.
However, the issue of Valdes is mainly only in silence.
Since the detention of Guzman last year and the release to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, because rival clicks are fighting for the execution of the power force.
It doesn’t matter that Sinaloa streets leave a number of people or slaughter each day, or that the dead are adorned by the double-decoration of drug kings, which are larger than many living homes.
Let’s just forget that the peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel of a marine state with valuable ports and drug traffic routes to the United States.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers associated with his work, Riodoce’s associate and Chairman Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels a huge meal that he couldn’t protect his friend.
He believes that the killing promoted two mistakes.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez in February with the nine click on the cardile in the military with the sons of Guzma.
This letter could even hate suspicious members of the race to buy all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in the journal journals.
The other mistake was that Valdezi was not forced to leave the country on behalf of his own security after the warning took place in one of the same stories.
Valdez was a legend in both Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence directed against journalists in Mexico.
He was so long alive that his friends and colleagues expected that he would always exist.
In 2003, he worked as a veteran reporter at the Noroeste newspaper, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with the journal without having to deal with a drug problem."
For a period of time, the magazine grew up with its courageous and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew up.
Reporters liked to publish powerful surveys without fear of censorship and readers in a loud press, from which they were able to read stories that nobody else had dared to reflect.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for his Latin American treasures.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Committee (AKK) award for his courage to follow the Mexican narcoology wherever it leads.
He clearly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told TV TV Rompeviento that drug trafficking is a lifestyle in Sinaloa.
“You have to take over the task that is accompanied by the journalist’s agency, the second option is to play a fool.
I don’t want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t say what was happening.”
Riodoce's colleague is a fan of Valdez, a funny man who crashed like a man, a friend who shared embuces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They rely on his routine.
He's always carrying his cube.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar and sat at the same table.
Now they are asking if his routine love has become destitute of him.
His death has also caused them to doubt how to do the best of their work and keep them alive.
"They don't like if they are kidnapped with their women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing places used for the transport of drugs."
"These things shouldn't be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is even at the best times a strong self-esteem and self-care.
Trusting your instincts.
If the thing smells suspicious, keep it away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, there is a problem in the fact that "the dinner can be fraudulent... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that Sinaloa no longer applies to old rules, just as they do not applies in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros, or in other states that are home to the toxic association of profitable trafficking routes, weak institutions and corrupted officials.
The motorcycle is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff gathered for security training, mobile phones were no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only the software sold to governments was used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Two police officers in front of the house were looking for a 40-degree heat relief in the shadow of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered whether these police officers belonged to the 50 percent of police officers whose governor himself had been deprived of unreliable temples.
How many months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous lands where de facto control is in the hands of narcotics.
This week’s Riodoce issue discussed three basic stories.
One of them was the murder of the former poxilog Julio Cesar Chavezi's brother in Sinalo.
They also had a clear story about the government’s spending money on the hometown of the Gubernator.
And a group of people were stolen from the prosecutor's office, a quarter away from Culiacan, one of the most expensive restaurants.
There was no official notice of who was stolen or how it happened, so it was necessary to be cautious when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows about the restaurant is a place of mind for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belonged to the powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics over almost the entire century.
Recently, several IRP cuberners have been accused of corruption in cases of widespread reflection.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzmani, El Chapo, was called to escape the military.
Every few months ago, readers would have searched for a Valdez column to get information on the human race from the best sources.
"We would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, a 46-year-old whose body building has served as El Flaco.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez’s office has received a deposit for tags and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the employees of the distribution have received something they could never expect on behalf of the press activists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez hit a couple of times and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another reporter.
Salvador Adam disappeared three days after the murder of Valdez in the west state of Michoacan.
The body has been found burned, and officials say it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become a voice voice throughout the country, criticizing the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest for walks and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez will leave in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
On the day after the death of Valdez, in meeting with the cubier Sinalo, Ramirez was accused of reporters of the authority in destruction and murder of the truth.
After that, he asked him to turn from revealing the government’s activities to another, worrying that anger had influenced his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "restricted to organized crimes, co-procured officials and any society."
In his last book "Narcotics Journalism" he wrote that reporters were not only murdered by narcotics, but also done by the command of politicians and security forces who were organized with crime.
The media channel supervisory group Article 19 last year held more than half of the attacks of journalists on police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you are dying because you want to be quiet," Ramirez said.
Some of them obviously have a fluctuation effect.
No one has forgotten the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Maciase in the north-eastern piracy in Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter to which he had probably signed down on the Los Zetas card: "I'm here for my reports."
Along with his head, computer keyboards and headphones were covered.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as newspaper El Norte in the northern region of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breachi in March.
Others move forward, as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their president in 2004.
In 2010, the journal Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have suffered from home countries or even from the country.
It's a nervous decision.
Exile is hard to find work and they still have to keep the streets to avoid the risks.
And sometimes, as it happened with photographer Ruben Espinosaga, who was murdered with four female females in a Mexico apartment in 2015 for three months after a kidnapping from Veracruz.
Those who stay in the place and continue to work must dance risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a poet, admits that revealing a drug threatens her.
"Mexico is on the way to hell, and that's why I'm a reporter," he said.
On the middle of the last night, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce editors sat in front of the office on the walkway and screwed beer when all the phones suddenly began to vibrate.
In the coastal district of Mazatlan, 19 people were killed in fire exchanges between rival forces and security forces.
The war continues in the escalera, as promised by several cartels found in the region.
From there, reporters put news on the Riodoce website using their mobile phone.
The next day, there was a need to change.
The Sirenes went through another fire exchange in the region.
Bojourquez's boat to the police officers in custody to see if they're guarded.
When they were scared, they didn’t show it at least.
Under a massive portrait of the founder of the magazine, with his middle finger to see the whole Sinalo, Riodoce’s staff were edited by his followers.
"How could I think about closing," Bojorquez said, "if on the same day Javier was killed, a practitioner asked me to send him to the street reporters?"
Dinosaurs used protective colors to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shape, although it's pretty scary.
Scientists have now disclosed the first findings regarding the livelihood of the unbelievable nose size, which has so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
This phrase has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with her skins was red-brown and her past had been somewhat "small".
The journal Current Biology describes its presence as “the best preserved thermal disosurer ever found” and as “one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
For fossils, it is a new nodosaurus species that lived in the middle of the crisis period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good conservation has been defeated by the scholars who describe it as "really significant".
According to the journal National Geographic, this heat-coated plant plant has best preserved this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 when he dropped Suncor Millennium in Fort McMurray near North Alberta in Canada.
He struck something that didn’t remind the surrounding stone, and decided to explore closer.
The discovery of the fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
In the next six years, the animal was designed to remove the land from the 2500-five (1100 kilos).
After all this difficulty, the end result is now ready to prepare the public.
"When a little bit of eyes are tears, you can almost believe he's asleep," chief author Caleb Brown, a reporter at the Royal Tyrrelli museum, said.
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
In his skin research, the researchers found that this plant dish, which is well-covered with heats and remembers walking tanks, probably threatened significantly meat-made dinosaurs.
This high-hearted dinosaur used red and white protective colors to hide from clays, and implemented asylum techniques called resistance, which are also used by many today’s animals.
According to experts, it allowed the dinosaurs to climb better around and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110-million-year-old residence belonging to the family of nodosalers reached the news for the first time and is now visited by the Royal Tyrrell Palace Museum.
The researchers have investigated the presence and given it the name of Borealopelta Markmitchelli Museum, according to Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover animals.
Thanks to the incredibly good preservation of the self, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the heat on the body.
They discovered resistance - a method of protection spreading in the animal, which means that the bottom side of the being was darker than the bottom.
Although resistance has spread, the inventions come as a surprise, since Borealope is significantly larger than the animals living with resistance today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunting actively enough by other dinosaurs from muscle feeders to predominant evolution as a survival act instead of an anti-invasion.
But most of the animals that use modern resistance – such as horrors, sebras or armadiles – are much smaller and more vulnerable, indicating that nodosaurus had to look really hard to survive.
"The powerful hunting of a extremely large and widespread dinosaur that is covered with hotspots indicates how dangerous thefts could be from the critical dinosaurs," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of these organic compounds also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal to get tips on the life of it, including the content of its intestine retained, to find out what the animal was going on for their last time.
They believe that the dinosaur fell over the rivers, thus reaching the stream to the sea, where the back of the ocean was in front of him.
At that time, Alberta was the same warm as today in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely much farther than today.
“This nodosaurus is truly significant because it is fully covered with sexual skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
As a result, the animal looks almost the same as in the crisis.
To reconstruct it, there is no need to use a lot of imagination - it just sucks the eyes and it feels like it's asleep."
A critical era was the time when the Earth swimled huge two fats moving from the meat dishes - the theropods.
Although all of their King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealope, some of his terrifying predecessors could be hunted from this heated dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of weight in a monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealope was released after the death of the sea and that the mumphiceaerus was in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk was discovered in the Millennium mining district of Fort McMurray near North Alberta in Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved warmth in the world, including the skin and the Finnish, and it is from the whole to the wooden baths.
These stays were an average of 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
There were two 20 inches of height from the holes.
Scientists believe that this vegetable meal, covered with heats, is adventured through the current Western Canada, until the floods over the river have been admired by this open sea.
However, the dinosaur’s submarine landscape helped to preserve its islands in detail.
The remains of this particular self have been so well preserved that toxic heat plates along the dinosaur heads still cover skin depressions.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: “This level of conservation is as rare as lottery.
The more I see, the incredibly it seems.
Stoneed skin decays still cover the animal's swelling hot plates.
The right front lies next to him, and five of the wings are scratched upwards.
I can count on the hotspots on his side."
How did one of the activists find the answer to the question "Who are the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell became a full shock.
Every day after travelling to New York, the St. Louis resident sat in a bed rented through Airbnb, browsing on Facebook.
He was on his former schoolmate's post.
There was a letter: "The police just killed a 18-year-old and he's sleeping in the street so far."
He was confused why nobody else had posted this information on his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoah user's posts were repeatedly shared during his timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's area was sent to real time by Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
She posted a picture of Brown's survival of the body that fell in the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought of herself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone off, but later in the evening, I saw a new show that told people to meet at Canfield Drive this time.
She shared pictures of a policeman and shouting people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and still kept the letter, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream where a police officer was standing in front of a group of protesters.
In the second video, one other police officer shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he touched himself in a sense: "It's unusual."
“This is not a murder that we have used to and that we could call it typical.”
I feel scary at the moment.
I was angry and wept.”
She booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
At 23, he went to his father's six-year-old daughter and decided to ride two Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary film "Whose Streets?" (“Who Streets?”), which will be featured in cinemas on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and endurance of those people who live in this community and who fulfill the answers in the calling of the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who had a flower dress in the back and headed a suitable crown - were driving to Ferguson, they talked again about the topic that had come from them repeatedly earlier this morning - from the experiences and conditions of blackness.
“Do you remember when I taught you how the black community should fight for your rights?” she asked.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What's happening is... the culmination of the past.
He must know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He has to learn about activism and organization and, at the same time, know the different experiences and conditions of blackness and what we have to do to get free and free.
Even if I manage to raise her in such a way that she does not experience personally celebrated racism, she does not differ from any other black daughter.
I feel that I would make him a ruin if I would protect him from this world.”
The first stop they made when Ferguson arrived was on the South Florissant road - a place on the road from the police department, which had been on a certain level of land where activists expected news about the police officer Darren Wilson, who had not finally been charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined the forces with the local business owner who made the suburbs.
They put the food houses together and helped them share with the protesters.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism began to form slowly.
"My activism has changed entirely after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, he was the President of the Union of Students of the Minority and focused on food fairness and health in black people's communities.
“I had no organizational experience.
It's all just a shade."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film’s co-director Sabaah Folayan during the evening’s delight.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrelli's question was simple: "Do you try to document or find a story that can be used?"
This skepticism was caused by an infinite number of cases where people - often white people - come to a community and try to cut off its strength and sustainability.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We have heard that the voice of people born and grown up in Ferguson is not accepted and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with co-register Damon Davis, an artist in the region, who was known for activism in connection with deceased prisoners.
His involvement transformed the project into conjunction with Ferrella and six other locals whose film "Whose Streets?" team watched for years after Brown's shooting.
"No one speaks for us or for us in this documentary," Davis said.
“It was important for me to imagine these people, because that’s how they imagine me.”
Although the purpose was not to focus on Ferrella's experience - it was to show that the movement was not "a leader but a community meeting", as Folayan said, it was the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrella's life, such as mercy and marriage to his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing over the first time she saw the lane ready.
"But I realized that this work and the humanization of black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerabilities."
Further, Ferrelli's story emphasizes and puts back in the middle of the role of a black gay woman in the broader Black Lives Matteri movement.
Two of the three initiators who thought on social media in 2012 after the killing of a black teen Trayvon Martin themes #BlackLivesMatter, are gay.
"In the leading role of black-sex homosexual women have kept the movement over-the-counter," Ferrell said, "and that's just because we have to constantly fight on several lines.
Black gay women must carry all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "Movement is actually alive by black women and many of them are black gay women."
He also argues that "the action is not a matter of creating a kind of equal opportunity" - Ferrelli was not chosen to be the center of the film due to his identity.
"He was the man with the right energy," he said.
"But this is not an accident that he was placed directly on the chestline, because in such a spot, a lot of weight has been given to a black-sex homosexual woman.
Its energy can be seen through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial connections between the community and the police remain intact.
The penalty for the lockdown of the road to Ferrell will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy in the airspace region that he calls home, simply "invasive poverty".
However, he still considers an important mantra that he has dipped in memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our neighbors.”
7 Tips How to Get Over After the Weekend Party
Some of the worst men will find a party after a pop-up, no matter what a problem, it will help.
Or they say, "Wait from the bottom, stay in the pit."
But this is just an inevitable delay and a good cause for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after and after the weekend - or another party - and to overcome painlessly as possible?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Under and above alcohol, after a big party in the morning... or even, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses alcohol by consuming a lot of liquid, it must be returned at some point.
With water, minerals are also removed from the body, and the seafood is good to drink mineral water.
As the stomach is frequently irritated after pressing, it is particularly good if it is folly-free or just slightly gased.
Go walk.
Surely it wouldn't be necessary to push trees to grandmother with the base - this may prove to be a fateful decision.
But a light walk helps the body remember what it feels to be alive.
Teaching the tent and getting out of the pot is a more time-required way to recover.
Give your body energy back smoothly and carefully.
If you’re getting out of overweight yesterday, it’s not worth trying to load a lot of fat grain.
Start, for example, with fresh juice containing fruit sugars that are silently marketed by your body.
If you already suffer from the health of the south, you can try a puljong, for example.
And a little later the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the last water.
As already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on pain fans.
If you are taking a boom to prevent pain in the evening, your liver needs to deal with alcohol as well as paracetamol or ibuprofen and thus lose performance.
So your liver is even worse and then it's worse.
In addition, it does not stay painful as long as it is in the body.
If you take a painful medication in the morning, do not do it with a full empty stomach - it will irritate you with your dirty smell.
If you don’t have a partner, you can do well with yourself.
It affects about the same way as walking, but when walking does not get orgasm.
However, avoid too active pace and rotating shops - during the basics, physical effort should be moderate.
Make a joke.
Talk with friends-candidates, make simple tobeds and laugh friendly about yourself and others (candidates).
Laughter and laughter may not be ashamed, but with the help of them are more fun to endure.
Once upon a time, the boom goes over to this.
Professor Northwester and Oxford University employees are searched for suspected murder
According to the police, a nationally searched professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who had been suspected of finding one of Chicago’s luxury cards on the death of a deadly human being.
According to Cook’s county court documents, on Monday, without the possibility of detention, Wyndham Lathem and the 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested for their alleged connection to Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau death.
A 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after a repeat pocket.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the dead body was discovered on July 27.
Police got a phone call and found a victim to the Grand Plaza apartment when they arrived, whose body had a number of torch wounded.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was recognized as a kidnapping at the site of the incident, while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as a co-professor at the University of Northwestern Microbiology and Immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University of Public Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now temporarily removed from work and it is forbidden to enter Northwestern University’s town halls.
"It is now a criminal case investigating by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern cooperates with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is an elderly assistant at the University of Oxford financial department.
The representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in connection with the UK police and are ready to assist the US investigative authorities in any possible way."
In addition, the letter stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wished to give her off.
Chief of the Chicago Police Department of Communications, Anthony Guglielmi, recommends to the suspicious to submit powers.
“The police have an idea where they are, but we are dealing with the definition of the exact location increasingly intensely,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, suspects will help search local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said the police received a telephone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received the encryption point that something happened in apartment No. 1008.
According to the police's description, it was possible to have a view.
Guglielma said it was unclear whether the event took place on July 27.
He said the security cameras were confirming Lathem and Warren staying in the building.
"I think Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Headquarters sent a letter to the residents: “The police are currently working to clarify the background of the events chronology and the victim and explore various reasons, including the possibility that it was a family week.”
Ivory companies that help your company avoid getting the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her leading e-commerce firm, but the surveys were unrivalled.
The answers were often uncommon, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“This system was simply not consistent and objective,” said Errett, who is headed by the e-commerce company Madison Reed, who operates 75 employees in San Francisco.
He called for help from outsiders.
There is a new type of human resource-related companies that help businesses find out what their employees feel.
Developing and licensed software aimed at measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to make sudden questions, take side-by-side certain men's and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaints with hot line and, in some cases, allow drivers and linguists to go
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-operator and CEO of Redwood City's leading company Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Erretti, in three years when he used Glinti, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys aimed at certain teams, it offers a company’s heat card, providing an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to explain the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they have to remain familiar with their labour culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been messed up in scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described a devastating environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For former companies such as Glint, the desire for ownership is a business opportunity.
The global management, regulation and compliance area may, according to the Financial Statistics website of Let's Talk Payments data, be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The leading company in Denver Colorados, Convercent, which helps companies prevent and identify inappropriate behaviors, observed this year Uber’s suspicious reputation in the background of interest and activity.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send tailored impulse questions, collect confidential answers in real time and look at hot card problems.
It also offers an anonymous message line that allows employees to know about inadequate behavior.
And when it comes to the case, the complaints go directly to the Board of Directors.
"The public opinion has been encouraged by regulatory authorities," Convercent's founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan said.
In Quinlan’s words, if the company is found to be treated badly or misconducted by its employees, the company can face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, departure of employees and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not interfere.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide easy ways to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the corporate headquarters phone number or email address, file an official complaint and hope that it is taken seriously.
This was often a distracting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday, General Advisor James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercenti, however, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, attraction or unfair wage practices that have not previously reached leaders who have acted in other cities or states.
"I can get closer to the 360-degree worker experience," Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday risk management group, said.
"And we protect our shareholders from disputes with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking more seriously ethical behaviour, values, and employee involvement, in 2002, or after the fall of the auditor firm Arthur Andersen due to ethical violations related to the Enron scandal.
However, only when "social media became mature," companies realized that they could not prevent their black washing publicly from washing online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and a possibility that has been approved by risk capital investors, which have been supportive for both businesses.
Convercenti funded $10 million in February for companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, rising to $47 million in the value of capital collected.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments shall not be a surprise when taking into account the relationship between enterprises, culture and risk capital.
More and more studies show that today’s employees are expecting more work than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, there are high wages and interesting projects only on board.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are listening and that the work they are doing is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the company's success," Nina McQueen, who is a general benefit and experienced Vice-President of the Department on LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glinti.
Investors earn revenue when companies belonging to their portfolio go well; companies go well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools allow to increase employee commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that these support will be found.
The ownership of data on the involvement of employees is important, according to experts in the culture.
However, these data are used if the company’s followers do not start with them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations for changes to be expected.
And if changes do not occur quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"When you ask about 4,000 proposals, you must be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Kotter International Advisory and Business Management, President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make mistakes in supporting too much data collection.
“When things don’t end, the employees think, ‘Have you actually heard me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care about it?"
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, who is now conducting studies once a month among employees, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glinti.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed employees in the speed of making decisions and in the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to address problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays is collected new data on employees and is expected to bring with it a long-term industry of long-term commitment to employees, which is known for its great workforce flow.
“If you haven’t committed to ensuring transparency, you’re losing people,” Vitrano said.
“If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose your customers, you lose your business.”
The euro area’s radiant star is the Baltic: revenue is growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic region, three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the revenue of Western-European rich countries, Bloomberg reports.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, overall economic production per person has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Success is behind low debt burden, rapidly improved institutions and business-free policy.
"Balti countries in one Slovakia are among small euro area countries where real GDP per person has been significantly closer to the EU's average," the Central Bank said.
Although the aim is to increase the equality of global economic production for human beings with Western Europe, in 2015 Baltic economic production for human beings constituted only 2/3 of the average 15 countries belonging to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led Baltic to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light and the economy is also growing in the streets, local residents are not even enthusiastic.
According to a recent Eurobarometer study, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents assessed that their economies were going very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was a little less than half of the questioned economies of their countries.
NCAA’s decision to cancel exercises that take place twice a day makes Bruins days long
It is almost 23 hours when the UCLA football team stops to talk to the team at the edge of the new field of exercise located in the university.
Some of them have craved from the back of the straw, revealing their workplace after the first day of the workplace's hygiene effort.
For a large part of the team, these arrival minutes offer midday pause.
In the summer, players who attend the courses will go back to the final exams after three hours of training before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"Three days are a real trial for them," Bruin's coach Jim Mora said a little before it became Monday.
The NCAA decision to cancel the exercises that take place twice a day has actually changed their days - at least until the end of the tests to reach one-half.
For this reason, the UCLA’s first three trainings were scheduled to start at 19.15 to adapt to the tight schedule for players.
Transition from two trainings per day means more than one training day - the beginning of the Bruinsi training camp was increased by almost week's pre-season division and for the first time during the six-season of Mora Westwood during summer courses.
They have 18 training plans up to August 20 before the official preparation begins to open the game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora says that he is in favour of the NCAA regulation, although it adds another agenda point to the dense graphs of players.
"They have a huge burden for three or four days and this is a serious challenge," Mora said.
“And they are worried about this trial; they are excited, they are beautiful young people.
I believe that if Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.”
Once the camp is finished, UCLA will turn the exercises closed, which is not a simple task, taking into account the clear view of their challenges from the nearby parking space and the nearby center of Luskini, a higher-class hotel, which has already been overlooked by the gateways around the defence network.
Since this weekend, Bruinsi players have been busy with the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems can occur with free rooms during the season.
"We're taking security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s not even overwhelming to think that people can rent a room and film out of there.
If you have a recording training, you can do a really good deal with it.
But we're using security teams there and on the 8th parking lot.
We make the best use of the existing ones.
I'm not really worried about it.
We have a plan in place."
The Savisaare-Ivanova Election Union, the Christianina Ojuland, exited from the Reform Region, and the EKRE, forcing Maria Kaljuste to join the forces of our Tallinn and the party members to show at least the hopeful local electorate in Tagus Tallinn - appears to be part of the same election as a party policy.
But the tibes are considered in the autumn, and the key question is whether they will be disappointed enough for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisare?
If the support group of Edgar Savisa is a minor, it may only be organized for the honour of his election union.
One member of the state council, some of the former and current Central Communities and many unknown faces - can such a one be in the composition of the election union?
And is there any reason why some of the loyalty holders and friends of the Savisas are absent from the nomination in Tallinn, that the "list of the Savisas" of the Japanese whose predecessors are suspected of corruption and corruption crimes have become reality?
Filmed music video on the roof of the city government for the Russian-language population, involving the elderly of the city of Lasnamäe; and in every way the original computer game, in which the main character of the Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid lockers and robbers falling on the road when driving the wheel - is this way the Central Committee attempting to vote for the first 17 votes or 16 votes?
Let's wait for what other parties are planning for a youth-specific election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers look at a black square instead of entertainment from the beginning of August, there are two options: agree that there will be only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels in the next month, or transfer to some TV operators every ten months.
There are probably also those who initially enjoy publicly over advertising-free television experience, but ultimately – whatever contrary – pay for television and advertisements.
The noise of the music, the noise of the people and the streets left is the head of every major music festival of unpleasant side effects.
If you don’t want to get a part of the noise yourself, however, instead of getting a headquarters at home, it’s worth discovering the home country to go - and leave the place to sleep for the amount of the lungs for the festival visits.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
The media is quoted by President Donald Trump, who says a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the green card rules.
The plan provides a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary work visa and restrictions on family-oriented visa.
The new rules have been offered by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill will be discussed in two Houses of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money, as it changes the way to issue green cards to U.S. citizens of other countries.
The law reduces immigration and begins to replace the current programme.
The new application process gives advantages to candidates who speak English and who have financial resources to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement in a US media statement.
The Siberian seat young people move back to the city, retirees back to the country.
The Anatole of Yevsejevi continues the tradition of the famous sets of golden vessels of the ancient Maana River.
It works 140 km from the home on the golden ride of the Maana River on the edge of the Kuwai River.
It’s hard work: two months on a daily basis without 12 hours of rest and then only ten days at home and again.
Within three years in Artell, Anatolia has only seen gold once.
“There’s a hard time: the entrance is thoroughly checked so that the wine does not take, and out so that the gold does not take,” Anatoli says.
Mare Piho in Haida village with a local seat Jaani, who has told him a lot about his family’s memories in Siberia.
The still preserved archaeological culture of Siberian sets will also begin to influence the home sets, as it is simply as amazing, thinks the most thoroughly remote sets explored Piho Mare.
His first research trip to Siberia lasts 30 years in the street.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many people still emigrated to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'm saying, 8000.
I thought about it according to the talks of the Siberian seat of men who have also thought about it.
It’s hard to say, because the ball could come in a group of up to 30 people, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was given to only one, but with him were children, sisters, etc.
See how big this area was here!
It was several times larger than the historic Setoma.
It was necessary to practice it, to manage it in a way.
Sets came here as farmers, but their lives changed, because they occurred here in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to rivers (payment), golden buildings, industry.
For example, many sets later went to work in the secret city of Krasnojarsk-45 (the Soviet power built a uranium building - J. P.), when it was formed.
Did the seeds make up the majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, a long tradition has been maintained to marry each other and to multiply childhood.
Seven-eight children in the family were ordinary.
How much is the culture of Siberian setoes different from the mother setoes?
They are different, although what was brought here was ever the same.
They brought a lot of people.
So they did themselves, but they always did the difference between what was brought together and what was done here.
Climate change has greatly influenced the traditional clothing of cetos, because here it is colder.
Foods changed.
For example, in Setonia the meat was salted, but here it was just cooled.
Where are the villages of the Siberian setos and what lives do they live there? / Graphics: Alari Paluots
The side with the mother was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
I think it's now going to get Setuma back there, it's going to affect them.
These girls who have lived here in families have heard amazing stories.
Piho must take into account the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came early July to the Day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived four days in homes - J. P.
What's left here is awesome.
"Tapale is a great way to come and go, because the city has a great place to stay: at the railway station and at the road crossing point," says Reigo Tamm, an operar from Tapat.
The city has not long been just a military base, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture, and the pitch can be in every corner.
It's a top-top town!
A small island is located along the White River that runs through the city, where the tailors usually hold a janifield.
"This beautiful thing doesn't get out of the train window," Reigo says.
Whoever does not fear the cold waters can be drunk, for the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
A quarter can hold the picnic and just make romantic - can face the flow of the river and think of life in front and behind.
I also walked there with my bridesmaids.
The operary Tamm has been practicing between three bridges between its Aariaids: "Whether this place is near the city, maybe no one will be opposed to come unless his own stories come together."
“A wonderful view of Tapa opens from the host’s memory, but there are also healthcare professionals where you can run, winter, and now, for example, play disc golf – golf courses are made, chains can be borrowed from the sports center,” Reigo says.
Of course, old professionals are going there, but I haven't been there yet to play.
Probably a colleague Rasmus Kull should be invited to Tapa, because he has an experienced disc golfer and he has a set.
He borrowed me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were almost undivided from the childhood of the operar.
At least at the time of the mouth.
There's a lot of rabbits on this mountain, disappointment, and you'll be able to play in my sport.
I'm not talking about broken shirts and mouths.
"The whole city is now full of construction work, it all turns into unknown," Reigo says.
The old and tired vassal building, however, is a very attractive place where summer responses are played.
I’m glad that in 2012, R.A.A.A.Mi’s director Märt Meos took my idea and went to his theatre to make a vassal summer theatre.
Although the street theatre season "Aleksei Karenini" was just over, August 11 has a "Source" railway station when the old vassal building is moved around the 1980s.
“To August 11-13, Tapa is the days of the city, which have been awakened by open house cafes and are held in a series of cultural conferences, among other things, the public hall,” Reigo, who recommends visiting the city on that day from 91 years of age, said.
In a small yellow house on 1 May, the museum has been found since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibitions have a lot of information and great," says Reigo, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on rail and war.
Reigo remembers that when Tapat passes through all the recommended places, the stomach goes empty on a long scale, but fortunately the small town is full of coffee shops.
“We have so good dishes and sitting in coffee shops sometimes feels that you are abroad,” she describes.
The educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in the cafés, the sister sitting there has a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international company together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians are arrested for illegal training in Greece
Telekanal bTV cited the Foreign Ministry, which announced that two Bulgarians were detained for illegal detention in Greece.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally trained people on the peninsula of Sithonia, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation is now being done.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told TV bTV that the Bulgarians would later be released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free movement and are already imposing harsh taxes for all those who remain in a place of rest that is not intended for this purpose.
Controls continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may appoint a fee.
The dogs who teach the dogs are walking in the flocks.
After a year’s break, the farmers have to give their goats a "teaching material" from their cattle - apparently the dogs that have been taught by chickens have already been torn with a number of sheep.
In the street, dogs in the Hiiu district have wounded sheep three times, with 23 sheep in total and eight injured, says Hiiu Leht.
Mullu had the corresponding number only three years ago, 124.
The environmental agency also shows that the mullu Hiiumaal was not born and that the Hiiumaa Refrigerator Council information that this year two mullu was fixed on the island.
On Monday night, the dogs at Emmaste's village in Kabuna were wounded by 15 sheep and injured 18 surviving sheep.
On Wednesday morning, the dogs in the village of Rachel raped one sheep in the cattle and injured the other with severe injuries.
The rules for the treatment of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural has sent a draft law on the implementation of the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and a draft law on the modification of plant protection.
The amendment of the Act shall give rise to the creation of a separate data collection for both genetically modified (GM) crops and for operators, and shall then be used for this purpose.
In addition, the GM farming operator's obligation to have the prior agreement with the person engaged in radio showing is amended.
Although there are currently no genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider the existence of clear rules to coexist genetically modified and unchanged crops.
This will be at least a joke until the decision is made to declare the Estonian GMO free,” said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Affairs of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"It should be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and administrative burdens associated with the private and public sectors," said Suu.
The draft law repeales the provisions relating to the data collection and training of GM crops in GMOVS, the requirements for the treatment of GM crops and the initiation of economic activity.
With regard to the specific fertilization, the GM farmer shall be replaced by the current obligation to inform the GM farmer of the start of the GM farm with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the bees before the start of the breeding.
The draft law was sent to the ministries to coordinate.
All stakeholders have the opportunity to present this in the information system of proposals and, if they wish, to present their opinion to the Ministry of Rural.
The proposed amendments will affect, in particular, the persons working in the field of plantation, the plant plants and the Agriculture Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is permitted to grow only one GM crop - the MON 810 of corn.
However, none of the Estonian farmers have been interested in cultivating GM crops.
The reason is that there is no damage to corn in Estonia, a European reservoir for which MON 810 is resistant to corn.
Sorts of this maize are also grown in southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has ordered studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in various soaps, corn and soybean seeds grown in Estonia.
The analysis results of the samples showed that seeds did not contain alien seeds and, as a result of the study, it was concluded that seeds of rabbit, corn and soybean breeds grown in Estonia did not contain a genetically modified organism.
In the past, it can be concluded that in Estonia there is no consciously cultivation of genetically modified crops and that there is also confirmation that no accidental contamination has occurred.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United will serve Nemanja Maticu as "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has painted Nemanja Maticu's face "genius" after the midfielder made his debtor against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
For over £40 million, a player purchased from Chelsea began in the last season game in Dublin in United before the Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday, 2-1 win in the algery, publishing the ballots in a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to run on attacks.
However, while staying away from the Blues season before the Asian tournament, Maticul was urgently needed to match the form and held only 45 minutes. Mourinho says that it must be fixed before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he has experiences, intelligence, genial thinking - he has football pleasures," Mourinho said.
"We will help him get the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new ones, including Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, also began in the algravity stage at the Aviva stadium, and Mourinho began to quietly place the beginning of the season as its eleventh initial man.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to paint three football games, but he confirmed that the club has already made a "super-natural job" by concluding agreements with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realize three of four," he added.
“I’m even happier when they can do the work of four, but they’ve seen it hard for me.”
Another shock period was reached by the GSM recipient on August 1 and then Muhus.
According to Matthew Martinson, the bird observer in Sørves, the first mischief was equipped with a sender in Sørves, and this peasant is already flying around, leaving the desert and joining a large nightclub in Mullutu-Suurlah.
That's because it's not a fruitful fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruit
On Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the wings, the sender got another wings on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of senders is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Mullu was equipped with a Matthew GSM sender in Sõrves Türjul.
"They're all watching on the internet: how he walked in Spain in winter, a little time back at the German-Poland border and then came to Saarema," Martinson said.
The British inventor has glass installed a microchip on his body to get to the house and car with a handheld
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip in order to open his front with only a handheld, enter the office and even drive the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam has allowed to install a small bridge between his table and his name finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their life easier with technology.
He has combined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hantsi, to ensure that the installation procedure is compliant with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip that can be installed for cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure.
Northami also exchanges houses and car locks to match the kid, asking for a lock of 300 pounds.
This marriage of one child’s father has been installed technology for now both at home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand plays a role.
The White House Expo has sent taxpayers to pay thousands
According to military documents published in the TIME magazine, the White House decided to fly a marine helicopter last month to pay $24,000 for an event that marks U.S. production.
The green and white color of Sikorsky VH-3D, named Marine One, was the central number of the event of the American building programs in the White House on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House have renewed industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exposed together with a hunt from Maine, a firefighter car from Wisconsin and a coffee beam made in Mississippi.
According to the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) documents, the White House’s military cabinet required the presence of a helicopter with FARGO 36 hours before the helicopter was used for the "unusual" event on the south side of the land.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually important event," the HMX-1 commander said on the day before the event came, in an e-mail to his chief chief officer in the field of aviation.
The helicopter will arrive to the southern oven on July 17 morning at 7:00 p.m. for a tour and stay there until the oven is cleaned between 18:00 and 21:00.
It was added that if leaving the White House should be left, a second crew would need to fly back because of the time limits of work.
The original aircraft crew was near the helicopter during the event, and the escadron security crew stayed close to the aircraft throughout the time it was on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents issued to the TIME magazine whether or not the other crew was finally required or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents indicate that HMX-1 examined whether the event could violate this provision.
"We'll see if it violates Hatchi's law, and we'll be told that it won't be killed," the commander wrote.
"You don't think you have a choice," said the Chief Officer Deputy.
The White House declared the event "prepared in America" to be an official event and the Hatch law would not cover it.
Even at the official meetings there are political subtones.
The President supported the efforts of the health reform in the Senate at the time of the meeting and praised efforts to keep government regulations in line.
The use of an aircraft known under the name Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is no new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for pure photography is unusual.
Trump took note in February when his first campaign conference in Florida, Melbourne, had four presidents' backdrop planes, and his Twitter account was curious about how his predecessor’s president used the plane.
"Valgel House is very pleased with the release "Made in America" where products were represented from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers," said White House's compulsory representative Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 teams are often testing in Washington’s surroundings and in the south side to exercise a retreat to the White House with a centimeter precision.
When Trump took place at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 White House held 58 attempts.
According to the official, the flight to the tournament "American-made" flight crew was considered to be the standard for the course of this month.
Helicopters of the Escadron flew on that day in addition to 11 hours for "unrelated support missions" to the President.
According to the White House, no other exhibit of this event was loaded in the taxpayer’s cashbox.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of a helicopter exhibit on the south side.
HMX-1 does not retain the President's budget documents for flights and it is difficult to clarify the exact expenditure due to the event.
But according to the price of an hour of the 2017 financial year, VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight.
The charter documents indicated the length of the flight from the main base of the Quantico Marine from the airport from Virginia for 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is much lower than its amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible expenditure taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the remuneration rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, but cover the costs associated with fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House Press Representative Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the time.
"The idea of Asia is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut states are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, unless even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have seen uncomfortablely hard.
So, of course, it’s right to highlight it.”
It’s unclear whether Trump hit the south side of the crash during the event when he took a walk with a helicopter, but he sat behind the firefighter’s role.
Within the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky’s representatives, throwing the media outlets a joke about the company’s products in his personal air park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through Pirates arrived peace and joy
In 2011 at the MM Daegus, Shadeikot hit the last area, 800 metres of foot run, and was driven from the stadium with a carriage.
Soon before it was, he had received zero from a universe held in China at a distance.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was injured in an injury, but at the London debut Olympics he was ranked at 6013 point 23.
But the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of 2013, the MM of Moscow received an Estonian remote record in the Estonian chart.
Two years later, he won 15th place at the Beijing MM and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but even wanted to be more disappointed by the athlete.
The hardest cattle passed through Shadeiko only when it was unable to get a letter at the Amsterdam EM distances at the beginning.
I would just like to put together one or more matches.
“One time,” Sadeiko hurried.
It was even worse: a month later, his Olympics broke off because of the sweat in Rio.
It was time to take off – is it going to continue with the seventh?
Are two days of effort still worth it all?
They were thinking for a long time, but they found peace.
I got my head cleaned up.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I thought the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, it was time to heal yourself and think clean.
"I knew I didn't put the pill in my bag yet," said Shadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I got to turn a clean page and move a new highway.
Coach Anne Berg said he was very hard to see the sufferings of carefulness, but he realized that the athlete had to get into clarity.
He was so mad by everyone.
It was hard to tolerate.
"Greet said he didn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what it is worth," Mount said.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He's doing it for his own pleasure.
The match came back in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the multi-match of Götzise.
At a high level competition, he improved his personal top mark with about metres (13.89) and ran a record-near time barrier.
Then, the multiplayer knew that it wasn't even the fate of powers, but was deleted to become the only first race.
He has been guided by the mountains for years, saying that Shadeiko is a model student.
He's ready to be a athlete, he's good to train.
If something is wrong or wrong, he'll say it right away.
He feels his body and trusts his knowledge.
We have to leave that.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Shadeiko.
“I’m not the one who does the best in the training,” he says and says, “that the most important thing is to get the right knowledge, because it also provides a good result.
A nearby baby makes you happy
Good emotions have also offered luck to close friends.
His former coach Maris Mägi and sister Grete have recently become their parents, and a multi-rangeer has been supported by new airmen.
“It was interesting,” said Shadeiko.
A drinking alcohol that is equivalent to “treatment” of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is so big wine fan that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is Yale's neuroscientist.
His speech is not something about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather "very active" in the wine tasting process.
When we wear glass, turning wine into the mouth, enjoying it and after-taste, we put our brain in the work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wines don’t actually contain taste, but the taste emerges in the way the wine stimulates the brain.
It compares how the brain "sees" colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates wine taste," Sheperd says.
Things that affect the emergence of wine taste are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of swelling that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, says that the wine is not to be full of drinks.
“There must be more in action,” he says.
If you take too much locks, the system is overwhelmed.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory consumption, loss of balance and decreased mental capacity risk.
10% of Estonian ICT workers receive less salary from colleagues
Data from the company Fontes reveal that 10% of the Estonian ICT sector employees receive less salary from their colleagues.
Ten percent of the wages between men and women are, the portal Genius writes.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT industry research.
In total, there were under 8,577 offices.
63% of the offices were men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the wage difference is in the benefit of men and that the wage difference in other companies does not exist, in reality, the basic wage between men in the month is on average 10% higher than women in the month and the total wage for men in the year is on average 8% higher than women in the month."
"Narcose" 3rd season ad clip: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, he will be heading down to the Cali kartell in the Netflix hit series
Despite the fact that "Narcose" was revealed by Pablo Escobar's murderer in the second season, Netflix's sarre was not far ended.

According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The UN mission leader said on Wednesday that elections can be represented by the people only if all members of society, including women, play their role.
U.N. Assistance Chief Nicholas Haysom said hundreds of women are nominated for local Soviet elections, three women are nominated for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"It is impossible to overlook the importance of women's role," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be trusted only when women are fully involved in the election process and are involved in all stages.
The elections and presidential elections of the local Soviets of Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has, on its own, threatened the electoral process, which is in line with the transitional period, when the role of international military operations becomes acceptable.
The elections of this year celebrate for the first time that power will be transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women is to increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million women have registered from 3.6 million voters.

Traveling from the Philippines to the hearts of the movable fans of the world
The pockets of the flowers are a summer classic, which has been made of its own flowers in the last few years, which one of the right flowers of the flowers must turn their hand in the direction of the flowers, and which the traders have received despite their modesty of origin, to be invited to a price-compliant for the flower.
The red bag of the branches is probably one of the things that have existed at every time in life and whose possession has not caused special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not there, there's nothing breaking.
Now, however, the rugs are a real triumph, and the rugs have exchanged their fine design rugs for summer months instead of simple rugs against rugs.
This is not just a beach box, but today it is also popular as a street box, and more courageous women even walk into the office.
Here, however, it is worthwhile to clarify whether such a summer look at the top is still sitting or worthwhile to throw in a slightly more official sumadane.
Interviews have made women's real summer love.
For example, when reading foreign moblogs, it remains the first thing to look at the fact that the fashionable lands in vacation bring to the local market as the first thing to buy some of them, which will be loyal to the rest of the holiday season and which will be accompanied by the beach, the market, and also with friends in the city.
Some bloggers are so proud that they buy larger bags from the market and sell them or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags is so high among readers that in the real world, women (and men!) are likely to have hands on each other in order to get some bags a happy owner.
In some sense, such crazyness is also understandable, because these are rare times when it is possible in the world to buy something for just a few euro for a hitis status.
True, the traders have also discovered a simple cash service opportunity here, so the smaller luxury brands sell oils for some time and thousands of euros.
Probably for the sake that richer customers should not feel as simple as who walks around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros for yourself.
However, for Chanel’s interpretation, it could be $6000 in a circle.
Unlike the majority of the fashion designers, the designers do not come from some great fashions, but their story became the beginning rather farther.
I.e., they are allegedly from far from the Philippines, where they are widely transported.
The redness of the corners is there especially the exporter and the locals are very often not seen in the circle with them.
It is allegedly derived from the 14th century and is quite a pillar of ordinary replacement.
However, as the coat does not need to shake as strongly as the ear, it can fit into them patterns and other materials that make the house more personal and even more attractive.
For example, in recent times there are particularly trendy bags where red-colored panties or leather bags have been inserted.
Thanksgiving can be sent especially to actress Jane Birkin, whose greatest red cockpit had never been seen before.
I mean, he adapted to all possible clothing complexes and didn't even think much about it to go to Cannes' film festival.
In the popularity of homes today, however, there is no smaller role in the fact that caring for them is a cucumber and that, unlike any other Sumadans, they do not need to take care of them with special means, but the thing will also get rid of water and moisture.
As with trending exercises, brands that have emerged in addition to the classic look have all possible interpretations.
For example, if you want, you can buy a red riding or instead a turkey beverage.
However, it is worth noting that the classic sweater never goes out of fashion, but without sweater.
But what is the classic sweater?
For centuries it has been deemed a classic of such ankles, which reminds you of its stylish curtain, open to it and has short curtains, as well as ankles, candles.

GMB is worried about investments in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The company expects the confirmation of long-term production plans from McVitie's leaders at the company's Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silenced the topic of investment in the Tollcrossi object on the future.
In the manufacture of Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, more than 500 people work.
McVitie’s owner Pladis said they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
The employees and the chairmen of the trade union were hired there "the first to hear" if something changes in the factory activity.
In a letter sent to the company’s head, GMB Scotland asked McVitie to "rejoice concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernize production lines".
GMB parental organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we are unable to clarify from the head of the object about Tollcros’ business needs and future investment plans makes our members deeply worried.
It has worked here for a number of generations of families, and the labour forces are largely composed of a local community and the people of Glasgow, while it is essential to ensure proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social waste.
Therefore, Glasgow needs a firm with a rapidly growing production at McVitie in the eastern part of work, salary and well-being, as well as Brexit, the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production."
The representative of the Plate said: "The Customs Officer only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company responds directly to it because we appreciate the active communication with employees and representatives of the company.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and representatives of the GMB took place in Tollcrossis, which openly discussed several issues.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we will continue to look at our activities - and this applies to all of our enterprises and objects - to ensure their competitiveness.
"In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross object, most of which have gone into production lines and improved operations.
We fully consider Tollcrossi as the legacy of a production object and if any changes should be made in the activity of the object, employees and representatives of the company are the first to listen to it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of approaching Neymar?
La Liga can regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not allow Neymar to be attracted to his row by making a 189 million pounds offer for his purchase. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago from this record defeat?
This rude approach has been opened as a summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to clear more than twice the current world record, which was set up in the previous season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million.
When the transition is completed, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and also the most paid professional athlete in the world who will get more than 500,000 pounds a week after paying from PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry with both the way it approaches and Neymar is freed, although a source closer to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of football since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did PSG's president warn the world of football about this possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City in 2014 showed interest in the conclusion of a deal with Blaise Matui, Nasser Al-Khelaif hardly warned all the clubs who think about some of the best PSG players.
"I don't worry because they know that if they touch some of our players, we will receive them and contact them," Al-Khelaif said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to conclude a deal with some of our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed the border as the Spanish club showed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow Italians to leave under any condition and that Barcelona could get a relapse as a result of this interest, losing in the form of Neymar one of its expensive assets.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build a bridge, not a border after Brexit.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike the rock between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects have made it possible for the free movement of current people and goods, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: building a bridge, not borders,” he said.
According to the Vice-President, it would prefer to remain part of the UK in the European Union, and since it is not allowed, it would be part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the departure of the UK smoother would be to establish a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, Irish Prime Minister said.
Noteing that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “We could have such an agreement with the UK.”
It would be an alternative to returning to customs points that would declare the historical breakdown and political collapse.
"Speak to trade, peace and peace," said the Prime Minister.
He called the Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister visited Belfast with leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
Mars Avandi: Ironman, who has passed through its first half-long triatlon, can pass through everyone.
Today, at Otepää, the largest triathlon festival in Baltics was held, when a half-long Ironman competition was held by about a thousand triathlons from more than thirteen countries.
The 70.3 miles long distance consists of 1.9 km swimming, 90 km of the wheelchair and 21.1 km of the wheelchair.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life was Marte Avandi.
"I thought it would be complicated and it was finally complicated," he said.
In spite of the complexity of Avandi, it is actually a triathlon-rich head for everyone.
"Don't kill at a distance, but the time will kill," he said, suggesting that at a proper pace everyone reaches the end of the head.
Except for Ott Sepp: "It's all right with the physics, but she can't swim."
Agar had been trained in February.
Starting 4-5 hours a week, but 10 hours a week later.
At 05:34:12, he reached 270th place in general accounting.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "clase of celebrities" matches.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times respectively 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
Ironman's series was crowned as the general winner of men's accounting at the time of Johannes Molda 3:58:27, the Estonian was the best of Ivo the Great at 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danish Helle Frederiks won at 04:24:01, while the Estonian Maria Jänese, who lost Frederiks for about a half an hour, was held at 04:58:58.
The flight is 1,9 km long swimming distance 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410th position.
