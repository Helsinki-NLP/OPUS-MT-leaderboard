At the end of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange basked in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange retimed its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reach almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed its fall in the evening, when it lost nearly six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of shares in Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the U.S. financial sector stabilization plan, is also noticeable with us.
Fall of actions in Asia
The Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic decline on Tuesday, although the indexes succeeded in deleting some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent during the exchanges, but later it removed part of the losses and reduced the drop by nearly 2.5 percent.
Hang Seng China Enterprises index after the Chinese stock movement of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, while the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stocks of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but ultimately they managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6%.
"The hesitation on the rescue action in the United States will affect financial markets worldwide," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates are the same as in Hong Kong as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should soon resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it would be possible for other countries to suffer from these consequences.
The Blood Bath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it had to pay up to $700 billion (about 12 billion CZK).
The legislators rejected the call to support President George Bush’s draft.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. actions experienced a blood bath on Monday and the main stock indexes experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall in such a fall for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Ceda: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The heads of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush government agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
He will be submitted to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a $700 billion financial aid (about 12 billion crowns), granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not sure.
In fact, before being able to publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Reuters Barney Frank, chairman of the House’s Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee, said on Sunday.
According to sources, as soon as Wednesday, the plan should be prior to vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a primary psychological factor in degrading the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, a "delusion" will be followed.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our divergence opinions about the form that the package of measures to stabilize the market should have," said Nancy Pelosi, a democrat.
The final vote could be held by Sunday.
On Saturday to Sunday night, representatives of lawmakers met U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should, from financial companies, buy unselling real estate assets that lead to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and which must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Exchanges
The global financial crisis has significant impacts on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid does not escape, legislators make it possible that Congress brings a final agreement on Sunday.
They wish to calm investors before the start of trades on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress decision could affect Monday’s trades.
For the moment, it is impossible to clarify with certainty when the two Houses of the U.S. Congress will take the vote, or if the negotiations will not be blocked at the last time, by such or such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still have many changes.
The total amount intended for the use of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
But if the Congress feels that the programme does not perform its function, it has the opportunity to block the award of the remaining amount, following two steps: first $100 billion additional and then, in the end, $50 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress in negotiations
Although the President can put his veto on this decision, Congress has the possibility to put it into minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining funds for the purchase of bad real estate, the value of which fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgage, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "bipartial effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The President of the Senate Banking Committee, Chief negotiator Christopher Dodd, said that legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the disagreement agreement, the plan’s running on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for limiting these golden parachutes for the directors of companies participating in the programme, and it establishes a committee that will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards a deal that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides aid for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new bills in the case of mortgage that it will buy, while reducing the debtors’ monthly amounts and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A Psychological Aid
According to Patria Finance economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“And this is due to the fact that you don’t know what the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets with problems is.
This point will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government,” Marek said on iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important that it is.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and we will consecrate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, foreseeing the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
You will be advised, how to choose
While almost all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can telephone.
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
Don’t stop there are enough reasons for obtaining an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on vinyl disc, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to occur.
But if there are vinyl discs in your staircases, with art rock, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
It is the same for music during the moves, namely compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, in the same way as a fan of the Pink Floyd would have difficulty carrying earphones purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
Here are two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown features, of course, in most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to first functions, telephone calls and SMS sending, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a variable quality camera and may, for example, use to navigate.
And if you take into account smartphones and communications, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can grind meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically watching a miracle.
But the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the lower the interval between two recharges will be seen.
And playing music is one of the most important energies.
There are rare mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this number is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, consider that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, it comes to calling you from time to time, get, to be over, a second recharge for work - this applies even to the most expensive devices.
This will not be a problem for MP3 players, who are able, after a recharge, to have a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the less performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, so much more than everyone can be connected directly to the computer, without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know to take it without reduction, given the small dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
With regard to readers, you do not need, except for (iPod), any software.
Just fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library classified by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then by the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, as Windows Explore, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more knowledge
In choosing a concrete apparatus, you are especially interested in the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is essentially a background noise for you, and if in the day you’re going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, it’s enough for you to read any mobile MP3.
Almost all mobiles are able to do so today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
Everyone can read the MP3 and the vast majority of music that will come to you until you have this format.
It is one of the most common formats, and besides it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), as regards it, is less common.
High-range mobiles also allow, for example, online purchase of music.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for purchasing a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is, in most cases, limited to fast-made radio tubes.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of purchasing music (whether by GSM, the internet, or even by wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on their own.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
It’s also important if you always have headphones or a handheld with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use built-in pregnancies, which have almost all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest usually costs less than 3,000.
For a price of 3,000 crowns, you can have a walkman already very convenient.
But, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best-equipped, also provided with an entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, however, have the advantage of having an easy order.
True, anyone who manages to ensure the order of the rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by an immense data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g., Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can even come out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, instead choose the specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and so the control failure approaches that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone farther in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) above, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Or maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offer virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still miss something - a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have repeatedly mentioned on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher with us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed.
This is why, following the European Commission's last steps in the area of roaming fees regulation, a paradoxal situation is likely to occur – SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the battle.
This may seem paradoxal, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that largely exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators love to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who repeatedly stated that there was no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, made chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network apparently has much more luck (otherwise, now it would only find frequencies hard).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was just the entry of virtual operators to the mobile market that led to a significant drop in prices, to which they subsequently also had to respond to classic operators.
Nevertheless, even before the entry of trouble feasts such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today at our home were left to be heard in the UK.
But it seemed that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not forced to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Adding that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which, among other things, owns the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In order for their operation to be effective, they actually need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the cost of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network, relatively high.
This is how virtual operators in the world profile themselves as low-cost operators – they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers in the UK at least twice less expensive SMS than its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, bet on an unusual target group can also be a good hit of advertising.
In fact, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and they can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would likely be able to walk at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone’s spokeswoman, doubts: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
As far as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service supply."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are discussing the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promoting.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries of our area,” said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, Penta Financial Group spokeswoman.
It therefore indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not favourable to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not hidden, long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We have a lot to be able to offer to our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile services.
And the sooner it will be the best.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl Group spokeswoman.
Maybe the future is promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator before the end of the year.
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
“Now, we don’t think there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific in comparison with others.
For the moment, no subject has been involved in a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefonika O2 press department, in its statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not registered for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a base."
"It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited time, we should now have a concrete agreement.”
Vodafone focuses on fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said in this respect: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
That’s what we think is the most input from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean a rise in competition, would have led to a price drop and thus a decrease in their profits.
So what is good to facilitate the arrival of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to hear each other as larron in fairs. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to it.
The most apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, during the creation of the U:fon, was that of the company T-Mobile.
Providing information accessible to the public from the websites of the ČTÚ.
Today, U:fon is ready to use itself as an argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted this: “Competition on the mobile market has been recently enlarged by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player, and especially its services, would submit it to high demands."
However, given the attitude of the mobile operators herein, the indifference of the Czech regulators appears to be disregarding.
However, it is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike the UK and other developed countries, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
But the latter adopted, faced with this problem, his typical position.
The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible as a result of the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has a priori not presented sufficient interest for classical operators," said Kristián Chalupa in response to our question at the UOHS Department of Foreign Relations.
A statement thus made would not be surprised by the representatives of the operators.
But from one office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among others, also take care, that no one profits from his position on the market, such a statement is more than disruptive.
More than Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be found that their market entry has contributed to a lower price of mobile phone services."
But pressing in the sense of fair functioning of the market and price drops is apparently not part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which is derived from their reactions.
The question, if this is really an accident, is natural.
Similarly, a gasoline price is strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to random and hard fighting competition.
"The Office did not raise any signs of anti-competitive behavior in this regard, so it has no reason to interfere in one way or another.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none has an increased accountability for their behaviour in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even the telecommunications regulator,” Chaloupa said in a statement.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ that telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts offer a different vision of things: in order to make a virtual operator possible, each time we need to obtain the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has logically enough monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should at least be concerned for the UOHS that three mobile operators are visiblely proceeding in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many stakeholders (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
To regain responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the ÚOHS washs the hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, we have failed to bring about the newization of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, an extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
This is what the representatives of the UOHS have to know, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can walk
This says that the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, many in the Czech mobile networks, remains unrecognized.
These companies are publishing their own price list of mobile phone services, but these are only public in part.
In most cases, it is about multi-level marketing companies.
Personalized mobile phone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
Price lists of these companies usually only arrive at elected ones.
The magic tour consists in the fact that the company is made in front of the operator is a classic business client, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special prizes (and other) offers.
What makes a problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such sales.
"If what you're talking about happened, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions we'd examine and which could lead to a cease-fire of cooperation with the company in question," Martina Kemrová replied.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not been achieved to the managers of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned there may be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, pronounces against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies provide unnecessary profits, and at the same time, in contrast to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card on their phone is not recorded under their name, so they can’t have it fully, in the way of ordinary customers of mobile operators.”
But that is exactly what should look strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question is raised to the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not want to meet the explanations of the operators, who claim no idea that this would occur, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a significant decline in the price of services.
However, in almost all countries where virtual operators appeared, classic operators, sometimes more, sometimes less, endeavored to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
At that level, however, the regulators intervened in the developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
As well as by formal measures as by informal pressure, they eventually gained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the way a hot potato can get rid of it by transmitting it to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in their skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the cognac.
If the streaming information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at us, the Czech mobile market may turn into a move.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will only be difficult to remain intolerant to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And maybe we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new records of the national hymn Kde domov moj (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is assured by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek regards the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose to interpret solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
“Since the beginning, I’ve tried to take care of both singers, as well as the choir, to have a good dictionary, so that we can understand the words they sing simultaneously,” he said.
The Czech national hymn will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde home moj retentit for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské theatre in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of the Councils), original Czech piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people thought it was spontaneously appropriate.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple became naturally an integral part of the national hymn.
He will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Public transport (MHD) will introduce the puzzle in their ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will be recorded in the history of the Pražský Dopravní Entrepreneurship (Pragus Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will get into the subway, trams and buses, which instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for approximately 100 thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (that will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both store it on their card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní Entrepreneur (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Lukaská hradrov Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží zaešovice, Kaśnyň, Rajčeň, Anděl
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of purchasing coupons online on the websites of the Dopravní enterprise: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people enjoyed the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget the guichets in the subway stations, where they had to be pitched with impatience in long curves in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon on the internet and will be stored on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is a guide with trained staff available to passengers, which will help those interested in purchasing the internet and will also register the coupon they bought on their card," said Martin Opatrný, spokesman of the project.
Beside the libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the composing machines of tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
Automatic controls the coupon instead of the driver
Automatics that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surroundings of the city.
I.e. in the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by residents of the Central Bohemian municipalities to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport in Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with which they determine the temporary and zoneal validity of coupons;" said the Philip Drápal ticket control of Ropid organization, which designs the schedules of public transport in Prague.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
During the landing, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the location indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of registered coupons.
"If the passenger would have to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than requesting this information to the driver," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take perurban buses and do not remember the date when their coupon expires, may join the automatic distributors, initially used to store coupons on the map.
This is where, on the screen of the device, information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Southeasts demand a referendum in the United States
The Germans of the South demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This comes from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of the Southern Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This comes from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is today deposited in the collections of Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov pray in the letter to the U.S. President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemian) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation well and we want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter says, “People to whom the fate of the Šumava holds in heart.”
Given that the pledge with the Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, unfair attitude, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the U.S. President to take in his hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of millions of people," the letter said.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire to vengeance of the Czech oppressors.
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his residents wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the postwar history, appear slightly naïve, according to some survivors, illustrate well the expectations of the Germans of the Southern of that time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least intervene that the issue of their expulsion from the Republic would be raised, very few of them would admit such a possibility.
Some were expecting that the United States and the UK would get some kind of autonomy for the Suezs.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to learn the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czechs would be profitable to them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, would be expelled from the Republic, following the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign only in order to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček’s office believes that it will discourage drivers of dangerous driving.
This campaign costs 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers of fast driving and alcohol on the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
She especially wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also testifies to the "blowing" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You Don't Think" is written in majors on the registration plate.
Then, in a sheet of blood, there is the phrase "Tu payeras".
Which must symbolize that we can pay for life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has inspired similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can commonly see images with drastic images of victims of accidents.
It estimates that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and foam strategy against drivers
"What goes with the drivers is the system of sugar and foam.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when they grill a red fire.
It's the threat of a penalty or accident.
The risks must be recalled to drivers,” said Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need news campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist said.
Panels that report the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns about danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would make almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Provisional Government, pronounced in favour of the restitution of almost all occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, Jerusalem and the eastern Golan heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all territories (occupied), or even all,” Olmert said in a statement.
“We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory), because without that, peace will not be done,” he said.
He admits that the possible refund would comprise East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crash his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted by announcing the two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and tens of people were wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for Mount du Temple, sacred and historic places" within the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israel’s sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he said later.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also pronounced the retirement of Israel from the Golan heights, which, according to him, constitutes an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retirement," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Chite Movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they have to grant to Hamas (Chite Movement), Al-Qaeda (Terrorism Network) Iraq, as well as that of Saint Djihad.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move within the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said the spokesman of the transport ministry Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old host died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus road.
The young girl was sadly sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at its disposal.
But the bus may have an accident, or even suddenly brake, even when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the car is under its technical sheet equipped with standing places or not.
If this seating equipment is not approved, passengers must remain sitting.
The long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing places; which has been confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the company’s director Radim Jančura.
“This is a question we have addressed with the Ministry and, at the beginning, it bans all travelling of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we found that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey, provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no unique legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription is concerned with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The road transport law only knows the term of a vehicle recipient; it does not define its rights and duties," added the spokesman Hanzelka more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, is, on the contrary, estimated that the law handles the problem sufficiently.
“Everything depends on whether the car has permission to offer standing places in its approval.
Everything is in there," he said.
The buses are divided into urban places, where there are standing places and maximum speed, interurbans with standing places and higher permitted speed and long distance buses without space with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, an expert said.
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP expert in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"After regular circulation, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
There also, it is not sure when there will be turbulence and air hostility can climb the head."
“In the case of the bus being suddenly braked, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in a city bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal requirements," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewards services.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their career as a risk career.
"However, as soon as I feel like it's a risky business, I'll remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and journal at the landing.
This would also reduce costs,” he said.
The security concern is the reason it gives to the absence of stewards in its vehicles the Asian director Alexeï Litvine, which, compared to SA, ensures a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hosts. We've been opposing it since the beginning.
Soon or later this will end by a deadly accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
There is a huge tragedy
A young host in the Plzeň region, who worked for the company for two years, died in the Naples line crash.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop belt without using climbing and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he threw it on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to complain against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the young girl's family, the agency will not expect the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also counts on the guilty.
An amendment to the law?
Not in view
An amendment to the law, which has been developed for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the travel of stewards on the bus.
"They haven't made any conclusions on that point.
Truely, it is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, at the highest speed on the highway and the use of the carrier on the wheel," Hořín said.
"The transport ministry does not consider stewards' activity as a thing that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," said the spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of police and the work security office.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The big words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Directorate Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the Dusseldorf Financial Institute entities with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could be established, according to the e-mail made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
Overall, such a relationship could be the decisive shift to other concentrations in the Länder banks sector.
This is what it looks like when a management committee aims to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is always under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Supervisory Authority of Financial Services, which, just recently, has clearly revealed to the Government of North Rhineland that the time was counted in the search of a future solution.
However, it has been questioned for some time - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of any form between the Deka Bank, who knew the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Of course, the chief of Deta-Bank Franz Waas informed during the presentation of the figures in the late August that he saw no sense in the merger of Mainzer Landstrasse's house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the Länder banks and the group of stock stocks, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct negotiations with the WestLB for common commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or part of it.
However, the talks are only beginning, it is said in the financial place.
It is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, counts for one of the most important employers on the Frankfurt financial market, enters into the game where it is about consolidating the cash sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinat and Halbab.
Nothing has come out of this terminal bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the Hesse Land Government had pronounced against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses did not join.
The Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinat was linked to the Land Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treatments on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hellaba, had pronounced against any trade strategy of merger with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to spread that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the Bavarian parliamentary election has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bade-Wuttenberg Land Bank could first be concreted.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that requires new fusions should increase, the potential partners will gradually escape him.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far better resisted the crisis than Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba’s capital, on the contrary, took a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
The NordLB will remain strict.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another issue asks how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be assorted.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, through what model of commercial capacity should be ensured by the Länder banks, had not been resolved by the German group of stockpiles and transfers.
In the end, a waste of the WestLb could take place, waste which is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter of the ongoing management committee: in any case, a 'global solution' for the institution would be addressed.
How all this will be placed in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a tonne of five liters of beer from the Kaiser brand, a well-built barbecue stands that shows to about 200 visitors to the beer party what deep sounds it can produce.
Elena tapes first Luca, then kiss her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the road station near the station Puorta Nova, four buses take the departure tonight at 23:45, 'destinazione Monaco, party della bera', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one bus travelling exclusively from Brazil.
In a parking corner, South Americans sing before and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also sounds, explains Marco Guarda, that is not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which wears a long double-minded shirt and glasses with large silver mounts.
For five years, they went to the beer party, already three turns to nothing but this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 22:30.
It would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs €75, including the welcome pot with a beer Kaiser, broke in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and an official of the German-speaking group - Marco made a language course in Frankfurt.
And already buses are driving at night on the Autostrada direction 'Brennero'.
There's no beer yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, travellers sleep.
This is better, they will still need their strengths.
Pause will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates once again take a pause just before Munich, on highway 8.
In the morning, the Marco group finally arrives at six o’clock as expected at the parking lot near the Teresa Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others meet together, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First: Hair from the small yellow casket.
Dessus is written on the left 'Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the website of Marco's travel agency 'conscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: “When the doors of the beer headquarters open, we shorten,” Marco cries in the morning.
'Corri!' Run and book the places at the bottom of the tent.
‘Don’t be in front, or we’re blocked, and not all the yellow caskets on the same banks, we need to distribute them into the room!’
The chope, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the consignment!
Show security agents that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your places, they're gone!"
Third, 'Tonight, being here is ten and a half hours!' Do you understand?
And that's it, he went to the beer party.
On the way, somebody has yellow caskets on the trees to find the way, on the panels and even to a electoral post of a large popular Bavarian party.
We're going to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer party, known as the Italian weekend.
There are no precise figures; we talk about 50,000 who run through the Alps and collapsed in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police is reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, by Italian volunteer rescue officers supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which performs statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (around 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The Italians particularly appreciate it is the tent of the Hofbräu Brasserie.
Nights of insomnia for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, said the Federal Finance Minister just a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word "relatively" and that the German banking sector would not be saved by crisis movements.
This is actually happening this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to DAX, receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid appropriations were issued up to €35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes as much from private banks as from public law banks.
In the background, it is Depfa’s company that supports losses.
The state finance, according to a newspaper article, had been refinancing in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of trust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the net capital rate was also slightly reduced from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current profits and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period of the previous year, zero-point profits from the allocation of certain bonds and securities, as well as the termination of stocks in credit transactions had fallen from more than EUR 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
It is only due to the significant profits resulting from the refund of the ex-Depfa accounting costs, as well as the refund of interests according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies, that the deficit of approximately 16 per cent of profits has been moderated.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state finance had initially failed to speculate on industrial real estate loans, which were subsequently affiliated with the Aareal bank.
Since classical state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa was then more intensively engaged in infrastructure projects and in joint projects funding between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must carry out amortisations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group’s profits and losses that still remains quite fluent.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputed.
For 2007, they had been swallowed to two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been, since the purchase of Depfa, a highly important state investor and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the inter-bank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the bank’s bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks again significantly took place, the banks accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate requires annually a portion of the total Depfa credits of a short-term refinancing medium – about €50 billion.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding of the group is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected by the influence of international financial markets largely outside the state of running.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through funds by the end of 2009.
In contrast, the chairman of the HRE Board Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to apply to the medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) are based on the principle that the Hypo Real Group’s capacity on the market is now guaranteed.
The bank’s shareholders and borrowers have only to expect it.
However, given the dynamic and impoverishability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
However, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used throughout its scope.
But the opposite can also not be removed.
After the bank is still at the doors of insolvency on Sunday at the end of evening, this savings for the least temporary will not be able to refresh the minds as well.
The rate of the share decreased from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The course of obligations, on the other hand, is particularly well-behaved.
While debt to the first leader has barely moved, the second-plan loan rates are flooding.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo company and, of course, those who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate Bank seemed previously to be an alternative speculation investment, and now their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that made the crisis into the establishment by the Depfa bank purchase.
As long as emissions institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the resorption of rearrangements is over time.
Or it will happen what no one expects at this moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached certainty today has become a merely founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia, above all, for long-term creditors on the decision whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they’ve drawn on to make a delay of losses for the next years on the revenue tax of stock exchange gains automatically taken.
Sylvana and the secrets of the bow in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, has to appear for the first day at the High School of Tachibana, girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
“The first day of the course in Japan.
What was I excited about?
The way to go to school was scared.
I live in the periphery of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to the High School of Tachibana.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I haven't lost myself.
The start of the course does not seem to be fixed as strictly as at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear each other from eight hours until at nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the professor, the "home room".
But before the course began, it was me to present myself.
I don’t like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven’t had the school uniform yet, I put an old juice of my mother’s host, as well as a shirt, blue leather shoes and black leather shoes.
In this dress, therefore, I presented myself in front of the pupitre, and I tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
All the 31 girls in the class have made the downheads, laughed, and made signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly moved to my place.
The girl next to me made me a great ironic smile, she found it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong sounded, I was attacked in the rules.
Everyone talked to who better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case it's quite difficult to understand English.
During the break, they all went out of their Bento.
My welcome mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the poor in German cases.
I had rice for aromatic herbs, small sauces, a concrete salad and algae, fruits and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange look and a completely new taste.
What's sure is that everything is really good.
Well, unless the salt prunes confined, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to make the boy a little better knowledge during the break.
I read this in my hands.
I'm curious if I could see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
“Because it fascinates me, what?”
Finally, reading mangas is what I’ve preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture that is there, at one point, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have feelings as well.
A rat or a cafard flees from danger, does that mean that he also feels scared?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we verify that he experiences the same thing when he behaves in the same way as we?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of answers to the question "What do you think to be true without having proof?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other state of consciousness without me or anyone else could prove it so far as we can’t prove that other human beings have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or generally consciousness, we will enter hardly practiced grounds because the Hardware does not correspond.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same as many other animals: he does death, escape or attack.
Human beings behave in the same way, so some scientists deduce a comparable subjective life.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective life to that of animals difficult.
One of the aspects is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal side cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and directional and executive functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
Therefore, at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the linguistic nature of man: a large portion of his existence being connected to language, that often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness should not depend on the language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, regardless of how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our consciousness states.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can resemble in other animals.
If this, internally and subjectively, is neither allowed to measure nor, because of this particular Hardware, to analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious life, but there is a further aspect of consciousness that should be more easily scientifically accessible.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that was exactly what happened in short-term studies on primates memory, especially with the example of visualisation.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualisation.
But what does it result from emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system localized in the brain (or its successes, such as the reactions of the body) occurs from living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, decay, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them to others other than ourselves.
On the contrary, for example, Antonio Damasio thinks that the sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of the body sensation of Cortex and the brain tronce, as well as Jaak Pankseep who focuses yet more on the brain tronce.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could totally participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I believe it's incomplete.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in Men and rats is likely as such in both cases: however, how can one verify whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cafard runs out of danger, but what if he feels scared?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical behaviors.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain throats, but cafards do not even have a brain.
But is the brain tronce the origin of feelings?
And even if we could prove this to man: how can we demonstrate it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to demonstrate it.
And because their feelings seem to differ completely from ours (although human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress is punished in the nerve level to the extent that the same is stirred in rats and in humans.
As I don’t explore language and consciousness in rats, or feelings, I don’t know if they exist.
It could be considered as a short term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly climbing against a wall.
I am an emotional pragmatic.
Platini, UEFA President: a deadline of gratitude for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the calendar of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European championship could potentially be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We must work at the maximum speed,” said the President of the Ukrainian League, Grigorij Surkis.
“Uefa constantly watched us.”
A more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee was meeting on the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be “a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules,” said Drzewiecki from the Polish press agency PAP.
"We made sure in a letter to the President of the UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were, already in the previous season, convicted for the manipulation of mandatory relief; in the end, the beginning of the League was even delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid Independent Anti-Attack
She wanted to promote a new film, she talked about her privacy in an interview - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her ex adult Dennis Quaid.
He ecuates - and counter-attack.
A late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, both Hollywood actors come to a disgraceful battle - seeing and knowing everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for American newspaper InStyle on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have been aware of the scope of fraud only after divorce.
The motive of this thought strip is in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his unfaithful husband’s qualification fell clearly: it would be “monster,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News that “I end up again the history of our relationship and manipulate it.”
It would be more "reproachable" that "the punishment and the burdens that involve a divorce for each child should be rebuilt in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan lives alone since divorce, Quaid married again and will soon become the father of twins.
His answer to the strike was: "In any case, my life continues.
I’m glad to have a wonderful family that’s going to be the best.”
Prices of airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than last year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50%.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the American Express Financial Services and Travel Provider.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price rise in the first quarter, a net decline in profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, hotels nights have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices increased by an average of 6.1 percent in 41 out of 48 European cities, compared to 2007, in 41 out of 48 European cities.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would be for American Express at the low price of the dollar that led to a “decreasing want of travel to American tourists”.
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the city of Sweden, hotel prices rise by 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of cherosene, economic-class passengers paid on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-term flights, very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for economic class tickets fell by 12.5% on average compared to the previous quarter, business class and first class, however, price variations were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 1.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to the study.
The reasons for this price drop would be a smooth economic growth on the one hand, the company explains.
The demand would come from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure on competition by the Treaty "Open Sky" which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the stressed situation is the removal of non-profit airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV Bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg becomes the first in ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still failed to find a functional eleventh.
De Kristoffer Klein. Agrandir. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only returns late into the game and his rising shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," siffles Hermann Rieger in the costume hall at the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn't much in the dressing room, the half-time was over and most of them were raising in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapeut of the HSV for almost three decades, enjoying a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that is why his application was received in strategic places.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquired and lifted the inch to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach head of Hamburg Martin Jol.
So the orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The implementation was missing.
“Everything wasn’t very nice to see today,” Grandpa Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "suggested to be more relaxed as well."
This 1:0 (1:0 in the mid-time), Hamburg's team owes it to a successful head strike by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not harm the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a dirty victory,” said Marin Jol.
The SV in Hamburg will celebrate its 121th birthday on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the gigantic screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to get back,” Marcell Jansen said.
It is suspected that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals – the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the target guard Petric as well as Jansen debuted from the FC Bayern – forms slightly, but it is still not shining.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol said.
After the failure of the vote
At Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan made the Dow Jones temporarily fall by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, Dow Jones got a bit off.
About 20:30 a.m., the world's most important stock exchange index was 10.579 points with a decrease of about five percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index was 1548 points with a decrease of over seven points.
The most losers of Dow Jones were at that date American Express who lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could no longer report profits.
The Goldman Sachs Bank’s shares accused of a decline of nearly ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilised for the purchase of what is called broken mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid at once, but gradually.
On the contrary, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in relation to the change of the course in order to reduce its burden for the Public Treasury.
Courses of Actions Aspired to the Torbillon in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not fall into the concerns of investors.
The share course of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapsed despite the financial market rescue planned by the state.
Spectacular declines in Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank courses have led to a deep deficit in German index (Dax).
The Bavarian real estate finance has currently lost three-quarters of its value despite the federal government rescue operation and private banks, Commerzbank accused of a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax drained significantly below the significant psychological bar of the 6,000 points and was at 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent deficit.
All over the world, share markets have fallen to the knees.
In New York, Wall Street worked with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be enough to restart the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809,25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States had the intention to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote should follow on October 1.
The other European scholarships also experienced only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index accused of a decrease of 3.2% at the moment, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the main Japanese index Nikkei fell to 11.743.61 points after a rise from 1.26 percent.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
The multinational business and tourism company has further informed that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" is flying into space.
Because of fuel pipelines soon frozen, cryogenic death threatens.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been the cause of distortion among the researchers - the abnormality of gravitational support.
Gravitative support is a maneuver of space probes, through which they get an additional elan in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example Earth.
So the sondes can save a lot of fuel.
The U.S.-European Cassini-Huygens was using this physical trick, as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
That’s what researchers are surprised for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100 per cent in the way they are expected to do according to the venerate laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at speed level.
The sondes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicians could not explain this effect.
They called him the anomalie of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to space curve, may not be completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still believes that Einstein is not mistaken and is trying to explain the abnormality of gravitational support using the so-called black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Black matter could be responsible for this abnormality, which is also near the Earth,” he wrote.
Space researchers have only known the existence of black matter for about ten years.
It appears to have a force of attraction, whose effect is observed on other celestial bodies.
It, however, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists taken from Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their deceasers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released and the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed that.
Sudanese rabbits had demanded a salary of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six kidnappers would have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were taken away.
Negotiations for the redemption would already be undertaken.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
WELT ONLINE draws the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visiblely free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have announced in concert.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the newsletters of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other kidnappers were released.
“We’re checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well-behaved and safe, the Egyptian national television said.
The 19 participants of the desert trip should already be on the way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting before the kidnappers were still flooded: so the kidnappers would have been nearly to put an end to the kidnappers, according to an Egyptian security agent, before the Sudanese army kills six kidnappers without screaming at the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the agent said.
It remained only to collect the kidnappers," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six rappers on Sunday in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two of them had arrested.
The occupants had demanded from Germany a salary of six million euros; the money had to be returned by the German woman from one of the occupants.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of kidnappers took delay because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the article, rabbits wanted to release female kidnappers after paying the savings.
Men had to be kept until the rabbits found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a beautiful father who led to suicide."
A court has been informed that years of abuse inflicted by his grandfather led a woman to suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57-year-old of Stithians, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight heads of charges for pathways of indecent facts.
Truro's high-instance court said he regularly linked his cousin, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood age from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that 34-year-old Melle Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise had attached and banned her before forced her to sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornouailles.
Her daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court has been informed that Ms. Randle, a National Trust volunteer assistant, was treated with abuse that had been inflicted to her twice a week.
Attorney-General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Mrs Randle, who was a good surfing and cyclist, seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "has lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she got suicide by sucking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter who had, on the other hand, wrote a confession letter that ended with this: “I regularly attached him and banded him.”
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: “You are really strange as a fetish, your victim should certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of seven.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And even more surprisingly, it is that if she hadn’t done this, her story would certainly never end in court.”
He added: “I particularly emphasize, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office’s minister who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June will be convicted by the Officeicial Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The man of the Ministry of Defense was moving when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were transferred into the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least severe condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intention.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would think that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Office Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violation of section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause concerning the backup of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the head of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of its work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained appreciations on Al-Qaeda as well as on security forces' resources in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Companies of the building facing the B&B bill.
British building companies may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savings.
The interests of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money of the savings, including 59 companies of the building.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it was "irrational" to know that companies and their members would have to pay the broken pots.
The £14 billion loan will be refunded when Bradford & Bingleys’ mortgage is released.
But interests that will increase at the same time will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions who have had a prudent behavior now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company has to pay a amount proportionate to its deposits, and that intermediate companies have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the loan interest rates will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to adjust interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Commercial Committee for Building Companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It's "irrational" to see that institutions who have had a careful behavior during the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less careful institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first anale.
"We must examine all aspects of this case over the next few weeks to evaluate the options to be taken to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salt bill," Cole said.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, we will need to pay interests throughout the year, which could also double.
Since building companies are non- shareholder organizations, their member ends up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five penny per liter
People in Jersey need to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny to liter, from Monday.
This is the second price rise resulting from a two-penny rise in February, and occurs as a result of a research conducted by a consulting company.
retailers have to decide whether they are going in their turn, increasing the price of consumers.
. Before the rise of February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last varied in 2002.
Bangladesh's former PM rejected caution
A court in Bangladesh rejected a claim to former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested when he returned to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his warranty due to his examination for extortioning a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000,00) when she was PM.
This is one of the many charges made to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's always rival, was relaxed with caution earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's temporary military government first give him its entire freedom.
Reporters emphasized that the terms of his release are contradictory because if he is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free when she returned to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying she does not require any warranty because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," she said.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this guarantee to return to the country to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
It was detained last year after the military interim government took over power, but was released in June to cure abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denied the charges they made.
Anxiety for the Afghan antipoly campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent immunization campaign against the polio due to violence related to the Taliban, the UN said.
The UN conducted a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But she says she has failed to contact the children of the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A spokesperson from the United Nations said that this has happened despite the Taliban’s promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB lost the ITV Judicial Battle
BSkyB has lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would oblige it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that MSkyB’s participation in the past had prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV injustice.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement aimed at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase of ITV shares by BSkyB raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, which, consequently, encouraged the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and Ofcom regulator were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB has recalled that it would not be reasonable to reduce its shares of ITV and, on the contrary, it was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just resigned from its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of American prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney-General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the release of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All this was born from the report of the case of the General Inspector of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the White House officials, lawmakers and former Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim their release is due to political causes.
The Special Attorney, Nora Dannehy, will now investigate whether the officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators, obstructing justice.
“Severe potentially criminal, unfunded accusations of conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accused capable of forced witnesses to submit was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute begins with the radiation of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department had stated that the prosecutors were dismissed due to medium-sized benefits.
But later it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more critical than their other colleagues, which encouraged some observers to award to these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate fraudulent votes against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be released at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The Chief of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has finally been accused of being involved in this issue of dismissal, and he has finally resigned.
A number of ministerial officers of the Department of Justice also gave their resignation.
The report of the Inspector General was very critical to the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, declaring that he considered him the "first responsible" for these dismissals, and finally "abdicating" his role of leader," notably successfully not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former employee, Karl Rove, have been critical for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's ephod should be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf is awarded the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar during the London ceremony next week, said he was "honored" to obtain this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The award discount evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely gone.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was introduced in the UK, as a single in 1979, ranking on the fifteenth place.
In addition, its album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his heartbeat became irregular, after collapsing on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced her to cancel concerts.
Then he found a cyst in his voice cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-term local residents don't know how to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and crosses north of First Street- not confusing with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide for 120 lengths, it looks like a pushing path rather than an active artery.
.No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other fans, including long-standing neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the latest and oldest streets of the house paste.
But the Department of Preservation and Development Real Estate of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighbouring owners committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have developed a proposal authorising the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the city's hands, and asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, local manager of the Committee No.3.
"There are only few spaces belonging to the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
“They could suggest re-state it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repain the small street and install there seats, some would be used by a coffee shop where the manufacturer will allow space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relooker this abandoned stream, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest sales to him."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Real Estate Conservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, emphasising that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical fingerprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the inheritance of the great farm of many Philip Minthorne children was divided, leaving the small end of the earth, which has remained abandoned.
The later entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened to Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' Rocket to Russia's album.
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of railroads, railroads, barrels, posters, leaves, and rods."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken about evolution to East Village’s luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others proclaimed Extra Place as a true rareness—a virtually identical fragment of the city that should be shipped in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (under the title "The Book of Contestations: A Nostalgic Regard on A City in the Process of Extinction") relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow pocket bag, dark of day as night, and delimited by the doors of a wrapped iron warehouse and persians, full of last week's newspapers flying along the droplets."
With little exceptions nearby, the street always has the same trail.
A short mouse climbing at the bottom of the road, close to a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 oz empty beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown.
Some passagers have stated that they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its emphasis.
Mr. Field, from his point of view, said that some underestimated the attraction of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "are held in dark, wet and delicious places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervisory Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former study member in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you do not think. Why middle class should be able to choose their school."
Attaching the favors of Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals for education are an interesting example.
Obama’s campaign stresses that “Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
In order to combat these differences, Obama’s educational program supports in particular among many other subjects, “transitional bilingual education” for those who learn English.
However, the question asked for Obama is whether his desire to carry out a bilingual education that defends education in classes other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school in the east of Los Angeles County.
Students of this school are largely Spanish, and low income.
More than one-third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 Mathematics State Exam, expert level.
Similarly, nearly 93% of students passed the English-language exam of art.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than Mr. Obama’s advanced.
Sixth Street puts on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment, as well as an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, that this school has initiated the teaching of the English language "full immersion".
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a huge success with a student who just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without her class, you would have had no chance to identify her."
"It works," she observed, "it has worked for us."
Mr. Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and reply it in other schools consisting of most Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school are talking about themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education long support bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
Although it is favourable for immigrants to learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he declared that we must all stop questioning the bible of English-language laws.
"On the contrary," he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than demarcate them or consider them insignificant.
Nette oil fall after the news of the world’s economy
Oil prices have fallen significantly on Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan for financial steps fails to return life to the economy.
Gross oil operations dropped by 7% to $99.80 per baril. The New York Mercantile Exchange, at the sales of this morning.
Prices have fallen more than $20 at the bar since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been cut off by Wall Street’s financial agitation, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After seeing an increase of $145.29 at the baril, prices fell to nearly $90 at the baril this month, before resuming the deep uncertainty of the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the rescue agreement, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news was relieved by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the last episode of this financial catastrophe," Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the frenetic negotiations this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement, seemed to have failed to bring the market back."
While the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
“The prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contamination.
“In terms of raw materials, our most urgent concern is to understand how much the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China.”
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the falls in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, and were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Time Determining Party for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending in the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform with the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals even played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor sign of one afternoon during which their relationship made a bond forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell, and the second, 10 seconds from half-time.
"I didn't leave my area" Favre said about all his passings in Coles.
"He's a middle-aged player"
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing the catch, the defense beat the quarter back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards until touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens left the ball to escape due to Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens ball could be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of this possession over the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20 yards goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could mark in some time.
"Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second time or the third time?"
When the two Jets told him they left 21 unquestionable points in the third time, Mangini said: "I can tell you that I loved the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in short time."
Gebrselassie rests, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved to be worthy of his title as the best background racer of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 of an adjacent race on the plate, Gebrselassie won 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, disputed last year in Berlin.
At 35 years old, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of her great career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, scaring-- can be overwhelmed in today's eyes,- that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
He promised to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect sunny weather conditions, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the reduction of the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered crashes in the mollet two weeks before, and had missed the training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not roasted.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I gave it back last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best.”
He was opposed - especially in Kenya, the Ethiopian rival - to have too much orchestrated his race, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the liver as if they were in a track competition, and considering the world records more than the meaning of the competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the size of Gebrselassie’s capabilities as a background racer.
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04 on my way.
Two Kenya elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the band heads disappeared.
A little more than three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made its final retreat to depart from Kwambai, which ended second at 2:05:36, improving its best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis came third at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, ended a remarkable year gaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She couldn't participate in Beijing games due to a bad back hypothesis, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skillful strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a great advantage, then exceeding them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, ended third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the pride and the trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of his immense park, a few miles from the sunshine, the brilliant and gigantic Orlando, is a quiet small town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first fully black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood house, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so easy to make today." The city at five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a pilgrimage city.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival that takes place every year in Eatonville to honor Hurston, the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she described has become a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression era Federal Writers Project remains a separate place.
She is also independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston told the black rural population of Florida that she was often refusing to share her real thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he's losing."
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who, on the other hand, invoked an open dialogue on the subject of the race, many here remain cautious from the foreign view.
“We’re very careful about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, who has been a resident of the city and the oldest Parish woman.
"It must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black power capturing as well as a community of nearly 2400 people, where the rate of poverty is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture – sometimes departure, sometimes acclaimed – that reminds the birth of American slavery.
That would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown throughout the world through honest books full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just on the outskirts of Route 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, which encompasses in chapters of black history and human drama.
A brave such a big cash in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the ownership store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"Pass the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and these well-conserved play areas that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can hardly read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash’s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn” sells all kinds of drinks and everything that can serve people in the past.
So, almost a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a self-government but also with alphabetization, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't.
It wasn’t a portrait that everyone enjoyed.
Zora has well described the reality ", said Ella Dinkins, a 90-year-old, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston has immortalized, citing colorless songs, interpreted by men who praise their beauty."
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
We always remember Hurston as a living and excentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he further added, knocking in his chair of the later patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
After Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was formerly a star of literature, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20s, she was buried in a tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great memorial, no plate for the large audience.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or heritage she offered to the world,” said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to make a five-way highway in the city, to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main street on two-ways in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just resuming from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mixing of races led hate to the gates of the community.
"At that time, a band of young white people came to throw oranges or objects against people sitting on the beach," Franklin said.
"A lady is even dead."
They put a paste in their car.”
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education’s insulting rather than glorifying my race.
Residents now declare that the elimination of racial separation in schools, although positive in some aspects, diluted Eatonville’s cohesion and weakened young people’s trust.
"The black children were used to be kissed - I remember - we kissed our master in the morning, and the evening as well," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, and chief director of the Eatonville Community Security, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the time when teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white professor because he’s white – I mean there’s a line of cultural demarcation here,” said Nathiri.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have enabled the creation of space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the damage, such as her, armed with a joyful self-confidence and behaviour lines such as: "How can they get away from the pleasure of my company!"
That's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed on Hurston directed by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The highway project came just at the moment when Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston see her as a rescue.
The community started organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this highway would take.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, a real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Mrs Boyd summarized all the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been visiting our church since 1993, began to come in a large number, and the residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A monothematic library (renommated of course Hurston) works in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaid.
Today, Eatonville remains an abnormality for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can be regarded at any time as a rear street at a summer rain day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Nowadays, 90 percent of blacks are counted)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason to be, are still treated with caution.
We need to ask for permission for most interviews, and some things like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave teacher who has a weakness for living red, are always afraid that their island community will not be understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, not better or worse, but also proud, creative, foolish, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is very honest with the civil affection that we hear in the voice of the 18-year-old nephew of Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11 years old, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think: 'Oh, this city hasn't compared anything to others," Alondra Kenon said after Sunday's mess.
But if you stop and take time to consider the story, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone usually talks about finance.
However, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were away from the kiosk and giant TV screens at Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in glass offices and bees naked above their teeth, bankers and cover fund managers who monopoly New York, spend the worst "work day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
The suppliers continue to climb on the trottoirs, with their chariots and muffin plates for the morning meetings.
The Latins are always tracing between the residential buildings wearing, like mules, a fifty of luxurious shirts hanging on a yog arranged on its shoulders.
Office employees continue to buy their morning sandwich to ambulance traders, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16:00 and 19:00 a week.
I hadn’t felt the crisis despite the totally pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work at the end of the afternoon, because I was discovering at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a twenty-four people making the coat.
Not in front of the boxes, nor to withdraw from the species, nor to make a payment, but in front of the customer service box, where the usual customers ordered their checks, the tourists asked for the direction for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," all made the cow for the same reason as I did.
Not the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from the thrifts accounts called the building company, credit associations, and the type of local savings cashes and their subsidiaries that only work in one state, and say treating customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In the last days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank, has used the bankruptcy union, and while the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and shop employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debt, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to them reliable, or the one that makes the most saving at Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the finance world over the past few weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking to Lehman Brothers, the bank who failed, and his weak CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the monetary fund market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to risk.”
Profane Muslim storms while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, attended a protest to present the organization of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They wear road panels illustrating red-ray mosques.
Police accuse extremists of profane an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of the extreme right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged at the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, an organized action.
Criminals have painted on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to devastate the feeling of hatred of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be somehow related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the Islamic Local Community said it was "deeply shocked" in the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of recovering its courage, following its oscillation to the right at the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme-right parties, who have scored nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to criticism, such as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the foulard and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to Alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosque and minarets, declaring that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is prohibited from traveling abroad.
The courts prohibited the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse on children, expatriation to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing his intention to travel to Spain through France to the authorities under control.
Police at Kent had given this ban on travel on Thursday after proving to the judges the blame of Glitter for sexual abuse on children.
Glitter, or his true name, Paul Gadd, was not present at Ashford's limited court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said " Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present at that time."
Glitter, 64, told the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be recorded in the list of sexual abuse charges.
He must mandatoryly inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could punish up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent police said it would not discuss any particular cases or possible Glitter moves in the county.
A spokesman from Kent Police said, “The Kent Police will do everything they need to protect our children as foreigners.
“If we do, it is easier to monitor someone staying in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more effectively.
“To protect Kent’s inhabitants is the most expensive intention of Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimise potential risks for the public.”
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after purifying 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two daughters, respectively, 10 and 11 years old.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to embark for a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel good, and he refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked it in the control of passports, and at the end he left Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused to enter their territory, and therefore were forced to return to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he should return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August, and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, was going to the limited court in Uxbridge, West London, to register on the list of sexual abuse accused, such as Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been purified for a four-month punishment in the UK for child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Interior said Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was calm and happy to know that Glitter had been prohibited from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
Neither sharks nor dresses.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed look of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in these unknown moments of the great public, where you discover intimate gestures and stealed looks of artists who don’t care to ride on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixed in "Flamenco - people" theatre of a few stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the particular iconography of flamenco in different angles.
Included in the programming of the Moon of Flamand Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day," explains the creator, which clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone, but after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, you don’t need to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a personality.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of the flamenco stars’ personality moments.”
With the festival "Popular Chant des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and hardware, recall classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: “A music with very traditional roots that evolve and surprise every day.”
It is not the dance or the singing itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with its art.
The search for essential and magic has been the constant of this work present in the El Fotómata gallery today.
Flamenco's headquarters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from around 70 photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and able to enter their lives for a more or less time.
In photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
You are facing people, characters you sometimes don’t know or who leave you just a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas become reality.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at No. 20 of the street of Mata (parallel road to the Hercules Peupleraie), which will be opened until October 16 next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true courage"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and handles unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is well determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived 20 years in the Congo and has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize’s favourite confessed yesterday at the Hay Segovia festival, that the novel that currently occupies it is “a real courage” and that “all demonstrates that he should not write it.”
“If I was reasonable, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it,” he concluded in his intervention to the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, and journalists and thousands of people moving into the city of the Aeduque.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of participants, made the theatre Juan Bravo full room.
Presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, met in front of a fascinated audience who did not see the time past during which Peru, with a wonderful memory and a large dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to the "sa passion of reading" part of the novel and the "inspiring part of the novel" part of the novel and "to live a new experience of the novel" part of the novel.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and see if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an efomeric experience," emphasized Vargas Llosa, who said that "it has the effects of writing" and "make the less like people."
Bad weather destroys Pozoblanco Fair
The banner party that concluded the poultry races at Pozoblanco Fair was suspended last morning, after the horse toreadors had verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizational committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the cattle race.
The bad weather has been hard on this fair, because at last two of the three parties were unable to take place.
Saturday is the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled cattle race.
On the show, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who had to face in the arena of Castilblanco
Only the Friday party was held.
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was triumphant, after making arm movements face to the cow with taste and aesthetic.
In the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the back of the cow and a cut ear that the discovered gradins applauded more than his struggle with the cow itself.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
When he fought with the second cow, after a much better fight, he became siffled by the majority of the public.
Police control of a furniture in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Control of circulation of the police of Euskadi (l'Ertzaintza) at the border of the Armenian Municipality (Alava).
Police arrested two occupants of a furniture and the latter two took the escape.
His load, more than two tons of hachisch, to stop them.
Police pursued and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The person who was arrested was accused of drug trafficking and fake documentation.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Traffic Unit of the Alava carried out vehicle control on the N-1, at the border of the Armenian Community.
They were preparing to stop a furniture to inspect it when the driver was disobedient to orders, suddenly accelerated and the control began.
Police began their prosecution until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further on the lower coast, where the two occupants went down to escape into a boiling area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and picked up the 2.178 kilograms of hachisch they transported and found after inspecting the furniture, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch ballots, then they were transferred to a police station for an extensive inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" as it did not coincide with the written on the grey card of the furniture, it was also for this reason that they charged the detained a crime of falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug captured.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A. A. J., has been warned to carry out the different steps and will be judged within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her doing strange manoeuvres trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman from the California police patrol revealed to the magazine People.
At about 16:30, Locklear “repeated deeply on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses.”
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who initially had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and went out of his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed disoriented," the agents led her to a drug and alcohol specialized center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was deleted from the beginning, although "as regarded by police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned at 19.00 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was invaded to treat herself with nervous depression.
Llamazars asked the Andalousian Federation of the Union to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
Union Left Coordinator and Deputy General, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sport Advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of conducting treatments for his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization to take over its responsibilities," Llamazares said in terms of the behavior of the political party he will adopt within the Seville Municipal Council.
However, the Union Left leader asked the investigations to show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Union Left has always defended this kind of business for them to have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"May's Blood" - Garci's Wedding
Inspiring the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recruited the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Blood of May", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with nearly €15 million budget.
The filmmaker has tried to "show the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, "May's Blood," will make its release in the film rooms next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Grand admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures that he has performed with this tournament "a child dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged him, three years ago, to turn a commemorative film for the two hundred years of 2 May Madrid, which he always accepted when the story held to national stories.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Community constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of a "Spain that has deceived for battle, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII."
But the filmmaker regrets not having received funding such as for the films "Capitaine Alatriste" or "The ghosts of Goya" - more than twice the one obtained for "Blood of May" - because he couldn't turn a few scripts written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with which he collaborated almost throughout his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver" started "influenced on his usual way of working, on the scenery of actors, with whom he has used to repeat before he started the tournament and to whom he does not casting, because it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the filmmaker's role is to go to the theater and to attend the film".
Many actors in "Sangre de May" repeat before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times candidate to Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, Mayo Blood » » » Seven Billard tables » and finally the winner » The blind suns », are not better-representatives of the youth-meer-Spain film.
With this film Garci doesn’t expect a price.
“Initially you think you are working for the offspring, then you realize that you are only working for prosperity, and now you are happy to make a further film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts in the skin of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will honor a Sevillan dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district and who, at the age of three, will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an eastern dance specialist.
She had a passionate life, pioneer for women’s liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and Vegetarian and plaida for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of the dancing in Europe of the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to interpret the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and that seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, “We are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dance made me think of flamenco.
So, "the papillon dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to her,” she said.
The stage was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: Miguel Poveda’s one who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at “La puerta open”; and the one of Professor Matilde Coral, who had exceptionally well wanted to cooperate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she agreed to play a role in my work, and that honors me.”
The stage was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, who was considered as a companion.
This work also relates in some way the life of this woman who exhibited itself in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also all over Europe, as she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think these women have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and appreciates their work,” Bayón said.
The show will start at 20:30 at Vega Lope Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a Recent Married Poet" concludes the Triennat
The first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a New Married Poet" in St. Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalousie for their Nobel Prize for the anniversary of 2008 for the celebration of the "Juan Triennate Zenobia".
In this way, the "Zenobia Triennate and Juan Ramón" arrives at its end with the reeditation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and the itinerary exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This population of light" which was inaugurated last May and then will be International, which will, after traveling to the various provinces with Con and York.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America Likes Less Without Paul Newman
"Once God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it.”
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ass of Malice", and illustrates well the despair of the American film, and of all America, faced with the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He was worth getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
This was a hard hit for everyone.
“Sometimes what a person feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better thanks to his existence.”
No one was afraid to become ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland has died during a particularly obscure period, where terrorists and stock markets fear, the estimate of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it remains to human beings only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It incarnated for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his elderly deceased after an overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country that was hard to impose on a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration broke Hollywood without paying attention to neither nationalities nor passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the summit of his career.
The poor boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, had nominated Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us the high bar," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to perish the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from objectives.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful even if his chances were not missing for not to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a bifteck in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
“Among all the major roles he interpreted, he has never been as proud of the devoted husband, the loving father, the careful grandfather and philanthropist,” he said.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympics race
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the 2012 Olympics, after the failure, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we’re not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've never participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be subject to an eliminatory note.
But let’s look at it in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of chests, which oblige you to go there in advance.
It’s not bad, but if they make you move it would be better to give you everything (including the e-racing gun).
And well, no.
They made you go there just to take the doll (first mistake, just move for that) and (after a long waiting line) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the shirt (second error, because I need a XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy small size shirts with less fabric and less expensive?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that you need to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting thread is 15 minutes and, in addition, you need to leave your bag at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these courses.
Since there was a long waiting line, the competitions started and we had not yet left our bag at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and attacks took place from the barcade.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be included in the classification with the exact time, because of the kidney that they gave me, which, I think, did not mark the departure correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite a perfect race example, that wouldn’t come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the Microsoft MIT’s Conference on Emerging Technologies, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of carrying out some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move to a company’s campus.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this “receptionist” can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including remembering what posts they occupy - and listening to and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she is not part of the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks her if she is here to visit someone and she tells her that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressionant.
But of course, this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change in Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have so many related programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not ceased to add features and "extra" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Many people have just emphasized that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for computing hardware and software to understand each other.
It takes the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your grandmother.
That's true.
It will never disappear but you must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system but are increasingly paying attention to the Internet browser.
The computer is only fired to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serve half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain less apps, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, monthly, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they will eventually become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a post requests them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft’s employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come out at the beginning of 2009 but at the end of 2009 or see it in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But since the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endossed him on the coast of Azur, Leonardo di Caprio carried him in the 'Blood Diamant' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the 'Francis Ford Coppola 'Parrain' and was part of the association of muscled gays.
And if we set out to list all of his appearances, we could also cite this moustachu side that lifted weights in an ambulant circle.
It’s not just a simple male body shirt made of cotton, moulding and without sleeves.
The English is called "tank", but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels is distinguished among others.
First of all, by his flaming name - although he is known as ' Marcel' - which has to do with sport as he takes the name, according to legend, boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' is distinguished from others by its excellent cotton, its united cutting, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (to be recognized) that the most known body shirts have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand produces not only top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirts, retro boxers, cachemire cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of the underwear.
Even if it is unfortunate to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry about me."
His enormous similarity with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Sisters Cruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and famous girls who borrow their name.
She was present at the promotion that the brand Mango made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion prizes the Spanish home sponsored.
Monica is warm and timid.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-hiver season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, waiting for us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 60s enchants us and inspires us a lot for our collections.
I love walking in town and watching women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and drawer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but at the end of time everything comes together and these activities have a lot of things in common.
Since I was very young, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look at my aunt’s wardrobes and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the entertainment park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing myself.
Dancers love to dress very well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel well.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes, you are actually putting yourself in the skin of the character at that moment.
Suddenly, everything is linked.
You haven't been 30 years ago: has it been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and taste life with less problems.
Biological watches don't scare me.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl, and that has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So you think you're becoming a mother?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise it with love.
Let's go to the movie, you're expecting the different movies you played last year.
It's true, I'm hoping they'll get out.
I'm a woman out of the theatre, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I'm waiting for the movies 'The Last Time' and 'In Search for the tomb of Christ'.
To see what you'll think about...
A few days ago, you started on the gate with Naomi Campbell, right?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the doorway to make the mannequin.
Just, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her for a long time, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her women’s support association and clothing we’re exhibiting – I’ve exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were sold at auctions to collect money for Naomi’s NGO.
The people that Naomi is a person in the heart of tenderness.
They say so many things about her, I know, many things are not true.
In addition, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to move for such a noble cause, but if she had to ask me to make it poir, I would have done it anyway.
The most important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Driving alcohol recurrents will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Interior Minister wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholics to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from being drunk, or if it does not breathe.
The initiative has already been announced in June last month and it appears now in the State Minister's report in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its aim is to re-insert the driver by offering him road recovery courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety and the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers arrested for driving more than once in a drunk state, the car resumed.
The alcohol would avoid this because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol level in the valve and prevents the vehicle from launching if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver’s alcohol level is higher than the authorized.
Its cost exceeds €1,000 and is loaded by the driver.
In this regard, a 2007 US study showed that vehicles equipped with this device decreased infringements by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
This measure applies only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be made by ordinary means, but criminal reform requires a reform of organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental form.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17:40, the official scheduled time indicates that the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias travelled landed in the Hangar Presidency Airport of Benito Juárez of Mexico DF.
The sun was at night to fall asleep, but its rays were still forced to put his hand as a visionary to be able to see the royal couple descending from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver if he knew the Spanish princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Oh, well, we can't just go to the airport to take guests at this time... are you here or then...?
No, no, no, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the journey.
They are several to wait in the airport’s hangar near the red tape and a military line consisting of 27 naval soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very much and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm threatened.
They make a brief stop with photographers before going to the room where the official courtyard is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they reside, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigolo journalist in Mexico’s television is waiting for them.
The most prestigious prize in fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good living drawer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded for a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango glass at the 54th Housesmann boulevard in Paris and she was almost crying with emotion.
Certes is the second largest brand store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1.335 square meters of surface.
The first store is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank stylist Valentino, chairman of the jury of the competition, made us come to a luxury dinner at the Garnier Paris Opera.
With the nearby table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having great hearts and doing good hearts against bad fortune, due to the recent death of his brother, Nati put a Mango dress and a few ELAH bowls, who cut the breath, and arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man nearly two metres high - accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared.
Andik, Mango’s owner, a gallant man, as well as the Rotchil Baron, ended the evening without dress because they had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who introduced himself to the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who metamorphosed for dinner by endoding a long, sexy and black dress, embraced when during the nighttime visit of the opera, she was accompanied by Goya Toledo, she reminded us of the bar of the time, they showed us the room of the goods and the goods of the dance.
Inés Sastre did not stay for visiting the palace dependencies, but she showed us in advance on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we enjoyed seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man moving on a bike – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his clothes, his towels and asked in advance that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress name
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to cure the whole, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the libraries on September 30.
The awakening-season almost attracts us when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse when we think of the rhythm of agitation that imposes our current life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But well, 1001, not one more or less.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole menu of methods adapted to everybody’s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the libraries directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquillity in places such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not shorten into your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit in the sofa, unconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talk in sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I am not talking to those who awaken very awake by telling us something that happened before, but to children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it can surprise you, but in fact it doesn’t matter.
It is a beneficent alteration of sleep called sleep.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely there are more than one who talks about it overnight.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadically (one time in life associated with a severe fever), or more periodically (all days, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no unique cause that determines its appearance.
They are often associated with other changes in sleep, such as cauchemars, night terrors, night enuries (make pigs in bed) or sleepimbulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever, stress situations or overexcitation.
However, it is an unthinkable phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or vice versa with crying, crying, long speeches.
In the event that sleepyness becomes very common, it would be reasonable to observe the child and consult a specialist, to verify whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to obtain an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benevolent alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with an apnea of sleep or stress).
What can be done is taking into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, search for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With children very nervous and hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them relax inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful Tips
Don't wake him up.
It is unnecessary because it is unconscious and you would wake it up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and therefore rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don’t hesitate to ask him for information.
You will not get anything, because as you sleep, he is not conscious of being able to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, suddenly pay attention to how you will interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even by joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Finally, don’t worry, it’s nothing good bad, it’s a episode that only takes a few minutes.
Icelandic... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory on its ground after a long period of disketch.
Without making a big match, the Yellow and Blacks created the greatest number of occasions and managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The rhythm was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann, who flew the lucarnate on a remote shooting, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascending and touring a slightly remote Fonderflick, and then with Hirn above, Roman of the foot or Diebold came to chatuer the defense of Dannemaria.
On the other hand, we were blocked in the middle of the field and just left the Riahi remount at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time would be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to take back a repoussed ball on a first Diebold attempt (53').
But the Illhousiens bowler will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to regain the clothes for a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital infirmity.
But Dannemarie will not be able to enjoy it and will not have great problems with a 11-housian who just pulled a little back to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game, where, after a big headquarters, the ball was passing very close to the crossroads.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a turn through Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of the force of fishermen who have severely disturbed access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to welcome it "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that it would come with concrete proposals.
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by the British fishermen to obtain measures against the flight of gas prices, which reached a record of over EUR 1.14 per liter.
According to Elysee’s spokesman David Martinon, President will “debate with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses find competitiveness and ensure the employment and salary conditions.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they carried out scargot operations in the Morbihan and the Calvados, causing roughly 10 kilometers of bubbles.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Isle were not stopped.
A filtering barrage was launched on the precipitation of the island of Quiberon.
The sailors have already shown their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic façade and the Manche, such as the Sands of Olonne, in Vendéu, where the chalutters remained in quai, or in Havre, where twenty ships blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped the block of the important refinery Total of Donges in the evening.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the Ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday the suites to give to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "the fishermen will not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, currently pay about 50 centimeters per liter, but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a ship is only reached with a gasoline below 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman The Great
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Robert Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes greeted the legend of the film and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft table on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats that are planning on the global economy.
The fourth global airline manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 shipment aircraft, said Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes greatly from the Chinese market, especially for its airplanes from the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider sending more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have inflicted, plans to ced more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion advanced, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper cites sources close to the dossier.
AIG’s Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine possible cesions, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing subsidiary, its 59% share in Transatlantic Holdings residing and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decisions have been made on these concessions, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay the 85 billion loan that the Federal Reserve has allowed him to risk the U.S. authorities to take 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in due proportion.
Paris History of the Morning Meeting Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused of a historical fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a never-looking loss nearing 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) scored 777.68 points at 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in his history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resuming of exchanges after the 11 September terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq Index, the technological dominant, scored 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the Standard & Poor's Index expanded 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1.106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street fell down after the unexpected rejection of the House of Representatives of the bank rescue plan, which would allow a little stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 votes for, representatives denied to the Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans have rejected their plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, seeing Congress unable to adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial said.
"This shows how much the market counted on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will not arrive "too late".
“If the project is actually moribond... then the relais will be transferred quickly to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would stricter credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, CEO of Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the sense of emergency, "any day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, said Piegza.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, causing emergency interventions to the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland, and Germany, signaling that markets are facing “not only an American crisis, but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The obligatory market has risen strongly.
The 10-year-old Treasury’s profit decreased to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on night.
Obama wins at the points of the first TV duel
In the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates followed another to find out who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
Without surprise, Republican and Democratic campaign QGs have proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, although honourable, has not been “brilliant” enough to allow him to uncover his decline in the five-week presidential surveys.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advance (49 percent against 44% McCain), believes that it is the Democrat who pulled out his angle of the game.
In the uncertain voters, who count, Obama was a winner for 39% of the surveys, while 25% of them awarded McCain victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the expected performance of his colistist, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake of underestiming.
She has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventh-year-old McCain has been constantly pushing up his undeniable foreign policy experience, while emphasising his opponent's "naïveness" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"The senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
“I don’t believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said he would represent the future.
Without demo, it proved to be concise and accurate.
He has advanced his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still hasn't understood, while Obama said this weekend, a Democratic spot reproaching the Republican that he didn't take the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the Street".
"In the ninety-nine minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday, before 20,000 people's meetings for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rainfall.
He has not even pronounced the words "median class" or "workers." The financial breakthrough is clearly advantageous to Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive turnout," he estimated yesterday, influenced Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration representative, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” with Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would still be able to reduce the taxes by 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's suburbs, the Senate of Illinois also stated that the achievement of possible energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a 45 nuclear power plant by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates excluded questions about the $700 billion financial rescue plan ($470 billion) adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there was an election, did you?"
Young and opponents protested on Sunday evening at the main place of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met Sunday evening after the closing of the vote offices at the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no result had been announced yet, many young people had come to protest against President Alexander Loukachenko’s power: “The dictator, the resignation.”
Some admit that they have not even voted: "What good, because they will do what they want from my voice," a young man said.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good figure for foreign observers in order to recover language with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be their own by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been forced away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the depletion," said Iouri Potemkine, spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
“This is a cosmetic change,” said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and head of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is to count the voices, and at us is the executive power.
If parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parlimentary
But their entry into parliament can mean space for television, meetings in regions and bill proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is severely owed to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform, we risk to become a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the election.
It stressed that the participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the vote to all manipulations.
“You noticed that there was an election, you?” asked Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the voting offices.
And there will be at least five MPs of the opposition in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back on the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Election Committee welcome their success.
The Interview - The Blood Again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public’s confidence that had been seriously embroidered by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the Acquired Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada established a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, in order to highlight the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such disaster from happening.
While Judge Krever was late to postpone his report, some provinces then set up a committee aiming to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Québec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, only 38% of people still trusted the blood system in Quebec, the Dre Décary.
The situation was desperate.
With efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground for the following years, we have regained public confidence,” she said before proudly affirming that nearly 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Hema-Québec at the beginning of 2008.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that “confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
At that time, many cases of the human form of cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were attended in Europe since its founding in 1998.
“And we didn’t know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, that when unknown and a serious disease can result from it, the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is characterized by a brain degeneration inevitablely leads to death, is to impose exceptional measures.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
But a few years ago, he was proved out of doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the principle of caution that was applied had meaning.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TAN) that allow the presence of the virus itself to detect directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have been able to shorten the mute period, which extends between the time the person has been infected and the time the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowing and unable to detect them.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people has the risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think we can feel comfortable today to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health,” said the head of the Head of Headquarters of Hema-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen is going to appear in the system.
Not later than last year on the island of the Reunion appeared the Chikungunya virus, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect into the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary said before emphasising that in addition to a security supply, Héma-Québec should also provide adequate supply.
“Necessities increase because the population is ageing.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donors network, which is an average of only 3% of eligible Québecs for blood donation."
However, any healthy person aged 18 years and older who meets the eligibility criteria may give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is severe, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them up and encourage them to become a regular donor.
“Today’s life being so exhausted, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving his blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone graffons, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only cord blood bank in Quebec.
The ombilical cordon that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood in stem cells that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of our millennium blood sample, and it is expected to take more than a thousand per year.
We should start offering it for greeps at the beginning of next year,” says Dre Décary, who describes this cordon blood sampling program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed by not being able to access them," because Héma-Québec has no means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-final
Montréal's Impact has qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first eliminatory series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 total goals) victory on the expense of Seattle's Sounders, yesterday, at the second and decisive match of the final series in total goals, at Stade Saputo.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After the first half without purpose on the one hand and on the other, the midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other networks of Montreal training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first round-to-back series game, Impact had suffered a defeat of 2-1 at the Starfire Complex, Tukwila, in Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunder scored a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 half-final round in total.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - But Victory of Kovalev
Canada’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win from Canada in front of the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this gain, the fourth Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory marking the only goal of the gun.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another match to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first period,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the match.
I've got a beautiful ovasion."
Charest placed on the north
Prime Minister does not exclude from launching elections until the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party was completed, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Québec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to make elections in the occasion of today's partial election.
"Return the boundaries of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in large lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Levis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a sort of Moulin was projected to pictures.
They turned in boucle, on three immense screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric bars, mining exploitation, Quebec viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means, such as during the election period.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would launch elections this autumn, even though he noted his timetable was very loaded.
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, the one of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the north territory to the 49th parallel - had never been subject to a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister bored to explain why the North was "a huge potential jewel", but did not give time to investment, amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few roads to what could be further developed: including hydroelectricity, forest, but mostly the mining sector, led by the growth of emerging countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's list.
This "territory twice as large as France", "it is home to us, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as well as to show that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold road in Abitibi, the Quebec engineer, the James Bay.
"It's to us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatre break to consider the huge card behind him.
North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press point.
“It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity is present, I repeat this position on behalf of the government," he said.
"With climate change, we need to re-establish our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage of the northwest, which will open up all year round due to the flood of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-pequist MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place of work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give a common vision".
North development would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerned, ordered and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded it.
“As the liberals that preceded us, we thought differently to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to the party’s head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebaptize the Beauharnois Central in the Adélard-Godbout Barrage.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the quiet revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made the Bay James, our party was able to forge the future," Jean Charest said.
In a press point, he invoked another, conservative reference, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
By addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper’s hydro-electric barge project, Charest emphasized that its launch was scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his militants, causing food applause at home.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not deprive the possibility of launching a voting this autumn, which allows him by law.
He stressed, however, that his timeline was completed, in particular, by a mission of the Federal Council in China and a summit in Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the weekend provided to the Liberal Chief a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which have passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ requires in particular recognition of the "Quebec specificity" in the Constitution.
He also wishes that Quebec appoints members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they have a veto right on decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the major lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
Pequist leader Pauline Marois outlined North-Du-Québec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, declined to apply it.
If he had done this, "we would be more advanced today," Ms. Marois commented alongside his candidate at Jean-Talon (screw that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just a show," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, who is returning for a holiday today, Mario Dumont.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
This is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (or irony) at Harper’s cabinet, who allowed Louise Arbour to say last summer she was a “shame” for Canada.
So throw the opposition to this woman who has led an incessant struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration as long as he says about the surroundings of the Prime Minister as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all Western countries involved, to have not repatriated his prisoner in the concentration camp of Guantánamo.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts he was reproached.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its word and leaves a child-soldier to crush in inhuman conditions.
The only one who puts himself back to a parodie of justice to evaluate the accused's guilt.
Remind us, for memory, that UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Canadian Barreau Association, in particular, apply for the return of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it doesn't matter if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of excuses.
We are still not aware of this, but we are currently attending an indiscriminate erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy”, the word that Harper no longer brands and sounds so cruel in his mouth.
This is the time when there is no more morality: you can mislead, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good wish of a government leader until this minority (which will then be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has abandoned what made our country’s reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, she is here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's orwellien speech
In his edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President Director of Canadian Minerary Barrick Gold.
According to Orwell’s logic, the world’s largest golden company has attempted to pursue a fame of six million against three authors and a small editorial house without the sound of it in order to launch a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they consider, especially in the case of prosecution in diffamation, but the law.
Without a surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
No matter the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the Black Canada Book will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and fight against an army of lawyers supported by almost without the mining pockets.
In these inequalities, however, the tactic is often to ruin the defenders in order to impose a solution to the friendly, which will bail the opposition in addition to fearing anyone who will dare to rebuild the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion she should have presented her vision of facts.
Unlike what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally conducted by the exchange of ideas and not by the matrix strikes.
Hence, it was sufficient for the miner to open his books, records, and to establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and funding of independent research teams that could have made light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and rejected the back of the hand petitions and support letters to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can at the same time ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word only means heavy-paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does that first of all because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, not as part of what many see as a balloon prosecution (as a result of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just put a stop in the place of the authors of Black Canada to stop the term using).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's prosecution is a direct attack on university research freedom and search for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denied, in blockade, the right to citation of credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent even the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that differ from the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under repeated prosecutions, who would be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment in which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's distorted prosecution clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she does not want a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to set up devices limiting such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans are listening
The Bush administration and Congress heads, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been running Wall Street for months has still been entering the two Chambers of Congress.
It provides, inter alia, for better control by the elected members of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the public money undertaken, new provisions to contain the number of houses incurred for lack of payment, as well as a right to look at wages paid to the managers of rescue companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We’ve made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush’s representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done in a way to bring back the real economy and the ordinary Americans from the current crisis in Wall Street," the Democrat said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on American daily life will be huge,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours by fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on the mood of investors.
The limit time agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election have proved rather favourable to the agreement, not yet expressing their dissatisfaction that we were forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has assigned the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that to allow owners to keep their homes and that on the salary of the heads of companies rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked on another chain to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes."
“The great lines I’ve read show that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with the money of taxpayers doubtful, risk-free and unselling claims from U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the crash of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage credits (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and creating a liquidity ice and ban on bankruptcy.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had taken over the first agreement project last week.
It is believed to have been out of this impasse since Democrats have accepted that some "toxic" assets of difficult companies are only insured by the government, rather than purchasing.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to take losses for five years with this programme, it could set up new taxes aimed at helping him recover his position.
The new plan envisages the payment of a first 250 billion tranche, which will be able to add 100 billion more if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be entered by another Congress vote.
In exchange for his aid, Washington will get shares in rescue companies that will earn him dividend in case of profit and that he will be able to sell back when the torture is passed.
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings for housing related to real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and starting compensation paid to the managers of the affected enterprises.
The architects of the plan would like to see him being submitted by the House of Representatives today, and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is still unsure that their plan will have green fire.
In fact, voices continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican camp and in the Democratic camp.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” said Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s Financial Committee, to his voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it’s not the benefit of taxpayers.”
An animator of a small group at Congress called "the Sceptic Caucasus", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent professors of economy, of which three Nobel Prize, wrote to us to say that Congress is asked not to press and carefully examine the way to take,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had resigned from acquiring its competitor in full-ship since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion U.S.) in the risk loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty-largest European banks and ten-largest insurers.
“It’s not lost money,” said the Dutch Minister for Finance, Wouter Bos.
In exchange, a vote right is recovered in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savings and households enjoy now that time is uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Manche, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank deprived of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would regain all current loans at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (US75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was her who would buy the UK’s affiliates and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, which the British government should nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty in the eyes of the blue has long been his asset card, from whom everyone will say his weakness.
Was he released from the Narcissical Mirror, the American actor in a charming smile?
Yes and no.
Its power, sensitivity, and a talent that flows from the source will also take him away from the power record that brings forth true sacred monsters.
What a great background racer!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, after a lung cancer in his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the latest icons of the American cinema of fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, which he looked like and for a long time was a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the enlightenment of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
Of these European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
Without demeasured ego, ultimate quality brand.
Because he projected an entire country of self-made man, fighter of the Pacific War, wounded to fight, who studied drama art in Yale in the early 1950s, and then attended the New York's actor's Studio, before winning theatre, television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who militated for civil rights was also the car driver who classified himself second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They also separate the shadow zones of this secret, discrete, engaged star, allergic to the show-business scratches, of which you will not completely perceive the enigma.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance took the films to the twist this weekend, while his major roles were in shock on the black screen of memories.
More than a half-century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation, it passes through it.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Nearer to us (1990), he is mentioned his sensitive Mr. Bridge, worried in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
There are so many other Paul Newman who have gone to history.
This rocky graziano boxer, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role dedicated to James Dean, recaptured after his death, who really released Newman in 1956.
This sympathy in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Amer billard player and revenge in Robert Rossen's magnificent Hustler (1961), he will recapture his character on the return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which was worth his unique Oscar on nine nominations in 1987.
That face through ages was him.
He's again.
The eras move through its path.
Young people know him mostly through the Slap Shot cult of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With the last role of the Irish mafia in the Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the bubble was bubbled.
Unlike several legends from the cinema that released the profession quite early, Newman will remain in the sea for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, his bears, his fasts and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "as a challenge living in the underplaying, judging his performances too supportive."
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long fallen all cooked in the beck.
However, he played less often young first than marginals: neuroses, alcoholics, salads or desperate, whose perfect traits reflect derivatives and rebels.
As a director, Newman reveals poorly known facets of his true pudilic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (from the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, traced a fine female melancholy portrait.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of power and sadness.
Among the rainfall of honors yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former army companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generality, love of existence are vibrant characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, a large civil rights militant, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood derivatives is also deleted.
Many have seen his binary throne on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of bad taste, although gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to his childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be engaged to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing the phrases: "Always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so brilliant and generous.
Citizen model, in sum and up.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company in their invoice factory?
On October 8th, the hearings on the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his comrades.
The politician and his companions are accused of scrolling, in the form of criminal organization, constantly and regularly, causing particularly significant damage, and other charges have been held against them, such as false and misuse of false accusations.
According to the parquet, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false bills.
The money of the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, was on the one hand in the boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to affect the amount of subsidies obtained by issue of expense bills, behind which no real service was provided, and thus the associations never respected their commitments.
According to the accusation, a large portion of the bills were false.
For the latter, they were purchasing bills on the Jósefváros market, while they were making the hills in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would be listed on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours to the province of the North Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, on request of János Zuschlag.
According to the deposition of the latter, he had to detect pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for a bill, on the model of which they were making the other bills they would introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the bills were created by István Lados and his companion András Őri, who, according to our information, was particularly concerned with writing the documents necessary to obtain grants.
During a "repeating circuit," one of the choices of Lados was a bistro.
According to the two bills issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, the site provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will subsequently be named by Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért, grew out of form and background errors.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned hundred and thirty guests.
The invoice emitters of excessive imagination also fell in excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor the Hoppá appeared, according to the information given in the park.
Győző Farkas, the company’s manager, told website hvg.hu that when the parquet called him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: “Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, hundreds of people were staying there also did not collapse, because this facility counts only eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Invoices issuers did not also look at Budapest’s travel agencies as part of their choice, but only organizing travel abroad, so naively they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be settled in cash, which is also contrary to the agency’s accounting practices.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services relating to travel activities, the destination of which is located outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, as the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. In addition, the staff of the hotel only issue printed invoices, while the fake was made.
The survey of the park showed that the "emistors" also made mistakes in mentioning as the provision of road transportation of goods, that the invoice issuer company could not perform, as its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for vices of shapes, such as inadequate invoices and false caches, that the invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of the 21st Századi Kulturális Associationet and Biztos Bridge have proven to be false.
Like in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó sporting stage, which both refuse to be the authors of the bills issued on their behalf.
Fakeholders also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time when (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, for this reason the company’s liquidator refused to issue this invoice.
Determined invoices
Another category of invoices issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictional invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, established a bill in the order of the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the prosecution, the manager of Collab Kft. was led to issue false bills by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, the company has cooperated with the Zuschlags, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices in the order of the Foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but none of which was effective.
No financial movement took place, as the bills issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies had avoided mentioning it in their accounting.
The next category of invoicing companies is that of companies directly linked to the accused.
Thus, the CEO of Delta Trió Kft., who operates the fuel and motor vehicles trade, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices regarding the sale of computer equipment, for about HUF 18 million.
According to the survey, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. company in Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have provided documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he embarked on their counter-value.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian apples created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were working, what the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He was still serving these companies, as at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, accused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The park believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into the pocket of Kubatov.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictional invoices that were used as part of the Bitos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció et Szöfeség for Modern Hungary introduced a grant application to the public utility agency of the socialist party, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for a double amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes set out in the application.
To prevent this from being known, five fictional invoices received from Works Team Kft. have been presented to the TMA.
In addition, these bills were found during the search at the Arpád Kemecsei office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report the method of making invoices, as she had previously done in front of the parquet.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to raise the veil throughout history.
Until now, his ancestors are not very detailed, and although he promised to tell the smallest details several times, he hasn't done it yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or then, possibly, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a large portion of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would carry the hat alone.
Today, the latter is likely to be vexed, as the requests for his placement in supervised residence, based on a relief of his detention conditions, are constantly falling into the ear of a dirt.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the authors of unreparable economic crimes, are free or at least waiting for their own home to end the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of the surencher: why is more money spent?
When selling at auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in Neurology and Economy at the University of New York managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings don’t want to be distant during this kind of competition, such as an eBay auction, and that’s why they even prefer to pay a too high price.
These researches have tried to set up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" with the help of experimental auction sales.
One of the volunteer groups played the lotto, while the other group participated in a sales at the game auctions, while with the help of a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), the researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could earn money, but during the sale of auctions whose essential element is the surrender of a third, the whole set being under the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensely during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise of prices is explained by the escape in front of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, economics members of this research group continued financial monitoring analysis.
During these three groups, three groups faced a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product concerned, and thus they carried out their introduction.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were going out of the game, then they would receive additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received him these 15 dollars before the auctions, the members of the group also lost that money in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed at one on victory, while at the other on failure.
By so proving the hypothesis of neurologs, players' team members were willing to "confront failure" bets higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena found in auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade at risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by creating, now, a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
About half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that the patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary are a hundred miles away, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is due to the fact that often the patients do not know they are carrying the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Liver and yellow inflammation are characteristic, but pathogenic agents and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, salt).
For travellers, it is highly recommended to vaccinate against A and B viruses. There is no C vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming contaminated foods, generally accompanied by a poor general state, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowness, the seeds become brighter and the urine takes a darker color. Cure may take two to three weeks.
Every year around the world, one million people die from the most severe form of this pathology, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus, because the pathogenic gene destroys the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people with blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis are counted worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is recommended to consult your doctor treating as soon as observation of unknown origin symptoms.
The disease can be healed if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
The 30th of September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the sick in the four corners of the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to the chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, to the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would work as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more tolerable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers at Oxford University made an interesting experience by analyzing the level of belief in God could influence human pain tolerance.
As part of this experience for the least strange, 12 Catholic believers and so many athletes were subjected to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a palpation technique of the human brain, we also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the control of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, to which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from various sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experience takes place as follows: an instrument emitting screws and diffusing electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look back on two paints, one by being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other by the hermione painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the beginning of this experience hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary mentions some kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci painting, not very different from the first, had on its calming effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during this time, received 20 electrochocs in four successive parts, while looking at either religious painting or the more general theme.
The Catholics said, in view of Virgin Mary, they felt like “safe,” like someone whose “care” they were “calmed, and peace invaded them.”
In view of the painting of religious thematics, they found 12% of pain less than when they looked at Leonard’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, thinks that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in the Athens, provided that we find the appropriate photo.
“We should find an image faced with which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, bishop of England, welcomed the results of these researches.
"Faith's practice should change and in many cases actually change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of knowing what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if the believers show a Madone painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the view of a Virgin Mary of better quality result in better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself
At the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that we can find it at the bottom of the pocket of people like the sky above their head. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their centres of interest.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell’s horror vision, they just do not see the essential web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to collect even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google’s founders to meet their initial goal that sounded as follows: “Let’s collect all information in a system in the world!”
According to the surveyed Google leader, after ten years of a global change work, they are only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all information.
The question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What work would I do best?". However, software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simply at first glance, that the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then viewed by the stakeholders are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can see what they searched, on what they clicked. Thanks to this, long-term Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give our previous logic-based reporting many more personalized answers, and will submit products to us
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? asks users, who are concerned about seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not the remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly the rebellion against power that can cause a counter-reaction in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the searched terms are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transferred to a third party, and in such a legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most relentless example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Internet users concerned about the rights of a person were able to push a relief in May last, when Google, armed below with the EFF legal protection agency, proved its right to the court before the FBI. According to the judgment issued in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the FBI's elements of the constitution, which may be required to disclose information on the late.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully gained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that he had won compared to strengthening the child protection law, voted several years earlier. But at the end of the account, he failed to provide the search lists of private users, neither the full list of these two last-word sites and the last two-words.
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is frightened by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their intimate sphere and private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion that is manifested against the multinational proudly-conservative companies.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its “swimming” gathering the passionate, computer activists and enthusiastic users that appear in many countries in Google see the next generation of major companies, the “connected corporation” in opposition to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as a world invader due to Windows, and even if both, it is bass.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not request identification code to its users, does not require money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible effect, younger and cooler, facing the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very accurately the problematic relationship between the rights of the person and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword in recent years, draws right behind him.
In fact, web 2.0 does not concern anything but collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and we serve communication channels placed at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to an automatic tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
While you can get to know many examples, such as the girlfriend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the night with, or the company who released one of her employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that this one wrote on his blog is a full-time renowning thing.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how we can define the principle hidden behind the behavior of today’s young people.
Someone wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to turn around the Google monopoly, can do it (by starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search engine, but at the same time, not deliberately leaving any traces).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not less. Google online services, through text processing to image processing, to day reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not more commonly connected to servers.
The public opinion expects, without really hiding it, the moment Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is more worth than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the revenue of many advertising agencies, while many computer providers create only, but the performances introduced to more and more important Microsoft programs.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all of this, contradictions with an alarming effect: for example, the company's top management refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the company's motherhood and after China's 2006 trade-offs, after China's trade-offs, all Chinese trade-offs so too expensive, as China's trade-offs, so as Google's take them at any time.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What's about, in the coming months and years, they're going to make the world move on new points. While some people think that the medical system scanning and archiving is the system, we're going to take so important sizes from Google's books and magazines, and we're going to make a lot of business.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-ton orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a fairy tale only through Google data.
Two minors helped to get rid of Ózd's double murder
"The police called two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double murder of Ózd. According to founded suspicions, they helped to make the traces of the crime disappear," said the spokeswoman of the Borsod department.
Youths have recognized the facts that they have reproached; for now they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungary Telegraph Agency) are young girls, are defending themselves free.
The complicity of murder may lead to a detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old young man, was temporaryly detained on Sunday.
The charges held against him are multiple murders, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, the 23-year-old man owes a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn’t want to dealt with his debt and that’s why he’s going to attract his creditor on Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the young girl of this 9-year-old man.
According to information from the ITI, the young man has premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes in the place of the crime is evidence.
Police examine the weapon and circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Varsovia Securities Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech krones, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Securities Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made although the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the stock exchange of Warsaw is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wants to separate from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech economic journal E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made to date for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the stakeholders, the new stock exchange in Warsaw would be the best owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 to 10 billion Czech krones by market experts.
Based on an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The main owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with about 25 percent of shares, followed by the 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the European press view
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, which are getting worse from day to day, the European press leaders already mention a "second 11 September".
"The overall financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. President," La Repubblica accuses Rome. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised by va-vite, aiming to bring help to a desperate situation."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as warren Buffett evoked, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
A portion of the Madrilene press also sees the issuer bow in Washington.
According to the vision of El Mundo, these are the shortcomings of the political leadership there that led the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system rises every day, and then the whole world will pay the price.
Bush’s plan was far from being perfect, however, after the Congress vote, a real danger threatening, that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The global economy goes into the vacuum, just at the time when, in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat can not be ignored longer, the Geneva Dailys-Anzeiger said.
Some states may still have a savings bump to their titubating financial institutions, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks fall asleep like dominoes, then neither financial nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need that the states of the European Union do little in case of their national egoism, and that they centralize control over divided financial markets.
Not only on Monday, weakened financial institutions have received more than €100 billion, the Vienna newspaper Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hand in the pocket, very deep, similar to Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU hasn't really been busy with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent in part.
The “switchers” shouldn’t have to trade 100 billion euros immediately, however it would be reasonable if they noticed in what case it would be reasonable to affect taxpayers’ money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car imitates the burdon
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an obstacle detector already exists in nature?
Like, for example, the bees.
In the incredible project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, bore bees gave Nissan’s engineers the strategic start idea to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini-robot car, a bio-inspired BR23C self-robot control system, which has equipped the quality of bees, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
When flying, each bees forms its own, oval-shaped space, which in fact looks much like our secure protective cock, Kazuhhiro Doi, director of the Department of Research and Development and Public Relations of the brand, explained at the exhibition.
The bees' face eye plays a major role, as it is able to see in all directions, in a angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the face eye, engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the board microprocessor, which transforms it into avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second, then the mini auto robot, imitating the bees movements, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t so, the mini-robot couldn’t react fast enough to avoid the obstacle,” Toshiyuki Andoh, director of Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project said.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective cover, a layer where the collision is currently considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bees do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in an eyeliner.
In contrast to the bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonal, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotating movement, acceleration as well as slowing as manoeuvres available to the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and the energy concentration is larger, making their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is essential, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few signals incoming per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of previous manoeuvres, so it only uses dozens of kilo-octets of memory continuously.
We don't need memory of a giga-octet capacity, or even mega-octet.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant avoidance technology. According to Nissan’s estimates, this system will enter the series cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its path.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying suspicious loans from banks, and to be used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during new debates extending up to midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on controversies that have existed for days and days, around the total saving plan of $700 billion.
“We have made a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, whose agreements remain on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however, other measures must still be implemented. According to Pelosi, here it is not a question of rescue from Wall Street, but to turn the roads of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 20:00, local time of Washington (i.e. Monday at 2:00 in the morning, according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular increase in the scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote the bill in response to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act.
Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight, and we greatly appreciate both parties’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
In addition, the program diverged from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of securities on suspicious loans.
Then, up to half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the law was adopted by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will serve the secretary to the Treasury to buy doubtful bank claims, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the Chairman's disc.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
According to the law, the secretariat at the Treasury will be able to establish a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to buy doubtful claims, securities on doubtful mortgage and mortgage, as well as other types of “toxic” claims.
The officials of the Ministry said that purchases can take place as part of a auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the secretariat of the Treasury guarantees the tools that cause concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the predictable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provided the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast purchase of suspicious claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system resulting in the collapse of one important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank leaders who are in bad positions and awaiting State aid can expect their starting compensation, simply called over-the-Atlantic gold parachute, to be covered by the government.
The ceiling of wages is only mentioned in very specific cases, and the limitations depend on the way the secretariat of the Treasury offers its aid to the company.
The principle of ceiling means that if the secretariat at the Treasury purchases as part of a auction, they will take a golden parachute tax surplus unless the bank president discredited retirees.
Right after buying doubtful claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not excessive.
In order to complete the image, it is necessary to add that existing golden parachutes are not modified; the ceiling applies only to new contracts, which thus motivates participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceiling will be in force with regard to the appointments of directors-generals, the Chairman of the Committee on Financial Performances of the House of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, the State is entitled to acquiring shares in banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and the saved banks with it fall back on their feet.
The draft law indicates that within the next five years, the Chairman must present to Congress a proposal to resolve how losses will be refunded to taxpayers from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why American citizens ordered us, this does not protect the dollar from taxpayers,” California’s Republican Deputy Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same ones who press the action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will we need a visa next year to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are good chances for the U.S.-Hungarian visa exemption agreement to enter into force by 12 January. That is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, in front of the local Hungarian community leaders.
“Now, everything depends only on the moment when the out-Atlantic electronic entry and control systems will be launched.”
Every time, she draws attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be negotiating from today in Washington.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will return the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Star of the Order of the Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisers of candidates to the Presidency, Barack Obama Democrat and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support both the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support for the $700 billion government rescue plan, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the U.S. secretary to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congress representatives and the Administration finally announced Sunday afternoon that they had concluded basic bank rescue agreements.
This funding plan, aimed at the emergence of the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the main issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain show themselves, each as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama again managed to acquire a little bit in advance. McCain's advance, achieved with Sarah Palin's nomination as a colist just after the Republican convention, founded.
During a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope to see Congress voting the 700 billion rescue law quickly.
He emphasized that the proposal contains consumer protection passages as he also supports.
“It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger to your work, your economies, whole industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy,” he said in a crowd of 35,000 people.
He failed to qualify for McCain's economic ideas of over-the-counter.
In an interview with the ABC channel, McCain said: “We will all have trouble sharing it (...) but nothing to do is not a way possible.”
The Republican Senator said that the proposal mentioned the establishment of a Treasury Control Committee and the ceiling of the departure compensation of the senior leaders, and that it was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a role at the bottom in negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the secretary at the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, Chairman of the House of Representatives, said Sunday there are serious hopes that the House will vote for the bill by Monday.
The Press Revision of the German Language Territory
The right camp is intact, it’s only in the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - that’s how it mentions the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent coalition of red and black.
The Mirror ( mirror.de)
In the German Left Information Magazine’s Internet edition, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled “The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers.”
According to this recognized polyloge, the CSU erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took his role.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now the same modern citizens are turning their backs.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore the problem of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but Sunday, a process that was likely to end, just ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of the National Party was completed.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU grew up with 47.7 percent, this for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the Stoiber.
The cause may be due to the modernisation of "divorcing his parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
For 40 years sociologists have announced this, but they have been seriously mistaken about the rhythm. However, secularization, the results of the education and establishment of Germans from the north and east of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain unconsequent on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization will be in parallel with the increase in opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more entitled.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, just the groups of classical citizens who have been quite far away from the CSU, such as independents, craftsmen, bachelor holders and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU’s support has decreased by less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With Who? With Who? The presidents of the party stand on the reserve to the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian newspaper takes care of the confused domestic policy situation that was established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interchangeing with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ Populist Party is open to negotiations, and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything turns around the coalition; during public television debates, party leaders barely have to let their cards go.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ President, confirmed that he wanted to talk to ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is actually possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, remains open by Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer responded carefully to the proposals of the Reds.
As he already said, a collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann attempts to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or entry into the coalition is at the moment an entirely open question, which must definitely be discussed within the OVP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
“To avoid coalition of red and black, we are ready to take over government responsibilities,” Haider said.
Járóka said: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equality of Chances has begun in Paris, whose host is France, as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In its message presented before the Plenary Assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, attracted attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that most successfully affects their children in life and one of the main
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Chances Equality.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultations are European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civilian bodies, in the field of equality of chances.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Party Populaire group, Járóka warned that, in addition to the distinctions found during employment, Romas disappear from the labour market, first of all, due to their low qualification.
“A devastating majority of young Romans do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of a poor-quality elementary education, only a poor part has the opportunity to obtain a degree of higher education.”
Furthermore, Járóka insisted on the fact that education as a basic human rights plays a key role in the exercise of other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roman children means strengthening the economy of the EU member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to be aware of these reports in the broadest possible circle, also between the Romans and non-Romans.
In fact, the sooner a Roman child starts school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"From their nationality of the European Union, the Romans must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality education and sectoral education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the Deputy, a collaboration of the European Union towards a goal and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools, for which compliance with existing and preparatory anti-discrimination directives is of primary importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, separation and unemployment; it is necessary to give the opportunities provided by democracy to the children of Rome, so that they can participate as citizens of full rights in the future of Europe," Járóka said.
On behalf of the European Year for Equality of Chances for All, the goal of the European Summit for Equality of Chances organised each year since last year's summit in Berlin is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken for equality of chances and to combat discrimination, targeted at the European level and Member States.
CSU: Thanks for a transitional period
In October, the decision will be made on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein Duo.
Despite this pityful election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the discussion on personal issues at the Bavarian summits has been updated.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress, held last weekend in October.
Members of this very critical couple, in any case, feel that they are not particularly in their headquarters.
Thanks to this, they used to calm up the angry members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" required personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, yet under Edmund Stoiber's leadership, at the top of his career - the social-Christian union won 60.7 per cent, while today, a year after putch against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU has been Bavarian's "unique sovereign" giving 18 percent of German GDP.
However, the conservatives are always strong in this southern region, key to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, presented as possible successor to Huber, also received a position in this modest recognition group, which initiates discussions on tatons with the FDP liberals, as well as the EVO's Liberes, with the EVO's Liberes
A strange nose foot of the destiny was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose measurement against Stroiber was used as a possibility of putsch carried out by the Huber-Beckstein duo, to subsequently treat the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, CSU leaders put their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far drawn the figs into the coulisses, will also receive an active role. The former regional government chief and former president of the CSU, appointed on September 28 as the most affectionate day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber released some close comments to the CDU, according to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be Chancellor if they resumed in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, CSU's land loss will not negatively affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will always last.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6% in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - six rivals : 110 - 0
No deputy of the opposition entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, who ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegals committed during the votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation consisting of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been very well in opposition for many decades before yesterday's elections, the opposition unifying its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would seriously hope that this presence will be a few times out of 2006, resuming its presidential mandate for the fourth time in the elections.
In this way, the ODSZ resigned its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarus political order qualified as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-placed politicians do not receive importation so much of the company owner of nature leads to entry, so trans has always taken the gas to the cause of entry, was one of the expectations of the opposition, Belarus
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than deficiencies, such as the prohibition of presenting itself for one-third of opposition candidates, refers to a prior relaxation.
However, the OECD’s Monday statement already contested the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present during the votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize Southern Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia paper.
“We have made two steps forward, and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has been abolished,” said Alexander Milinkevitch to our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remains like this, although "the power has been afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to make even one opponent enter."
The opposition does not provide for protests on the basis of the results, but rather seeks to communicate its message on the need for economic reforms among voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we must print our opponent newspapers in Russia, local authorities put wheels on us for what is spread, but I can also find that they are increasingly supporting official elections, even in the circle of the elderly as appropriate social security, even considering it as relevant, even in the current circle of the elderly, which Lutrahen is more than referring to the regime," Milkevitch said.
“Due to the country’s debt and the rise in commercial deficit, the collapse of social security, ‘voking the silence of a cemetery’, is just a matter of time,” Milinkevitch said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have qualified for democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, the leader of the mission of the Independent States Community, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in acts." In this way, the absence of opposition is only evidence of the matureness of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “From today, breakfast before work.”
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, we had rotating doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the little ones, against whom it goes and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during the working hours.
The anti-speaking news has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
“The turning doors,” says Brunetta, “is a tool for working better, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” said the minister.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's reformism," Brunetta further stressed.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, “the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General says: "This is a process shared by employees, and we have all worked together."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the High School of Public Administration
“In three months, public employees’ absences of disease have decreased by 50%, or 60 million workers in more than a year.”
And it adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
“The salary dynamics,” the Minister explained, “the last 8-10 years have doubled in comparison to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined together to contest the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today reports data on the decline in absentity at work due to disease," the Association of Consumers-the People of the Active" continues to increase.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees have gathered to declare war to the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar is contested the exclusion of additional allocations in the event of infirmities due to service; the prolongation of the timetables for the permanent residence of the sick worker, during which inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Creditious Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, Inail data confirms that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause nearly twice as many deaths as murders.
To have the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Labour Accidents, which was institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The alarming data published by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at work,” said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Works, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its sincere appreciation for the continuing association efforts to promote the prevention of workplaces, the protection of accidental workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion.
"Naturally indignified, everyone has struck to put an end to such tragedy that, by their dimension, stimulates the crying of the media and the participation of the public opinion, although daily reality presents us dramatic, even repeated cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are particularly important for a more direct awareness of young people who enter the world of work.
It is our duty, keeping attention to this phenomenon, not under evaluation of the alert on social gravity, applying and improving legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini emphasized how much "this phenomenon of white dead constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults each of us' conscience, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data from the accidents on the work appears to be a slightly positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive yet,” said the president of the company, Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this “debate tendency” to actually lead to a lesser attention, because that’s just when the attention is relaxed, the tragedy is happening.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done thanks to multiple actions."
“We believe Mercandelli has emphasized that more inspections and inspections are needed, as well as an important intervention on the training of workers, and this from school.”
He added: “There is still a need to be made for communication and awareness of public opinion.
“But above all, we need a greater sense of the responsibilities of employers faced with a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the planned compensation for the victims of work" and the "assistance derivative to which the system has been targeted in recent years."
“The goal is, therefore, to return the insurance guarantee to the worker so that the fate of the one having an accident should not depend on spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislator.”
The Mp3 player on the finger is at risk of hearing.
Listening to full-volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission announces, which in a communication published in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unpredictable and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“The scientific report reads in the note that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable music devices for more than an hour a day and a week, risk permanent hearing loss.”
“I’m worried that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile phones and mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable manner,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“ According to the scientific data, the EU official continues to be a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information of public domains.
We also need to review existing control systems in view of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intense use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise.
"Scientists conclude that the EU executive confirms that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other stakeholders what measures may be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against similar noise exposure from mobile music devices.
There is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but concerns rise about hearing damage that could result in excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data well using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
The U.S. Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits of maximum noise permitted at work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods risk permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This interests 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano ordered to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we will start, in March we will end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Thermes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official headquarters" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it should emphasize Germano - it should propose ideas of development of Rome, which will be used by political decision-makers, which remain the Committee and the Community Council.
No supervision of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June, the Mayor will present the strategic plan of the work made by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Commission Attali, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is accelerated by daily management and emergencys that are manifested from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see from the forward, and further, to a deeper prospective, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future."
“This Commission is not an unnecessary organization or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the Roman citizens a euro, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences expressing the Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "there is a strategic, not farmed or immovable benchmark to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit."
A future that, according to the Mayor of Rome, “will not limit itself to the usual communal borders, but who will look further” not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capitale, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.”
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous American politician who is going to be independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on his side, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
The attacks on Obama increase as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really stunned: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that counts at all, two governors and five black senators."
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; these are of course racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will it be a good president? We have also surveys, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the southern U.S. throat, wrote an article: once in the vote cabin, we know who the American patriot will give his vote.
This is where an aspect of American mentality remains secret until the end.
“Tell us what you want, we will see ourselves putting the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things have never been revealed so far, to the extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was returned to her home by foot strikes.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives, and Americans have not been forced to make the bags.
Nevertheless, Iraq was mostly Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge point to accomplish.
The U.S., the economic outbreak even makes it feel among journalists: in the press, it's time for removal. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interpelled by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not expressed openly to the attached information, feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like before.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
In addition, deletions carried out in the newsroom, in the room where editors work in the assembly of newspapers, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if we wish that traditional journalism, such as the large audience, is not significantly reduced.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press newspapers are convinced that national journalism is following a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have nothing to do with seeing where the web is going.
The biggest editorial houses fear a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" in the paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to joining technology hoping it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the largest acronym in American journalism resides among those who lead the newsrooms – i.e., directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of the directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to “work security”.
Directors who think to lose their job within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As for journalists, we get 30%.
The one of "safe work" at staff level (us editors, ndr) in America is always on agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive high wages, while the editor can earn $10 miles a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payment.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days all, a number of years spent.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
This is the fault of climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE AND GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankers as part of the Unipol-Bnl scale instructions.
During the trial on his charge, last week, he had obtained home release transformed into mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the province city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such moves (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already occurred a few days ago, with the House of Representatives vote, contrary to the $700 billion saving plan approved by the White House: a lot of significant Americans were, and yet, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the U.S. economy.
And well, yesterday’s New York Times confirms that the current crisis shares the Republican Party, even more shared between its last soul East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions as well as the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to those of Washington and the Southern and the world of finance, mostly in the state’s power.
The soul, just, that made itself depotically with the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is just an example of changes, major changes that the economic earthquake is ongoing or already lets run: not only in the United States, but in the whole of the West, and can only be here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been blown for some time, so that in the new climate they are solidifying and showing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary renewal, of the double-sovereign state category, compared to a kind of renewal of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that, of course, have close relations with foreigners, but which, above all, are largely involved in the balances of people and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it governs: to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis emerges globally, but politically, it is almost only national here.
Political internationalization seems to be really out of play, or not, has much to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, is shared between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot be decided on a common policy line.
And so, the Government of each State is waiting for interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit affection: when we pass through a difficult period, there are only States possessing economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to rebuild things.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of an invaluable value, elements of which no international market or organization will ever be available in a similar manner.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis remains perfectly in harmony with the ever greater importance that the recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a rather linked factor to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxally, while we were now convinced of entering the kingdom of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to deal with it as little as our material, with more and more petrol.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but that are absolutely linked to a circumcised space, to a territory.
So, he who is sovereign has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has evil to live in a place without harvest, without oil, without water.
I now get to the second newness that, however, provides a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
At one point, the consciousness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leadership, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And in addition, something deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distantness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
This further increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elites until now, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have at the same time, and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeding undergroundly, a powerful and ramified movement of delegations of the leading classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised "revolts" elections, or, in the changes of the collective mood of these latter Americans could be right-wing victory, from the Conservative rise of the country's right-wing rise in Austria, Bavilion
It feels that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have always more difficulty, which is not today, to understand and therefore represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is increasing and the potentially enhancing.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda, it seems frankly excessive.
But it is said well, keeping your eyes open, this is not without reason.
The supercolle to walk over the walls.
Win the laws of gravity thanks to a super collar and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measured only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to maintain a body of 100 kilograms wrapped on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the research team, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the stick can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti battery." explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hair that allow the animal to ensure a perfect adhesive.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it’s easily separated from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –”this material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” added Liming Dai.
Can it be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since the carbon nano tubes are heat and electric current drivers.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to searching for a new adherence.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented a microfiber-shaped adhesive, such as hair, which self-cleans dust during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Attention to pamplemous juice, orange and apple.
These beverages, especially consumed in the summer because deslayers and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter the amplifier or decreased absorption, as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether they are, in spite or fresh, associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway risking some health effects in Philadelphia, he starts a new warning, taking a glass of juices and drinking a glass of juices.
Pamplemous juice has already been strongly criticized as it has been responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytic, staminal and neurological anti-staminal drugs, up to toxic levels.
The Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warned doctors and patients not to underestimate the risk of this mixture and to take care of what you are drinking, if you take medicines such as Diazépam or Métha.
According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by pamplemouss and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacy at the Public University of Milan, said: “These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always worth reading the illustration papers of the medicines you are taking, and, if something isn't clear, do not make yourself impressive, but speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," Ansa said.
The Nobel Prize for Economy by Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Kenyanesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that has chained many controversies, and which has been reproached to the economist for years, but which has now proved accurate.
“I’m a little surprised and even shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron’s collapse or Worldcom disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a very aggressive stylist, particularly critical to the excess of liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open-source personal productivity suite that aims to touch more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a one-year work done by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is displayed to the public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the reviewed and less outstanding interface, to other important ones, such as the standard compatibility for the latest Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the new ISO Format O support.
Open Office has particularly focused on the interaction with the Office 2007 sequence, and it is actually possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting, certain features specific to certain modules, such as those that help reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, e.g., to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphical processing module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a computing sheet or a text developer.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has made various improvements within applications: in the calculation sheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on modifications, in the development of texts, as each employee is awarded a color of comments for better recognition in the phase of revision.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is dischargeable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and has been added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the following is, as usual, available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or at workplace.
And if the theme of freedom can be a way to broadcast it in homes, it is just in the business, that Open Office continues to try the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Without counting on the realities that provide training, consulting and assistance services, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writing, for Word’s equivalent video writing; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint rival presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Goal for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive, it is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best jumper shirt.
This is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe reporting the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the Third Generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, they too from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests performed on Kohl tests are part of those performed in recent weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analyses confirm positive in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positiveness to the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who reported to the Associated Press, having notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, raising the shirt for the best climbing.
IMmigrants: New York Times Is Asked If Italy Is Racist?
Italy "as long as immigrant countries recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with retention.
This is what the New York Times discussed a long article on the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originating in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a cake of biscuits.
This case emphasizes what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": North regions are both those in which we record" more integration and more work", but also "a strongest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the most important support for the North Lega".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new Lega legislature to stop immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal people is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
"Giorgio Napolitano in his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal asked the State and Church to work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of expensive rentals, up to €900 for a room.
The student rental market does not know about crisis
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the leasers' trade unions, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding all categories of young people, from the right to study due to the very high global costs that the families of origin have to support," explains the director of the study office of Sunia itself, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand of love for students' processes has so deformed
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free, unregistered contracts, unlimited lease, subloans.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the taxation are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from a minimum of 650 euros (Bande Nere zone), to an average of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, one bed costs on average 350/400 euros, one room around 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students focus in areas near the University, it takes €250/280 for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), there are about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 euros for a single in the Predestina area, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, it is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you need to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, are recorded a subsequent abnormality: the rental requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Bye, old cinema Paradiso, cities embrace the historic rooms.
Historical cinema rooms close to the Multiplex.
"A city without movie rooms is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The picture offered by the scenerier Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provinces,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multi-salles, and the death of the consumption of monorooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seem to us inevitable and incontestable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical and memorable places, "as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of path and so much emotion" observes the scenery of the Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, film lost in the way to live, which can still be a film that offers no way to live to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and a poll of the Grand Prix.
The figures provided by Anec, the main merchants association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that have paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, 9 in Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is headed with 82 lost monoroom cinemas, followed by Toscane (44) and Lombardia (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the occurrence of the multiplex, as these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-sale films: 195 additional screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Toscane and Emilia-Romania.
"The Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a firm room in a city, these participants are not necessarily willing to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the lack of credit deals for traders: the previous State debt is about €10 million.
It is a shame that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Let’s take note of the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Majority and Anec, the first of these kinds in Italy, to defend and promote mono-rooms of historical and peripheral centers.
Among the proposed regulations, there are tax facility measures for managers and benefits for the public in mobility: viewers will be able to enter the limited traffic zone, and will have special fees for parking and in certain parking spaces.
“This is a initiative that I like,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologne by implementing other measures.
However, it is obvious that to counter the super power of multiplexs, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closing of Bagheria’s Super Cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the insight that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had thought about for 10 years.
I’ve lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I’m going through the Rialto, or the Quirinal de Via Nazionale, now closed, where I’ve had so much shared emotions, I’m turning from the other side so I don’t see the noise panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested by Mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniform the choices of the Mayor in the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
Heavi accusations are launched by the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabre, against the Mayor and Vice-Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The manettes for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little son, the boss’ homonym, already convicted for association of mafia criminals, as well as paying 10 million euros.
“A confrontation with legal and moral regulations, and especially with good sense,” the prosecutors wrote, both local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"That would have been granted to the clan to officially enter the Mayors by facilitating the possibilities, already substantial, of public administration control and guidance."
The President of the Regional Committee Agazio Loiero, not only hides "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in its region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in other places, where the collapse is almost inevitable."
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure ofndrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests of this morning followed those of July last, following which police announced that the Piromalli clan had deported.
From the end of April last, Gioia Tauro’s municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their office to manage the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a right-centre coalition, after the ballotation of May 2006.
He shouted to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at that time Marco Minniti, who accused him of having maniacated everything for a political issue, but because of the request of prison signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Departing of ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm writers, emerges "the readiness to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born of waves, bigs are now launching.
This is a demeasured rise that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, streams, marries, here are the new renewable sources on which Colosses like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for now hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices fell, around 1980, the idea of exploitation of marine energy was laid down, but now environmental instances and new oil rise give the sector a great rise.
The World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity need could be covered by seafood operating systems.
This amount would be double the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and marrows.
Colosses to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, who signed an agreement in 2005 to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would say a real revolutionary step.
At two years of this, more and more candidates among these companies have always been devoted to traditional energy in marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” said the spokesperson of an American oil colossal company in the Wall Street Journal Economic Journal, and evaluates the possibilities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate authorisation by the U.S. Energy Commission necessary for the implementation of a marine energy operation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, the United States continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has launched a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the sea energy path, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are not known, according to observers, are increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about technology still at its beginnings, the fact that marine energy does not distort fears about the environmental impact.
Currently, systems such as Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a big problem with the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, we need to use technologies with higher environmental impact.
“And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boiling system connected to each other.
The wavelength, which makes the bows move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
Pressure turns a turbine that, in turn, feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the coast through the sea submarine cables.
For the moment, we have four such systems in phase of project, waiting for a single federal approval and some of the energy could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking lot using six turbines under the navals of the East River of New York.
The motion of water during the seas, turns the turbines pales, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that he has a long list of customers waiting for permissions to get energy.
After the waves, the marijuana.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, which now deserves the potential of the Marines.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, marrow is more predictable of wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is just about sea energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, have invested 7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and plans to invest up to 35 million in 2009.
