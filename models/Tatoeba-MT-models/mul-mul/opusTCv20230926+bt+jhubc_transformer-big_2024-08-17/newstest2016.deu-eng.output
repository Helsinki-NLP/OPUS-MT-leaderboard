Obama accepts Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as the destabilizing measures of Tehran in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stressed for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement building of Israel and challenges Netanyahu’s lack of will in the peace process.
The deal that Obama promoted on the Iranian nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship of the two.
In March, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech on the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, which was partially considered an opponent against Obama.
The speech was not negotiated with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel in his time.
In an emergency call, Professor says he has shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "cute dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the deceased woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note, which was crippled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could do it back, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was in the letter according to the authorities, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb had made the emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: the Lamb took his life when the police invaded him.
One day after the shooting at the university, students and teachers were forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get an image of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators on both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were pleased with his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "written people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose bodies included 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a reception for health reasons and said he had a health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the University’s employment policy meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not give him any guarantee for a automatic way to hire as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are the questions the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lambs' track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber pistol at the back of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the edge of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running at the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He promoted in the spring in pedagogy.
One of Lambs' long-time friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and the Lamb was 20 when she met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool old man who tried to teach her the guitar game for years.
He was the woman's hot at that time.
All the girls swallow up when he was there,” Hairston, now 40, said, and live in the Jackson Prefecture of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstone house, who frightened a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-wife Shawn O'Steen said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but friends were left and had a daughter now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about her daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared in a summer-year market three years ago.
Later, they played the one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly enlightened bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at the night 5 September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmony game before a spectacular audience.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
“It’s just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning and joking together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the deceased professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American urin residents and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community attended a candlelight memory celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache, while the University School "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lesson will be restarted on Wednesday.
“We try to move our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that the Lamb in his emergency call described Prentiss as his wife, but there is no evidence that the two were ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set up less workforce for Christmas time
Toys R Us says it will not set up as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toys and baby products dealer says he will give the current employees and season workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to set up 40,000 people in stores and sales centres across the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to equip shops with employees that sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox laughs about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and I gradually understand that Princess Diana will sit next to me,” he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary film Back in Time.
The film begins, and I think that I am a simulated gap and a arm length away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had a 30-year premiere.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "uncontroversially the biggest time travel film ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said his response to Russia’s strengthened military support for Syria was that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and poverty for millions of people.
The UN Head again urges all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to join and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council – the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France – at the edge of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation irresolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they proved in dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 Surveys that show that Donald Trump is taking seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others made him a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranges in surveys down, it hasn’t worked yet.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leads in the two-digital area, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mole.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one claims Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Perrys was led by the rising Herman Cain, none of which won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he should fight in a general election.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economy Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s perseverance and begin to let their dollars flow to crash him.
Here are some current surveys that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity values have rotated by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his appointment in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two in ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
Six in 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP speakers would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67% of the Republicans said they would either be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "angry" if he'd be the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiasm" vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
The next about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "infuriated" if Jeb Bush, the favourite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombing and offensive statements, 52 percent of the Republican voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies to the nation's first pre-elected state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent believe that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not pass into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When they set up their tuition guards, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who actually won the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This has been a change since four out of ten in late July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full Revelation: GOP brokers did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28 percent for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it appears that a variety of GOP exchangers consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gather for another candidate, Trump strikes almost everyone.
Some experts suggest that the dispersed field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-trump support is distributed diffusely to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey from Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump gained majority support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points, and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who hit him?
Ben Carson would overcome the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they have given their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change it, and no one can really say never change your mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump’s strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico two months ago in his election peace, immigration was a turning point and fishing point in the 2016 public discussion.
Some are worried that Trump’s decisive Hispanic American bombing will be kept away from the Republican party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So, as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, Donald Trump will seem to do it.
The frustration over the government rises to new high levels.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support of Republican voters, particularly through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey by ABC/Post, they would rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated about the Republicans in the Congress, with 54% "unsatisfied" and 21% "happily angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residents of Germany
Here on the Hobooken road is the most expensive residential facility - overlooking the North Seawatt.
On the street, a square meter of a reet roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," the study says - therefore the high price.
A new study shows which special layers cost a square meter the most.
Of course, €18.70 per square meter for a student offer in Munich are not really few.
Unlike Germany’s top homes, however, one of the prizes appears like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residences - with square meter prizes in swinging heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, well noted.
Well, who can get it...
In other words, Munich is not at the top.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double torch shooter in Piräus: Bavarian star Thomas Müller has just one race.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller hit the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3:0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then run's.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave the FC Bayern in the witch box of Piräus a dream start in the "Mission Milan".
The team of trainers Pep Guardiola won their start-up game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers Double Pack (52/90.+2) and Godtzes Treffer (89.) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start-up success in the series will be the first step towards final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to take the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
In his 28th match in the Champions League for the leadership of Bavaria, Müller received friendly support with the help of the Olympiakos Tower Roberto, who made a world champion's shot thought to be a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavarian captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at the Karaiskakis stadium before 31,688 hot fans - and the Munichers kept the word.
They showed a focused and committed idea without shining.
Piräus had won his latest six home games in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also broke out here (1:3).
However, the Bavarians, who did not win in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went boldly, but often in their offensive efforts, to be too unfairly done.
The attacks were initiated too often by game shifting on the left sides of Douglas Costa, which rarely passed against the former brown swinger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from right than his flank from the right half of the upper left door.
In the 67th minute, the world champions gave the possible 2:0.
The best occasions in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when the Olympiakos stormman Ideye Brown struck Poland's headball from the line (26.).
Then by direct reception, the Torwart Roberto compared to the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians took up their usual dominant game, Piraeus could put a needle stitch.
Manuel Neuer was departing.
For example, when he pushed a shot of idea over the latte (56.).
Beforewards, Guardiola made a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the frame, was first sitting outside.
The World Cup only gave green light after finishing training, sports manager Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else, that's already bad."
Also in the first exchange, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to the attacked Lewandowski (59).
The gods came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it clear 13 minutes later, Muller put another on by elfmeter.
Before the game, it came to Krawallen at the stadium.
After a smaller group of Bavarian fans in their viewer block seemed to have provoked the host Piraeus fans with words and gestures, the security forces took action and went with strikes against the Munich fans.
At least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke do not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth - this puts a long-term Potsdamer study closer.
The good news is that if you resign, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is based on a long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute of Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth was 2.5 to 3.6 times higher in smokers.
Scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the tooth meat, the DIfE stresses.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
Therefore, the link between smoking and loss of teeth goes back to more frequent toothpaste inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it may take more than ten years until the risk falls back to the level of non-smokers, said Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, study director Heiner Boeing from DIfE said: “Smoking shortens life.”
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, leads to good dental health until high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by dental insufficiency, the DIfE said.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early toothbrushes.
The new long-term study underscores the findings.
Archaeologists encounter Cologne Rheinufer on remains of the late
Repeatedly, archaeological findings have been made at the right rhinofer in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germany Museum have buried skeleton and remains of historical buildings, the museum manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Köln, the museum is always added as a facade for archaeological soil memorial care.
In the third building section of the Rheinboulevard, archaeologists were now completed.
From text documents, it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church have been established, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman of goods train
After a young woman has been defeated at Geilenkirchen-Linder Station, the Federal Police asks the people for help.
Early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the trail from the train station building coming at the end of the train staircase and was captured by a goods train coming from the direction of Munchengladbach.
By capturing the train, it has suffered the most serious injuries, according to the federal police.
She was treated notarically on site and brought to a hospital by rescue officers.
The founding officials have no findings about the reason for the nightly ice overcoming of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by Witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inhabitants or passengers of Linderer Railway, Ziegelbeckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Notifications about the cause of the accident can be provided by the Federal Police at the phone 0800/6888000 or any other police station, switched around the clock and free of charge.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to strengthen the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
Consequently, the controversial private settlement facilities for disputes between companies and States are to be resolved by a more transparent system, which corresponds to much more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to create a system that the citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said in the presentation.
Sweden has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiation position in free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU States and the United States together elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come from the same parts of the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
It would allow you to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings agreed with arbitrators, there was no possibility of objection to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long run, she wants to work at an International Investment Court.
There, for example, could be clarified disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The large-scale investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, by which companies can dispute damages to taxpayers, remove national laws or implement a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission has taken into account key points in the reform, which the Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel had developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European Business Europe Association warned to limit the possibilities of complaints in the economy through too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be detrimental, it said.
When negotiations about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been underway since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be already late this year.
This date is considered no longer durable.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Beyond him is a flipchart on which the shameful folk singer recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with a pencil.
The whole audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells from different places that he records on the map again and again, and reports his small and sharply organized songs.
Where they were and how it looks there, in their home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative mistake.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appear clever composed songs that are harmoniously close to American folks of the late sixties, but can operate greatly opulent at any time.
The rumor emerges that "Michigan" would be the first part of a deceased series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be consecutive.
However, in 2004 and near Rhine, “Seven Swans” have already appeared and breaks positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens is here.
Live enough guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invits You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), 2005 released a widely celebrated masterpiece.
Overbording with ideas and stylistic finesses.
The album goes into the US Billboard Charts and misses no yearly best list of influential music media.
After excessively productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic sales pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but is worn by programmed sequence or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Along the smaller clubs, the scene shows will be here as a colorful spectrum of neon star bands and large fluorescent scene decor.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens tours as part of a five-head band across Germany.
In the dark hamburger held More!
Theatre presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who became considerably mature, returns to intimity and folks.
Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
The audience hears that the lecture is "opulent" and that you can throw the "plate in essence".
Only for adding thanks to Stevens' modestness, sounds a few older songs and ultimately denies under a huge applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's questionnaire
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut is expected at the Prime Minister’s interrogation time with tension
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is going to give his debut at the Prime Minister's questionnaire and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six questions shortly after lunch, while his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour Members from nearby.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could jump over a few sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Anniversary on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Chairman’s decision on Tuesday during the celebration of the National Hymne at a 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is the center of several title-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn has drawn attention to
A spokesman from Mr. Corbyn said he had "stay in respectful silence" and recognized the "heldentum of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn’s Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the National Hymne "independently" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen Shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn’s top team, referring to differences in economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders.
The BBC’s political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stapel" within Labour, after Mr. Corbyn’s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour proposed changes in order to remove the entire idea of a total limitation.
Hours later Mr. Smith, Shadow Labour and Pension Minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was just against government plans to reduce the limitation of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he has been Tory Chief, faced over the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said the Prime Minister's question is too confrontative, and that he will stop both "slapability" and fighting with opponents, and instead committed himself to focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Minister of Economics, will represent him if he does not participate — for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also introduced the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the word, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the spokesman of the underhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to withdraw from politics in the style of a "Casperle Theatre", which is often associated with the Prime Minister's questionnaire, but a few years later he realized he failed.
As she was first broadcast on television in 1990, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometry of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the underhouse and his position among his colleagues, although critics have argued that she has become a caricature and needs extensive reforms.
Shots in Joburg: Homeless youth trained to photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a dirty place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and thus earn their living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a publicly profitable studio that teaches homeless youths how to take pictures of their surroundings and get a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose slowly according to data showing an increase in the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller target.
Between May and July, the result grew by 2.9% in the UK without bonuses compared to the same year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has provided estimates about the date of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and was climbed up to 0.84% compared to the euro to € 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 % to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the rival AB InBev received the purchase offer.
A transaction would combine the two largest browseries in the world and combine brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraged news from the Competition Group for Luxury Assets Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures defeat all expectations and also showed that the sales in China – a key market for Burberry – reiterated growth.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the Bergbauriese said he had taken $2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs put his estimate for the company’s rating on “sales”.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax score of 46.6 million for the half-year period.
The head of JD Sports said higher wages threatened the expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill said a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more buying power in pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchase force will compensate for the higher labor costs in its company, he says.
Costs could affect JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
21-year-old, a handmaid with overshadowed hair.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
The U17 is running through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7am in the morning, the polyns sit on the cold stone plates form Berliner luxury hotel am Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Buu: Here you live your Idol, whose posters hang up in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much a day as her mother Ewa deserves in half a month.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my Victoria should sit in the tenth class in the gym."
"I'll fulfil her a dream."
School obligation?
Who's fucking?
The fans aren't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's out there anyway.
For the advertisement in the Superbowl’s pause, he cast three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pixel company washed many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And for every puppy that looks like him and goes over the store table, Bieber also casts.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stand on the window sheet.
More than 100 million would have been used in this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasized that Bieber was finally in the United States and Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" at first place.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in many zeros for the first time.
At least he does that.
Pegida Plata brings Lebanese on potato-doner idea
Potatoes or potatoes?
Both are in the potato donner developed by Oldenburg’s Imbiss owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the spray "potato instead of Döner" on a plaque of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potato and meat together on a spice.
The idea brought him a post at a pegida demonstration entitled "Potatoes instead of Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, in his store, a barbecue is rotated with meat and potatoes.
“This is multicultural for the stomach,” Alhay says.
The Lebanese idea has now been enrolled at the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the Authority, it has been recently protected as a pattern of use.
How much meat and how much potatoes the spice contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Even with its customers, the culinary people’s understanding is good.
Metcash launches ground strength campaign to fight Aldi Infall
Metcash attempts to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi-surrounding in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food Wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil stability campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eish manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, distributing samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling licensed tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the wholesale of food, alcohol and equipment implements its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the game as nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores make up and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern countries.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notably provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries.
Nevertheless, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries for twelve months after opening its first markets, and will take away all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath by Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and Metcash lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and achieve a sale of $500 million and $600 million in every market.
The loss in the food and food store and the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed cost basis could cost about $13 million profits before interest and taxes, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern countries, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley claims that Metcash’s sales in food and food stores will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and the market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, lead fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But it is believed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and food trade, which provides approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time as the pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale returns and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products every week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to deliver a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s head of business, Ian Morrice, says that the pricing adjustments and store scanning programs will be added to Elan and hope that the wholesale will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the “collateral damages” in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and earns more praise, according to Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", has been invaded by Kyrgios' famous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fireworking qualification game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, shouting, "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen as he collapsed a tennis player after a crash defeated a potential US open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was permanently defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in single behind Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup half-final against the UK.
“One thing about which I am quite eager is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit involved in the fight,” Healy said.
He has broken a killer when he lost because of a crash in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player to break a killer from frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has acted extremely well in the U.S. Opens, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I believe he has been treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he is hard trained, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and more mature young man, and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra as a long-term fixed component to return to the team.
"We first wish the team to be fully focused on the competition and not all the controversial rounds," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has quickly managed to rise to what people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He has risen in public eyes, and he has committed some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to just get him the best for the consequences of his acts, and just understandable, and I can do it after some time.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees behind
Hungaria declared the emergency state and dropped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a country of no one and Serb officials responded with excitement.
The people who fled from violence stood in an unknown trail on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there for an unknown time.
But frustrations grew up.
When a police hub scrawled over them, the migrants scanned “Open the border!” and shouted misleads against the Hungarian ready-made police.
Some protested from food and water.
Serbian Foreign Minister said it was "inacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Turbulences at the Hungarian-Serb border came a day after the 28-Nation Block at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility of 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that an agreement would eventually - next month or until the end of the year - be reached to include additional 120,000 refugees, including some of them from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a European Union special summit to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent on Tuesday.
However, Hungary did not put his hopes on a long-term action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
The emergency situation in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a stall wire along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country after it has ended a stroke on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison prisons were used in the race to create the stack wire tray between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a significant passport and a point of entry into the European Union for many warriors from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a strongly unlike other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force around the middle of the night in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage to the 4 meters (13 feet) high bridge that the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime; these laws also lay down higher imprisonment penalties for convicted traders.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency state," government spokeswoman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
The parliament still needs to approve the use of the military, which is expected next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen hard-armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Advisor for Orban, said that the authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come over by harming the wrath, they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes in accordance with the new laws.
Authorities are in order to quickly repair the wheel.
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train train with stack wire arrived to close the borders.
Chaos crossed the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pushed a crowd to enter there.
About 20 people were able to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's Progress against Bernie Sanders in National Survey
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit progression in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent before), while Sanders stands in second place, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidency, receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the elections, most democratic voters say it’s too early to say their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more durable in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has earned some profits.
Clinton holds a big progression among women and moderates, but these progressions have decreased.
Their support for men has been significantly reduced, and Sanders is only back here with 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage in Democratic voters under the age of 50 has been fluctuated, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, has a major predecessor among the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit precursors in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point precursor in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the country’s pre-election say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
One quarter would support them with some reserves and another 15 percent would support them only because they are the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps it’s not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are mostly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those that currently don’t support Clinton – only about a quarter would support them with enthusiasm.
While 48 percent of the Democratic voters in the pre-election say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the belief that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval to deal with the problems and the selectionability is also cited.
As the Vice-President throws a potential for the President’s office into the Waaghall, 57 percent of the Democratic voters want to see him in the race – although a third believes he shouldn’t do it.
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Clinton’s followers say more than half that Biden would be their second choice far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to nominate Democrats, Hillary Clinton's predecessor is rising from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election; however, this number has declined by 78 percent last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that considers him as the "elective" has increased.
However, in the question of what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electionability.
Like last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these pre-elections is unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features in voters of the pre-election of their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best cut off in honesty with the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is the leader.
30 percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have any opinions about him.
Democratic voters of the pre-election generally also view Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server are still being asked as a Foreign Minister during the period, most Democratic voters are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions at all.
But it’s another story in the American public in general.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton’s general opinions, although 36 percent said their opinion had deteriorated.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by her party voters, this remains a problem for her registered voters in total: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not consider them a honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also consider Trump unfaithful and unreliable.
But Clinton and Trump get good notes in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are best cut off in honesty.
A majority of Sanders looks more honest than honest, but like Carson, many do not have any opinions about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-election is 6 percent points.
Ben Carson arrives close to Donald Trump in a country-wide survey
Ben Carson is close to the latest CBS News/New York Times survey behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half the support of voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatically stop
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country, with support growing by 23 percent in the last CBS survey held before Fox News debate last month, by 27 percent in the survey on Tuesday.
But Carson scored from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson welcomes demographic groups and Trump surpasses among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is rising in surveys - it lands with 19% support in Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side hips for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologised for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Comfortable bath temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Although top values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimmers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at up to 17 degrees.
Some are no longer going to the sea: maximum 18 degrees have the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
Bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Baruch College Newman
Almost two years after a student died during a spectacular ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng brutally during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, police reported.
Officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pounds backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then he died unconsciously.
The Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood members did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became unpowered and expected to wait an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the National President of Brotherhood, to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide outfits and found the welfare of brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected, and the next morning he died of his injuries.
According to an autopsie report, Deng was repeatedly added with stunning force injuries to head, rupture and upper shell.
"For many families have been destroyed by the Shikans of Brotherhood. At least one student dies at Shikans every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengs family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Twenty-three members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of shaken attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
“We don’t just want to be responsible for those involved, but if there is an organization that – officially or unofficially – has sanctioned this, we will also bring it to account,” Wagner said on a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has rejected its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
There is an increase in interest rates, and the houses will be defeated, revenues for loans will rise, and the economy will lead to a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
In particular, the history of the economy offers only small guidelines to the end.
A recession occurred within only 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions respond.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
Finally, however, market participants could find that the entire excitement due to interest rate increases may have been overwhelmed.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of “financial money,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. census to normal heights, but still too low to lead to the seismical shock that many seem to be afraid.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency that asset earnings will be slaughtered 12 to 24 months after the first rise, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," German bank analysts said in a recent study about what happens after interest rate rises of the Fed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the rise trend – about 14 percent – on the way to interest rate rise, rather flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal status after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a current analysis of Nusset’s management, Bob Doll published.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the rise cycle and the yields begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often promote them.
In the present case, the Fed is facing some conditions that could not have been before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is very important to note that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an increase in interest rates in the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter was 3.6 percent in 2015, few expect this to last and expect 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic cult could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been focused on an increase in interest rates in the Fed throughout the year, and all eyes were aimed at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trade indicates only a chance of 25 percent.
"In our study, all the rising cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing vibration in GDP and pre-recession increases very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this is clearly a slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is so far 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market is taking place in an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than in stocks when they change their strategic course.
In bonds, returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bonds fall immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer linkage of returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a deflation of the curve.
High interest liabilities often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are even careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more strict monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the revenue curve is flat, credit spans have expanded and volatility has risen - all the market characteristics when the Fed harness its strategy.
In general, companies that deal with most of their business activities in the United States will benefit from it when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will get worse because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also funding their debt.
"The story shows that "Quality" shares tend to react too positive three months after an initial interest rate rise," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded on average 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates increased in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital income and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pendants by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most,” Goldman said.
Outside the net stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see gains from higher yields, even if experts are different from how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says parliamentary member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for his "decomposition"
He argues that it is increasingly not distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, claims a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he does something that the private broadcasters do not.
Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also told BBC boss that the public-law radio broadcaster was "due" and increasingly not to be distinguished from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dump" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be just under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples in which you actually just imitate what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the charges and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn about classical music elsewhere.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment to finding new music from Radio 3, and to assign new works, I really think it's important too," he said.
Earlier this year, the BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder to work to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of the BBC production to be put on fire during the consultation in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports, in order to put commercial rivals on foot.
Tory Deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the BBC’s musical talent show purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in particular BBC wisdom".
He added that he wishes the company to find "a hit from our own stall" when the next time it starts a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or spend money on payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet bets increased slowly in August, and Black Friday may be responsible for it.
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the recordings in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November broke out the expenditure
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been boomed, and many of the UK’s main shopping streets have turned into spirit cities.
However, experts say there are now signs that online bets stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increases compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and fall down to 2000, then that has always evolved over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is going on, and we may experience that growth is reducing.
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the declining turnovers.
Experts believe that buyers will refrain from purchasing before this event, each of which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers cut around their computers to make their drops, and some traders’ websites fell down.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for snapshots, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British retail consortium found that from £5 spending was spent a little more than £1 online.
In some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now done via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried those killed in crash accident in Mecca - Bin Laden family is sanctified
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia partially puts the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the crash fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane fell in Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
The sad ones, largely dressed in white, filled the path to honor when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Freedom Cemetery.
The sadness process passed through the Holy Place, where only days before a Baukran fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the family Bin Laden for the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beasts who were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already confirmed that the Hadsch will continue to Mecca with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane if he was not used.
A Arabic version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said the Bin-Laden group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said the company’s leadership was prohibited from traveling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman praised to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane, which fell into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hadsch, which took place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements about the collapse of the Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also discussed the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of crowns are surrounded by Mekka's Grand Mosquee as part of the massive construction project, led by the Bin-Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a deceased son who was detained by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse of the crash came in the middle of strong winds and rains, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for pilgrimage travels, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stayed in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered 1 million Rial (£174,000) to pay to the relatives of the dead and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British are increasingly busy craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
This leads to the opening of 200 more screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales points across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is argued that British lower their hams and pinsels in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform the work in their homes.
If you can go with a hammer or a pinsel to reach walls, you appear to be a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employed craftsmen to carry out homework jobs in their homes, the company’s head behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a huge increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at the lowest price has now been over.
This is why Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q sales sites.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees are mostly men.
She said it is necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more female single homes that are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this further into a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are made up of women with 80% of decisions about the purchase of items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, one of only five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also reconstructed her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied 50 percent of the team with women, including his management and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profits and turnovers after the group declined the costs of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officers of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the Klagenfurt National Court on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Visa Aich/Dob had to be responsible for infidelity and tax indebtedness.
The accused were not guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse.
He was legally freed from this claim in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to High State Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the accused had been used for private purposes in the period 2006-2011 of the funds of association accounts for which they could have been available in their functions.
He charges the damage with about €400,000.
Athletes are also charged with financial offences.
This is the fact that the chairman of the creator’s Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin, was issued.
It should be negotiated at a later time.
To the claim of the infidelity, the defense suggested that the association had no asset disadvantage at any time.
The sports officers had only charged stress damages and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (brd 44,000 euros).
"Then we stood in front of the situation: are we going to continue the club or are we going to close?", one of the accused, in the big business auditor of the finance office, said.
With his colleagues and mythologists he then decided to take over this task.
With all risks.
“We proposed money to put our life insurance as security to the bank,” he said in the interview.
It has been agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, you can only make no debts.
Furthermore, in the case of financial success, the repayment of the compensation has been decided backward until 1991.
Therefore, part of the damage has been paid only years later, i.e. from the year 2003 when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, pauschal and not detail bookings also appeared, the former Obman explained the operations.
The accounts and savings books managed the two accused together, the second accused said.
Why the expenditure was not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in detail in financing, it is important that only debt freedom has been, according to the answer.
In 2011, when an official investigation against official abuse began, a sum of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the accused said.
This securities account went on the name of the second accused and was not known to the association, according to its statement.
“Why?” the judge wanted to know.
The questionnaire did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally thought that this would be the best for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The complainant was informed, the official justified.
This transfer was formulated as a "repair of damage".
Why the damages?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first accused said he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged.
But what shall I do if the lawyer says, "With him you are all out of the shadow?"
“Am I a lawyer?” he asked.
In addition, the officer said he had never paid a cent wage, he had only charged kilometre money and diets.
He charged the association with diets 1,000 euros a month, but the actual burden was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for early years could not be submitted by the accused.
They are no longer stored after an operational examination in which everything has been assessed correctly, they explained.
The second charged had also been charged with kilometres of money.
All corrections were made in a bar, so he had to travel from his place of residence international market to bank to Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on September 23 with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strikes 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year personal degradation, the computer rise will reduce further jobs in the split of the company.
The posts at Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
The U.S. technology company plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company customer department as part of its restructuring.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (2.4 billion) on Tuesday, the company said.
The step will lead to a special burden of about $2.7 billion, which will be affected by the fourth quarter.
The ongoing deduction of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
HP employed about 302,000 employees by the end of the financial year 2013/14.
The Hewlett-Packard share decreased 2.3%.
The larger companies from Palo Alto, California, are currently divided: The computer and printing business is to be assembled in a new society, separately from the more powerful areas of computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business parts are to be noted on the stock exchange.
A re-deceiver PC piece and a weaker demand for business customers for their services have recently added Lenovo to the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the sale of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5%.
The sale fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
This resulted in a decline in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split and massive job intakes.
The 76-year-old firm under Meg Whitman’s leadership has only been late in responding to customers boosting smartphones and tablets rather than conventional computers and making more and more shops online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans are expected to reduce approximately 55,000 jobs in total.
Conflict: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in combat actions in Iraq would mostly be denied: 54 percent spoke against, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states flying air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24 percent are opposed to interfere in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian power owner Baschar al-Assad rejects 51% of the respondents, 20% would be for this.
29 percent couldn’t decide.
Car: Second Press Day on the 66th IAA
The centre of the exhibition is networked, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press releases, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connect" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday to Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA Car Association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: Violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used hundreds of refugees settled at the Serbian border with Röszke Tränengas and waterfalls.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the eruption of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind the police had formed a line and behind the police was a waterboat.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, pieces and plastic bottles to the officials.
First, the officials used uncontinued pepper spray.
Then the police used tears.
Lots of tears were driven towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
Refugees have been withdrawn for a while.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone.
Children who breathed the tear gas cried.
Other refugees sackcloth together and breathe under nose.
The Serbian police spokesperson also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. banknote
The world observes when the U.S. notes bank meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make an important decision whether interest rates are raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half of the Fed's last week's opinion that the Fed would do this now thinks that the Fed will endure a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed’s interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Chief Executive Officer at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generates a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink view of global conditions.
She has warned the markets to adhere to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 p.m. on Thursday
Death killer at Delta State University leaves an apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it "leads" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unthinkable," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, Professor of Geography and Social Sciences at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency center employee that police had to send police to his home.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and he also mentioned that a “great dog” is in the house, but that “no one will disturb,” but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwriting note of Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb moved 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, when police surround him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite Monday reports, Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they had been married for about seven years as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
The police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He doesn't go to prison."
When the police picked him up on the highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb moved his car to the side, fled walking, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his life course on the University’s website.
Stars who lost their lucky bearers
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had a few stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor is also allegedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this certainly requires his tribe.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the company
Lufthansa plans a large company building.
Half billion euros per year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of the around 1,000 managers worldwide will cost the company’s construction workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the cheap Eurowings subsidiaries.
The aim of the reorientation is to contribute to a cost and income synergies of about €500 million per year, the airline reported on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will no longer be a board for the passenger business in the future at Lufthansa.
The low cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Board of Directors of Carsten Spohr.
The re-assignment highlights the importance of Eurowings that the company wants to play with Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000 employees of the strong company was complex.
The airlines firmed under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which amounts to three quarters of the annual turnover of €30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), negotiations will be restarted after the court-stop strike on Thursday.
That was what the union shared.
The topic of the talks is the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants "in a year with a predicted recording result" to reach sustainable results as soon as possible.
The conflict between trade unions and airline led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, the savings concept is "Wings".
It is planned that Lufthansa will expose the company’s low cost line Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League retreat at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this led the left outside defender to cry and will exclude him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by an unprecedented attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 years, it's very difficult and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
In the cabin, he had an oxygen mask.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an eleven meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had disturbed himself.
You can judge yourself if I say that an elf meter and a red card were worthwhile.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was, "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my way to recovery starts now, I'm coming back stronger."
Manchester United suffers Luke Shaw’s loss in the PSV defeat
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June with the European Championship in France.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a breach when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 Championship.
“He is very hard because it wasn’t his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear that it’s a very bad injury, that’s not good,” Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents will learn soon: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long until you know it almost outwardly.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When he was asked by a child care system provider to name his favourite child book, the Prime Minister of The Lorax, the 1971 environmental flag of Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Sweet, moving, creative, and with a powerful message, it is a book I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed before."
Everything beautiful and good, except the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, instead gives a content entitlement of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a true tree in 1991."
As if it were not yet suspicious enough: the text submitted by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and begins as follows: "In the overwhelming city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a good, hopes for a boy named Aunt the heart."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the act of the book. Here an unnamed boy, like the local environment, falling trees, thneed stretching once-ler, despite the protests of the naming Lorax, we'll say, "bearing in a hook, snoring,
It is most likely that such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who hasn't read The Lorax 20 times each other.
A Downing Street spokesman said that the text was probably from Cameron’s electoral district office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s employees but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England's team, but it's still hard
To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the frame chosen by England for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outer victory.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting performance, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear 2012 scars, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth separates from the England test frame and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to release Adam Lyth, of course, is difficult to analyze for me as his manager in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There was no questionnaire at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said this - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, Lyth's race would have been extended, but he had control over his own fate.
Hopefully, if he runs further for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his position, even though he did not make such good performances, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s mostly a teamman.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to put his signs is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had the chance to play at home and out.
The only claim to be raised was that England first employed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a striker I think.
He is an X-Factor Cricket Player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same chances as those before him, but this depends, of course, on the crew in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beside Cook suggests what would bring an extra spin bowler and get four quicks appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a striker can't beat there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil's screw of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealing with him he has very impressed me as a young man.
People may see his statistics - on average 31 with the shooter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spins that lift their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made a few smart supplements at the trainer staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test advisor could be a championship.
He is one of the best guys in the game that will bring a lot of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or coach, and how Mahela has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the clothing cabinet, even if the messages are in line with the previously stated.
Colly's team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not employed in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar pause against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and teammakers do not determine the schedule.
And you need to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with light hearts.
Brexit (Brexit = U.S. exit from the EU) could be gained if the economy falls into a flood by 2017
David Cameron's unexpected new negotiations strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be deeper in difficulty every day, even without the choice of the genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or TUC, which has severely disappeared because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat’s friend recently said that some Member States, so deeply involved in various crises, such as the EU is now and not always on their own guilt, have established the UK itself agenda with shared consents and disruptive contract amendments that they do not usually want to be satisfied.
In Brighton, the TUC at its annual assembly decided that it would not like them even if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win ally for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outside-looking UK within the EU tent - "Let's not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-term ministers and officials have come to some capitals to the point where it doesn't matter whether we stay or go.
Germany’s special Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened with overwhelming long endurance such as Thatcher (11 years), Middle Rand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a confusing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to break a leg to help the selfie brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s departure from the UK – something they don’t want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may intentionally even plan not to be helpful notes, especially in the SNP style, while the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The new negotiations were a pleite" and "The UK has gained nothing of value from the new negotiations."
The Europeans know how busy the Fleet Street can be at its expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barone, as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975 but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can weaken Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro-Opportunists who made a name as a "EU-Great Bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included Medley from tax-free scholarships, telephone hackers and the Pseudo non-Indians, who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similar to her, but noted that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cabin, you better distribute bananas to dive it off rather than to become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself than he opposed Cameron’s referendum, because Blair had put the principle on the unapproved EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a rear door to him.
The press has never given it to him.
But the cute Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly knap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time to miss me - appears to be in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch's 80's strategy, a mistake at that time and today.
It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but surely with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is in development - I think it is friendly.
He said we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional flushing trend and the wild fields of Torys Klein-Englishism may say yes.
It is what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and television this week when the router fought in him, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be ill to his labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary’s struggle was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his counterparts and deputy members after all reports on their statement on Monday night.
Whatever Corbyn’s touching bottom up image wants to provide – remember that he even touched me – news discipline remains important in the time of TV around the hour and, above all, in the strudel of social media, a breakthrough of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to hold Labour's support in the referendum campaign for self-comprehension, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic multi-deklarations about EU membership - in line with their Bennite settlement economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the Narcism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his multi-deklarations to NATO – Tom Watson is rocky convinced that JC does not start a campaign – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their heads at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital, - they also have misreliable voters - to make consent to the British if all this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in the Tory government in power, which I remembered at the start of Monday by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
A state-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their e-cigarettes report.
PHE published the "General Report" last month and described it as a "complete review of evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of the data and indicated the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical magazine Lancet last month addressed the "extraordinary wind base" on which the PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE’s claim that “the best current estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions to a synthesis on the damage of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were together in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had previously received British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e-cigarettes manufacturer, but not the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the Board are not delivered, but include several well-known e-cigarettes champions, some of which also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are unknown for their expertise in tobacco control.
The PHE tobacco management also took part in the session.
The research work of the group "is significantly lacking" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s allegations that “there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a way to smoke for children or non-smokers.”
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s allegations had already been responded earlier.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his need.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the unique obligation to inform the public about what the proof proves and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and the national health system costs £2 billion per year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former boss of Channel 4 says
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the radio fees should only be used to make the type of programs that are not transmitted by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-controversy time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters like BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 in his time.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC will order or send programs, which will also be clearly shown by unsubsidified rivals," Johnson told the High House Communications Committee in his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to hold the radio fees, which I don’t think for a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least produce on programs that others don’t do or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course crazy.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax program could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both of its own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this public television is going to be.
I don’t think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts give back what Sky's former director Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs should go to BBC4 where the audience can't be measured, but they can carry out their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify £4 billion radio fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson said to the Committee, “I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions for who can get the best value from this.
Of course, all of you think, we all think that you get a great value for £150 per year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me whether that is true because they don’t consume much of the BBC.
The former head of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also stated before the committee on Tuesday, urged the BBC to review its Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertainment".
He said that only few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it would be 1% of their television production and 0.1% on radio - and she should take an example of changing this in "informing, clarifying and entertainment" to public television broadcasters in Australia and Canada.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the proms, from which he said that only one handpiece will be displayed on television, and with the commercial broadcasters join alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are radiated with clamping pulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by eruptions of sound waves.
The small nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are radiated with clanging pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning into motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Read more about this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep heart stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulse into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Fiber swellings usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bladders, he discovered, strengthen the ultrasound waves that then penetrate the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves affect the opening of these ions channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms to wear some of their TRP-4-ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbells and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a breaking tool that allows scientists to turn off and turn off neurons with light pulses.
But Chalasani said Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass without impediment and thus be sent to the brain from above on the shell.
"We believe that with genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make targeted human neurons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torturers - right in front of your home door!
The ads shame the UK arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapon Message Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Breaking legs in jail!
Streubos!
And electric shocks that cause pain, but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and the cartoon pictures make no doubt that this announcement for the world’s largest arms show is a fighting parodie produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government’s willingness to light up repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains that require a second glance.
"An important announcement: Are you driving with the DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the fonts of the London Underground and the brand marks of the DLR line that turns into the image of a tanker.
In September, a swarm of arms traders will drive with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms show.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A group named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 package of input keys, claiming that "access to about a third of the bus stop surfaces on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parodie ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, Curator of Crueol Designs and Professor at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another anti-weapon trade plate welcomes the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which collaborates with the graphics and Voiceover artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapon fair - by an ExCeL calendar empty site - and thought, "We give them the campaign to try to avoid them."
They played with the invention of a more realistic, ambiguous company advertising, but "by inviting with bright colors and animation it remains more responsible."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to strengthen the consciousness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies by Amnesty.
What we need now is a breakthrough of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not illegally treated in front of our home door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapon show comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors shatter fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order of the U.S. Army on "the AT4CS RS fired from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped fighting head that delivers outstanding follow-up effects within the target."
Whatever it does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the excited smiles of those who have been angry with me - and the numerous long-sufficiency complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to student homes is from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It’s exciting to say: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you’ve taken the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you “really don’t love or hate Marmite because in seriousness, boys, it’s just a heap extract HAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breath through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your wimpers were burned and these firefighters would be.
Let people go.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, film night events and municipal meetings, but they are also the places where people dress up and turn their underwear.
Related: Don’t forget to start a relationship at the university
Introverts receive severe treatment at the university.
Her room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room bubble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a communiton is tired of compellingness - and send him a SMS instead.
Apply to: Do it.
A guy in my student home had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Friendship closes by baking.
As you start the university at the top of the back-many, climbing at the doors of people to imagine with a table full of Brownies, less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I have something back to you. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
To offer home-made taste cakes is a good way to close friends.
Your fellow residents feel committed to having fun and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, it depends on whether you are a decent pepper.
Badly mixed clumps from butter, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you crash.
To steal food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, chicken clown is a thief, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's upset, and you have my compassion - but try to get balanced as my co-habitant who added a washmiddel to your milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn’t make noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It is not only about being a decent person, but that you belong in the true sense of the proverb among the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if it would make them feel a little calm, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even more loud music.
When she finally stopped at 5 p.m., she let her neighbors sleep friendly two hours before she let her own music shine, closed her door and went to her three-hour examination.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally enter the same student home?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be deeply embarrassed if you hold a co-habitant for your future spouse, get stuck at them, get separated, and then have to see them every day, and perhaps live in the way she moves all the common friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot co-habitant is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to invoke a little reason to your subway.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the boundary between an ulk and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good stretch is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a bumerang.
Give a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding – but never embarrass anyone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but fix your property on the ceiling no more than twice.
Houses for refugees, lonely-training, gearing earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds houses in the middle-eastern corner valley for people who don’t have much money.
So, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the only educated mother and the dignified."
“I’m showing how to build cheaply and well today,” the 44-year-old said in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be pushed into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how fast an affordable living room can be created: he builds in a project row houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or sports halls has no sustainability.
Because people stay here in a large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need enough living space in the next decades.
A very banal, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are staying in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I will go back.
Then the houses can be easily reconstructed according to the respective needs.
How much is the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of residence per house is 184 000 euros, without property.
That's overviewable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations simplified their plans?
Gildner: Construction lawfully I correctly conducted my project.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening Damoklesschwert special construction and the placement regulation.
It's awful.
It is still assumed that who builds three apartments in a series house needs at least three seats.
Only in the cities there is no place for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their row house project?
Gildner: There were some who have pledged me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely wrong.
But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It’s true: We have had a building tree in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need a living room.
Not only the refugees, but also the only educated mother or the earner.
I show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's why it's going.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially engaged in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Updates Is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they receive a error message that tells you that the "software update" has failed.
To address the problem, users are advised to wait either until the storm falls down or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by delaying the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool, delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be disabled on halfways and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full Attacks
Nico Rosberg, in the fight for the Champions League title in Formula 1 against his clear-minded Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton, knows only one devise: "Fulle Attake".
The WM second emphasized before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, "I have nothing to lose anymore."
53 points separate the Vice World Championship before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defenders and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous 12 season races and also takes the Flotlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British were able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have influence on the great price of Singapore, it is still unclear.
For days a dark blow has been over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The three-month-founded Schachclub "Chachfriend Bad Kissingen" included another member in his series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionately shackled and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the course.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the First Class Bundesverdienst Cruise and the honorary citizen of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The Schach Club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation received by President Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to incorporate chess players who are unable to make the membership contribution.
Youth and talent work should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the Shah Club and friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Red-White" be seen as an expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Neighborhoods are looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Ancient Antonistift Centre have gathered under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new route at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the center of the city.
This is exactly the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
There was recently opened a new neighbourhood office.
Here, right next to the shopping market, you will immediately receive information from seniors and consultants about questions such as health insurance or services of healthcare and care funds.
For years, with our ambulance care service, we have found that often nursing relatives are left alone.
There are infinite many questions.
"There are also rarely many cash services will not be used because the complexity of insurance is hardly yet to understand," explained the new housewife Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible as business director for the help of the Antonift and the Civil Hospital as well as the Ambulance Service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as stomach prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis are perfectly complemented.
Saludis is for prevention, precaution and reha.
“The Senior Center for Care and Care,” painted Heike Riedel, CEO of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new neighbourhood office in the city centre is particularly in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, according to Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD), at the celebrations of intervention, the Quarter Office is also committed to the age of association: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these are invited to a regular moral meeting."
Thus, the Social Foundation has made a great contribution to the elderly to be able to live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 pm and Saturday from 10 to 12 pm.
Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on October 6.
Now it is official: after the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-ligist Würzburger Kickers has not been established for rehabilitation at the Fuchspark Stadium, October 6 is now set as a date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Toto Cup against the third-ligist FC Würzburger Kickers was now finally terminated.
It is played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19 p.m. at Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
“We are happy to know when the game is going on the scene, now we have planning security,” FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also pointed out the pre-sale of cards now established.
It is special for our team to play against a third party.
We hope to many viewers, and this is not without reason, because flood light games have a special rise.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg won the FC Oberhaid (3:1) in 2010 by victory and at home against the FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5,000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB 2016/2017 Association Cup.
Title defender is third-party SpVgg Unterhaching.
Wiener architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna Architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the Artist House reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses a member of honor and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was mentioned in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture during and after World War II at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Formation.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasure chamber in the Wiener Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Lobkowitz Palace to the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese Promotes Police With Money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese was noted in Bremen.
At one time, Tim Wiese, former national warrior in Germany, was engaged in Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
He wants to add 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years, according to his own statement.
However, he hasn’t applied intellectually.
Wiese was just able to cut her hair in the Bremer city centre when he saw a parking guard outside exposing a criminal shelter for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then threw out of the business, insulted the official, and threw her the worthy money punishment in front of her feet, as the "Image" newspaper reported.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences of the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The thing is still in examination," it says from the city of Bremen.
Only after that will be decided whether the track will be displayed or not.

Men strike 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft station.
There were also three people on the grounds of the gasoline station.
One of these men shouted to the young man and struck him in his face.
The victim suffered a nose break and bleed strongly from the nose.
When his two friends rebuilt and rebuilt on the slaughter, he first left his sacrifice.
From his friends, the injured young man was now brought home.
The criminal followed the group by a truck to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked by the kidnapper and another male person.
With the help of a strike, the victim's face and the upper shells were wrapped up.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the offence.
One of the men was approximately 1.80 meters tall.
The second shot was about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jean and a brown-white shirt.
The police asks witnesses and notants to sign up at the phone number 06181/100-123.

There is also a joy to the Mayor of the Communities Bernd Bormann, economicsförderer Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, doctors missing - Asendorf has luck: There Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the coming months with a half place.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller will reopen the practice on October 12th, until it invests 310000 euros in the spaces on St. Marcellus Road 6.
It was sympathy at the first glance when the rock houses met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who currently graduates their specialist training in the World Hospital and wants to go into practice next year.
"We always had in the back mind that the mullers would fit well in this practice," Dr. Ursel Felstehausen laughs.
"When it was so long, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea to conduct their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us,” said the 39-year-old Müller.
“We want to meet and accompany families over the years.”
It is also an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed that the mullers bought the house with practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, two-family father Frank Müller has also grown up, following his medical study in Hannover stations in several medical practices, as well as hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
Currently, he is a supervisor in Sulingen, as well as was appointed the leading emergency doctor in the Diepholz Circle in 2009 and is honorably engaged in the DRK production Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19th, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home doctor, his Gattin Ursel (Internistin) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The mullers, both interns, want to be settled as domestic doctors.
“The endoscopy is coming out,” said the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and load EKGs and need a more speaker room.
The DV is also completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 will be granted to the Müllers as part of a grant programme from the countryside (EUR 25000) as well as from the municipality (12500) and the municipality (12500).
"This shows how proud and proud we are that practice is going to be continued," said Mayor of the Communities Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, approximately 2,000 patients come to the practice of Felstehausen each quarter, where the average of the North German practice is about 500.
There is another home medical practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice taken by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains, according to Ursel Felstehausen, in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
Anyone who visits Müller’s speech hours continues to look primarily at familiar faces: takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rock houses.
With their goodbye ending in Asendorf, however, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls smugglingly.
A little sadness has been felt after a long time.
“But we are still living in Hohenmoor and many patients will certainly still see often,” the internist says.
Your husband laughs laughingly: "We have a 6000 square meter base piece."
"Before I've always been pressured by garden work, now it could be different."
The couple also has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We leave refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be lifted at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum application can do this also "comprehensible".
The supply and safety of people is in the forefront.
But it is also clear that “it needs clear signals,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even beyond the Austrian-Slovanian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Corridor" - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously notified that Slovenia would also want to continue travelling to Austria and Germany and could also establish corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the case with Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely inacceptable" and Slovenia will rather intensify border surveillance, especially to Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia has already been severely controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to close its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter East Croatia at the border crossing of Tovarnik/Sid in order to escape the registration.
The Croatian police were able to attack her in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, the Croatian Tovarnik has been constantly entering police vehicles with new refugees.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country accounts for about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serb border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would move towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade claims that it is it that the people should be able to set up certain routes: "We can neither, nor do we want to do so," he said.
According to the media reports, at least in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in Serbian border city Sid, further buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The prisoners had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border of about 500 kilometers away.
“We’ve heard that Hungary has forced us, so the police have told us we should go here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to continue travelling through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could now actually lead to the shift of the previously predicted Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungarians to a slightly western route, which was already predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Incomplete possibilities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "complete possibilities for border control."
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, since the EU partners have since issued a good testimony to the country with regard to the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border zone.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent last night at the crossing of Horgos, leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to continue to travel to the Croatian border, it is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local autumn in Horgos: he held the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
You can’t say if they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers recommend migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aids have already started to distribute to the refugee maps on which alternative routes are recorded by Croatia.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, not spaced mining fields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police reported that a team of miners were sent to the border region.
Stock Exchange Hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is expected to have heard a ring of cybercriminals, which is alleged to have repeatedly provided an insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the information obtained, Insider businesses have been made to the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, more than $100 million were gained.
“The present comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally captured,” the SEC statement said.
The trials against 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The criminals should have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospiz Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim parade square rules rain operation.
People make their concerns, partially quick steps, partially comfortable bubble.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Car Salon on the parade square.
Maintaining urban trails.
Pulsive, prallful life at wonderful autumn sunlight and pass four large tables each with the title "Before I Want to Die"....
The ecumenical hospice help made this action attention to its 20-year-old existence and faces completely mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospiz assistance is available to passengers as well as for questions and conversations as well as for honorary employees.
While some people spontaneously catch up to the circle and say the phrase about "beat my life", "be able to read", "driving through the U.S. camper", "stop the war" or "not long suffer" supplemented, others remain short, read, say phrases like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.
There are always small discussions about action on itself, about life, how to deal with death.
Peter Hübinger is also in place.
“Only if I understand that whenever the end comes to me in this world, I can live responsiblely,” says Mannheim, director of the Diaconic Work, which is in collaboration with the Carita Association Wearers of Ecumenical Hospiz Aid.
This public action is therefore good for a 20-year-old.
Not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, but be understandable, finally, it’s a very personal thing.
The theme of death and death continues to have tabus, according to Josefine Lammer’s experience, although the host movement has just contributed a lot to the opening of people in recent years.
An estimate that shares Angelika Godefroid.
The death and sadness escort is one of the honorary employees of the first hour.
Through personal experience facing the theme, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospiz sought for honorary offices by call, she immediately reported and participated in its founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and relatives in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and at the Sankt Vincent Hospital.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is able to deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences.
“I see life from another wait, consider it valuable and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the ambulance Eco-Ecumenic Hospice service is free of charge and confession-independent.
The financial support of health care funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of death and sadness associates.
Every two years training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Additional personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx mixed results, reduced financial statements for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit prospects to a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its land transport service.
The company also said it plans to add about 55,000 seasonal workers to the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 per financial year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than in previous predictions.
Analysts expected, according to a survey of FactSet $10.84.
The smaller prospects come despite the price rises, which will be 4.9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4, and despite higher increases in land transportation of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November.
The company said that it still expects the result to rise compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, said the company “considers the weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS, which plans to set up 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which were predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
The sales increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its unit of express shipping.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the sales of land transport increased by 29 percent, but the operational result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher working costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they concluded with 11 percent losses for the year and 17 percent under a record height on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategy spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the Leicester for the first time in almost a decade.
Round over them at the end of the decorated, two-storey session hall is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should prioritize the nation’s economic interests.
The Central Bank has a double order from Congress: Maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start, from which the unforgettable incentive is to be withdrawn by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data show that they are growing solid, the latest turbulence in the global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal bonds – and it is only a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a prerequisite not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is sufficiently justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed is going to do, which disregards the financial market itself.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg have predicted interest rate rise this week.
However, the financial markets expect an expectation of the Fed, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the frase, unless the strategies melt the strike by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the average Dow Jones Industrial jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will retain the set this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at that time,” he said.
If she does, “you should go too far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don’t get panicked.”
Other experts argued that interest rate rising would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed good to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow deterioration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that despite the complaints of Liberals that more economic progress would be needed this year, it expected an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, improvements in the labour market this year were solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wages increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
“The economy can manage higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China revalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 percent under its highest level in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would move global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the highest of May.
For Fed representatives, market turbulences affect complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would be attracted to the trains in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former U.S. Note Bank staff.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better in hand.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts will be on the U.S. economy, and there are almost no reliable data that describes the developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The central bank’s influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere note of then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "cover" its monetary expansion solved confusions around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly flooded, the Fed representatives can expect not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreasons on financial market movements that appear to be not linked to the economic basic data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to increasing interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its line by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited noticeable impacts on growth in the United States", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts reverse.
The Fed should only put aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's Interest Determination Committee.
The latest turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly won't get into the situation where she fears an increase of interest because the markets are rising," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think it should be predicted for time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/house is a central attraction and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and cooks, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department when you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to slide through the gangs.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and cheap) in this store is located near the boxes and has various acceptance options.
What is here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat store is extensive, as well as the fish store - the staff behind the tea will clean and file the fish and even broke on request for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melone and galgant, whole ents, fish, beef blood and gal, pig natural intestines, fish beams, regional grass, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and kitchens, including individual families and individuals.
The wide belts are suitable for shopping carts and gabels.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees are coming to Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless honorary helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unindividual asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with its 74 lenses, she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday, she does it at the asylum candidate home on the Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language.
Of course, this is a very different lesson than at a right school.
Brazil’s pediatric society Rio Grande promotes healthy breastfeeding diet
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to shockingly learn about the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are sowing to breasts that are covered with pictures of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should take.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, a child’s unhealthy diet can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The Bernried Municipal Council approved the construction application for the €2.3 million expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flat for the solar system.
The plans for the long-running sports building at Bernrieder Sports Areas are step by step: in the recent municipal meeting, the drafted construction application was unanimous without large discussions.
Earlier, the Board had, among other things, decided on an application for an "exemption" of the construction law, respectively "release" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was the permission for a special form of roof construction.
Consequently, it is intended to build a "stable tea with non-mediate front and roof surface".
In the background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations: "This will bring us a wonderfully large southern roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In turn, the "release" was about the roofing, which should be less than ten degrees for energy reasons than required in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
Therefore, a "release" was necessary because the construction plan with regard to the roofing does not allow "exceptions" - whereas the Bernrieder Municipal Council usually refers rather restrictively to exemption applications.
However, it is not a recurring project: “We do not create a precedent,” said Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau in the sports center is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
At cost, around €2.3 million are calculated.
Subsidies are expected from school and wide sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now submitted to the Land Council for examination.
Peißenberg Clinic travels to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes a new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station, as well as the majority of employees, move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Landkreis, confirmed by Land consultant Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision was made by the Supervisory Board, which will take place next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans are implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the still existing internal station.
The rooms are present.
The employees who can't go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-White.
The employees are informed of the plans.
The change has led to the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the doctor director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice closer to the hospital.
In the question of who should follow the following, according to Jochner-White, the name "Fischer" came into the game, who declared ready to take the lead and move with his team to Schongau from October 1st.
For the house in Schongau, this means, in any case, a "revaluation" and a dissemination of the offer in the area of "Internal Medicine", according to Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist in heart stepmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
For the next two years, fisherman and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to lead both houses, will be closed to Peißenberg until the next year, the former hospital, which still has 35 beds, will be closed to Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the country circle had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing rehabilitation at Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Land consultant Jochner-White, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Council, met with rumors that the house in possession of the federal deficit is to be used as a home for asylum seekers in the future.
"I shut it off." As it goes on with the real estate, Jochner-White couldn't say there were several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
“What couldn’t happen to us, such an opportunity wouldn’t come back,” said Fischer over the Quasi-Up to the leather that was taken “positive and very understandable” by the employees.
A real perspective for the house where the fisherman has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years has not been there.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the posts of the Doctor’s Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (about 100 beds) was repeatedly threatened by closing over the past decades, departments were closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handsballers of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are required tonight at Mount HC at 20:15 p.m.
Although the board leader of the Bundesliga is the obvious favourite in Wuppertal, there is no cause of superiority.
During the last season, the Badeners had a painful defeat at the BHC and had some good luck there.
Hunting attack with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their marijuana on Tuesday afternoon by shooting.
During the Aberntens on a maize field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, as police reported.
A 63-year-old man, a 22-year-old, suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly it could have happened to the accident, it was unclear at first.
The Criminal Police detected.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Pfalz victims of violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Pfalz missing since Saturday.
In an interview, the 20-year-old admitted to killing young people and throwing their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Pfalz missing since Saturday has been victimized by violence.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as state prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old detained on Tuesday night also was considered to be suspected, who held the fact according to the statement and led the investigator to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the evening after a visit to a fall festival in Rockenhausen.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first shot on personal objects of the victim.
In interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, there was finally a suspicion of acts against the 20-year-old.
The suspect led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
The detained, according to the police, admitted to the 16-year-olds who killed and put the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the detained judge on Wednesday, the investigators put him to death.
The conclusion of the closer circumstances of the act is to bring further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: study warns from housing shortages
The location on the German housing market is stressed.
More and more refugees are also looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution struggles in the German housing market have long begun.
With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units must be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the Association of Social Housing Building.
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay as asylum seekers to live in a first stay.
Many then jump into the housing market and fall into the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Bureau of Statistics, less than half of all asylum seekers lived last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also made significant negligence in the housing policy of the past few years.
Germany produces a housing deficit, which is increasing year by year.
Currently, about 770,000 residential units are already missing in the balloon areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals lived in large cities in emergency services in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed unwillingly longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flood on the housing market.
In large cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance "Social housing construction" proposes a restart.
New incentives will rebuild social housing.
In this way, the basic tax can be rejected and the basic tax for promoted housing can be temporarily suspended.
In addition, the alliance says that attractive tax deduction options are needed.
The state bank KfW’s refugee housing programme is now well-approved in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, it had already been withdrawn with 184 million euros on Monday night, with more than half of the available 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have a free flight: Croatia and Slovenia set a corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no passage, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to pass through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to be familiar with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor.
"I spoke to Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not a Schengen country yet.
After the departure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to reach West Europe from there.
500 people have crossed the border with Tovarnik, the Croatian television channel RTL reports.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees yesterday.
New laws that entered into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically excessive.
Croatia wants to let refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: “You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity.”
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
There are people who didn’t want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had captured the first refugees at the border with Serbia to the EU-Nearby country of Croatia in the morning.
Most media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border city Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serb border, however, refugees do not strike border zones.
For this, the border strings provide other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Now miners are planning to create a safe passage quickly.
After Hungaria, however, there is little more refugees after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
At the end of Monday, it was 9380.
The new Hungarian laws suspended the overcoming and injury of the borders as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the Southern border town of Szeged.
The convicted threatened prison sentences of up to five years and the dismissal of the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees had stayed there.
However, no one has ever had an opportunity to receive asylum in Hungary.
Hungary believes Serbia is a "safe third country".
Rejected asylum seekers should be dismissed there.
Before the transit zone in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean it up.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left on the streets over the past few weeks.
Lockers were decomposed and one of the recording camps in the border area was reconstructed.
For this purpose, no one wanted to express himself.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to government reports.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany.
The train transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instructions by German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayor's "stranded" crossed the border
"We were busy cleaning after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing with travel bags at the entrance to the tent," said Wernstein mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists wanted to get to Passau by train.
But because Germany had surprised the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was over in Wernstein,” Stadler said, who immediately offered his assistance and the raidmen, along with two other assistants and their cars, drove across the border to Near Passau.
Previously, we sold the unexpected guests for the first time, with jause and drinks.
We just said we'll take them with the car to Passau.
"It was of course for us," Stadler said in the OÖN talk.
You were very grateful.
A man could not take a generous donation - 100 euros for the firefighter.
“It’s a great pleasure,” Stadler said.
The railroad passengers were transferred from a ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday night to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the railroad was suspended to Germany.
However, the regional train was suspended before the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival was associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, a two-bridge race sporty earlier - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavarian from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends to us another tens of thousands is a logical result of an apparently sacred policy:
Instead of assisting in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity immediately, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly pushed the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dark circle of national socialism.
The sufferings of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Refugees will also have to find that the “great land” that they invited and welcomed is nothing but a refugee camp.
It will be a big challenge to create human-worthy conditions for refugees in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter.
And it will be even bigger - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad is looking for 35,000 winter-fest quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee housing.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful raiffeisen bankers to establish quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first pick-up center of Traiskirchen has already been handled by Konrad.
“We no longer have homeless in Traiskirchen,” he told his first success.
Also, the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday had occurred without a large spin, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
On the contrary, the Ministry of Interior spoke of a “crisis-constant situation”.
Overall, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, there will be 35,000 accommodations to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries, 15,000 of the union.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
“But it’s not a fasc without ground,” Konrad said.
He has already spoken with the heads of the country.
They would have assured him to create even for the upcoming refugee quarters.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, we hope that hotels are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In emergency times, it may not be that the quarter holders must comply with a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the top lights.
For a temporary time, "Urgent Standards" must apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of Interior, Konrad founded his experience.
I am an elderly lord, to whom the truth is not called without any other face.
Conviction is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves said.
They want to increase their employees to three to four.
The search for your neighborhood has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set a container at Stephans Square as an office.
However, there are apparently problems with the approval.
Linz requires better distribution
First, the city of Linz plans not to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the affected persons can currently stay without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For the emergency, however, other locations should be checked on their sustainability.
The mayor criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts have to make their contributions here too.
Seehofer: "Grests are not locked off"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday announced further action in the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not shut down.
Refugees are still travelling to the Federal Republic.
However, there are currently the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, the defendants would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue by the other EU Member States.
The fact that Austria is now reintroduced controls at its borders is for Pühringer a "logical consequence" from the German action.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general restoration of the "New Werft" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the stock exchanged IT group S&T is enrolled, the rest (2700 square meters) to be rented to young and innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart heads are our raw materials – and we need to try to work for us,” says S&T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in startup companies of the New Werft and later acquiring them.
S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours from the beginning - some of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a question of time."
1.7 million euros have been invested in the location by S&T, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center, which belongs to one third of Linz City, the country of Upper Austria and the FFG.
The building is owned by Linz AG for 60 years by S&T and Techcenter.
30 per cent of the 2700 square meters of the building are already rented, for another 40 per cent are given requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opens the second store in the Arkade
Furla handbags are at the center in the new store.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to have a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to take this project shortly on the Taubenmarkt arcade: Finally, she has now gained growth in the form of another business room.
In the furla store against the shop in which it sells, among other things, bags, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, it is now all about women's handbags of the brand Furla, cash exchanges are from €75.
Larger pockets and accessories cost up to €500.
Since yesterday, the new store has been in operation.
A few weeks before it was rebuilt.
"But I've long been thinking if I'm going to open another store," said Breit.
Important for the decision was, among other things, that the furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also made from the idea of a place where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz area that sells this brand," said the mother of two daughters who even had Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has put wide from her mother into the wheel.
I’m the most busy when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why such a woman, when looking at a beautiful handbag, can’t even be able to answer the expert.
Maybe it's because a nice pocket revalues every outfit.
The noisemaker from Kallstadt
Donald Trump’s predecessors came from a place whose inhabitants are called attackers.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciters.
Whether he expresses himself foreign hostile, disputes journalists, or reveals lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. President’s office strongly urges the election fight.
And cut it well.
This is also recorded in Pfalz’s cold city, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with the flour frisur is a term for many in the wine village on the winestraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place are over -zig corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kall City in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the election mode.
The Cold City Councilor Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
“I think they find it somehow exciting, but they’re not so deeply impressed in their cool towns,” Simone Wendel says.
The native cold city lady has turned a fun documentary about the site and its famous speakers, including Trump’s Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for his modesty, also comes in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful even if he would live in Kallstadt.
To the king of the heart he did not bring it there.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, it is also tend to be the opinion that Trump is "as a little as a big mouse," Wendel says.
Randomly, the top name, which has the cold city around, sounded "The Brulljesmacher" - too high German: the attackers, she says.
Trump comes from the attackers’ village.
Trump’s success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for golden tombs in the United States.
Basestone of the real estate company were the first property purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragic: their desire to return to their home for a long time failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Pfalz at that time belonged.
He did not record Trump because he had once cancelled without permission, the director of the Institute for False History and Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared the film start.
Trump is the grandchild of an "unlawful expatriate".
This is in contrast to the occasional marking statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken abruptly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and requested the construction of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"That's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker looks the American rather distant, "he's always so breaking up."
Do you think Trump is coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” said the 72-year-old.
"He's never cared about Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the family Heinz gave some donations to the Church’s Normandie when visiting, which generally came well.
“I can’t imagine that about Donald,” said the 68-year-old.
She finds it better if he doesn't like the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had the case at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him, “he would never have arrived there at all.”
“There are more interesting topics than he,” says winemaker Sarah Bühler.
And as a president?
“My president is not,” she said.
“The grapes will be mature without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump was long interviewed, saw 12,000 filmmakers, also awakened interest in the United States.
The Oberbayer municipality of Ramsau at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President of the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award on Wednesday for soft tourism.
In Austria there are already 20 “Bergsteiger Villages”.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteiger village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protective area.
Seven’s Sunrise dominates the reviews despite Nine’s attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson go to Canberra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it hasn't made any major moves in the ratings for Today.
Nine’s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull hit Tony Abbott’s collapse.
The rival sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, joined London as part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339.000.
Today was a slight increase in the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today, Sunrise has been closed over the past few months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
By September, Sunrise has an average of 339,000 viewers at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the review!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recent-white father, who decides to sit down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could wear a hit show Solo without Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17.30 pm) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, produced an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 p.m. to 18:00 p.m.) jumped on 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour sat 720,000.
Hot seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of The Chase Australia’s second evening will Nine confidently vote that the hot-seat will finally run at 17:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a Million Dollar Minute that failed to cross the McGuires Show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unconsciously revealed who wins the Bachelor.
The woman, at Sam Wood in The Bachelor, finally landed, was hidden in the greatest secret.
And none of the three girls remaining will certainly not disclose whether she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before three of them were two, you may have accidentally given a note of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically reassured why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitudes as a reason why they like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get Woods' last rose?", their answers to the gambling devastator could become who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam’s energy, I felt they were quite compatible, and I thought about it throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah stands on the ground with both feet, it’s so fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week's visit made her clear that Wood could be "der One".
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this was obviously not just a game – I’m now set on him without prejudice,” she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's an uncertainty between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30 p.m., to Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banned Hayne to bank for the rest of the game when he lost a ring as much as the Aussie Rugby League converter did at his first point return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to get a point return and also to the ongoing game after a injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the clothing cabin after the game.
Instead of painting his Rookies before the rest of the team through the mould, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne at his press conference after the game.
49’s sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne plays at a point restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian follow up for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the game field after the Fumble and later told Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
“It was a thing that happens now, you just care about the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the cutter with his original debut in 2007, when a passport in his own in-goal area led to a trial for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with arms force.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, arrested his oil company Yukos and suspended his democratic efforts.
Free voters demand the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees.
Party and group chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt from a severe crisis at Bavarian schools if there are no new teachers accordingly for many new students: “We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse,” Aiwanger said.
"We'll be able to gain gains in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfraction of the Free Voters Days until Friday in the Subfrank municipality.
In fact, quite different main topics were provided.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free voter meeting.
"Of course, asylum will overthrow the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN shuttons for refugees in Syria, as it was during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s.
"This is not how we go, we have to find out the causes," said the free voter chief.
Asylum seekers want to dismiss the free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum laws: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal countries were not consistent: "We need federal uniform standards."
"Bayern's off, others don't."
“We need to be more acting.”
However, the country policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new year of school, Minister of Culture, Ludwig Spaenle (CSU), in 47 high schools, has launched the pilot attempt "median level plus" which tests an extension of the high school middle level from three to four years - as a result it will take again nine years until the abortion.
However, this does not go far enough.
"The G9 issue must be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shooting rubber on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber shots in a crowd that demonstrated the proposed new constitution, a official said Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district official, said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police had used tear gas and then shot in the air before she re-attractioned rubber shots.
20 Police and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, of which it is known to kill, but traditionally used as less fatal alternatives, seemed to produce such a high death rate.
The debate was the last violent protests in Nepal’s southern levels in weeks, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces, formed under the proposed new constitution, would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent disputes since 10.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain provisions in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu, and officials said the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Planned building area in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city currently prepares everything for marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of trade, business and housing is planned - but there are still no concrete offers.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a large area of about 4,000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the youth center Alte Post.
The preparations for this are currently running.
It is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade, business and housing.
We are waiting for the corresponding offers, it is called on the side of the city.
What an investor is being questioned is not yet clear.
Consequently, no contracts have been concluded.
The city of Emden had a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / Angle Große Street, already purchased a few months ago and let the building on it out.
Project Hieve: Details on the table
The plans for holiday home settlement at the small sea at Emden take shape.
The investor for the first time presented public plans for the project.
Some investors are still worried - they are afraid of selling out their recreational refuge
For months, it was negotiated, scratched, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the small sea near Emden are on the table.
The stakeholder, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Buu", presented his plans for the first time publicly on Monday night in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group that preached to the investor and the management of secret cream, Ralf Behrends from the system building business leader went to the offensive: “We have not yet an answer to all questions,” he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to meet all the rumors now.
The costly projects of about 10 to 12 million euros have been discussed for months.
The pictures and new details highlighted the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, maritime owner and board member of the debtor’s interest representation, Pro Hieve, complained: “This is a giant cloth that overcomes all the other buildings.”
In addition, he fears, like some other project critics, that traffic by the planned size of the plant would be significantly increased: “There must be all bus loading to expect it,” Schulz said.
However, what is happening exactly on a large hectare area of the former guest house is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"We must have a decisive concept first," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this is still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Zwillings-growing at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is excited to grow with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian has brought about twins yesterday.
Double births are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is nearly 50 years ago and was in Frankfurt in 1967, it says from the Zoo.
The gender of the newborn Gorilla twins is still uncertain, since Mother Dian still holds them close to the body.
First, the "image" was reported.
NHC says 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday a wide depth pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernest Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical spine storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined deep pressure system, e.g. in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antills, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical spinal storm in the next two days, the weather experts stationed in Miami added.
Google launches double spread campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL. O) announced a double-spending campaign to spend $11 million on humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrolled the European nations as they fled from the war.
Google has an unusual personal approach to announce the donation call on its blog.
Rather than allowing a manager to announce, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
“Our journey included many dark trains and buses, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I had luck.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations are available to four non-profit organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations were doubled up to a value of 5.5 million at google.com/refugee release to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that has deported more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya in the war.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether people with slightly overweight diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"Death data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide article on the new study at JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipositas operations have proved to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are diseasedly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital researchers used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of Adipositas surgery - the gastro-bypass and gastro-intestinal formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal at 29.
Among those undergoing a surgical intervention, 36% of the diabetes disease totally and partly 28% solved.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely solved by only one percent and in part by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure controls, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the "surgical" group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitor the patient’s blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best held under 7%, the researchers wrote.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - as you reflect in improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgical group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), increased decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and reported more complete overcoming diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years, there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer lifetime, Blackstone, University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix, says.
In the Swedish study, people with obesity who had been undergoing an adipositas surgery were approximately 29 percent less likely to die over the age of 15 – compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit to survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was calming for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group,” without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we make people take this seriously," she said.
I think as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their body to obesity and diabetes, a reverse is really difficult.”
Love story plays in Hunsback
It is a topic that is currently increasing attention in the Belletristic: a young woman, at school unpopular and unlikely, meets the shadow of her youth after years, and this one falls in love with her.
Likewise, in the recent novel “We are not like that” by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel might be interesting especially for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is delighted that she has been able to place a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot take all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged him to end the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances given, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not adequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to deal with the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development can be created, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he said.
Finally, we need to think about how the killings are reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the 11 September terror attack and found that the U.S. violent reaction was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is in violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold Increased Intake of Hand Disinfectants by Children Over the Last 4 Years
Toxin control centers in the U.S. report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who are severely swallowing alcoholic hand-infecting agents, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of hand desinfectants in children under 12 years of age, reporting to toxicity control centers, increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to the emergency,” Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking desinfectants, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a courageous sample on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how youths drink desinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Youths have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic water to get a harder drink.
Young children can be attracted by attractive smells of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think that's bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand desinfectants) are those who are perfume.
There are disinfectants with earth beers, grapes and orange fragrance that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially in small children, a few injections can already lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Call Center at the hospital of Kansas University, the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let a whisky rise up, but people leave this hand desinfectant within children’s reach, and if children come to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes of a scent of hand disinfectants at the school, was brought to an emergency treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold legally considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah shouted their words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate child hospital with signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen by alcohol and hit her head, said Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended to parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand-infectants outside the child’s scope.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after the closing of hand desinfectants that contained a toxic, undeclarated ingredient.
Health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution instead of ethyl alcohol that was noted as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York plan to poison their “common” teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom,” a police report reports.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand-infecting agents and bans her out of her room.
The police regarded the plan as a "speaking" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In case of an accident on the cross-range between the north ring and the oxen, a 33-year-old driver has been mildly injured in an accident.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving the cross-range towards circular traffic industrial area and noticed that it was too late to stop two predecessor vehicles in circular traffic.
As a result, he jumped into the hill of an Audi with his truck and jumped on a Ford Fiesta standing before it.
The accidental vehicles injured about 10 000 euros, police reported.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready and had to be scratched.
Revelation: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays the speech of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn it back again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson’s accusation and Warburton will be careful in January-new obligations that could destroy the framework’s unit
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points

Griffiths plays talks about disharmony
There are rumours about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, which was that he and his crew cameras are not under increased control as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don’t think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored the Netherlands - the Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said, "In the Netherlands they no longer show up points of Celtic games and why?"
That's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Company games, and it is not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has agreed that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swears to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent defeat from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, which are now clearly at the top of the table with five points.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that exactly - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Now being together is so important.
Warburton with caution in January-Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he had pushed some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new accesses and insists that he does not want to disturb the unit of the Ibrox frame.
The former head of Brentford said, "January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
Players who come in the summer have this predecessor time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal warning
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, has indicated that he could withdraw if his contract expires at the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been crushed with a sad nose for two years and has failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilson Comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the defender was later revoked - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson continues to do what he said and insists: “I haven’t questioned integrity, I haven’t commented on performance.”
Griffiths swore to avoid Tynecastle
The unemployed hibee was administered after he admitted to sing a song with insightful texts about ex-heart player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a Roseburn area in Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the storm said, and added, "It's safe to say I'm not coming back to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around – but it is the fact that the fall must end on the game field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We will bring the boys back to the trap,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton "uncomfortable".
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen desperately had to fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that introduced them a five-point precedence in front of Celtic thanks to Adam Rooney's elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won everything, in championship games or songs, who have never won the games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it rises in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in May to July by 164,000, while the number of unemployed people for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1,82 million during the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the UK’s 5.5 percent, as figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a number above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said, "The long-term plan of the government has set the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost just a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drinks disrupted the course
Since the security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepperspray, the officials were able to arrest the disturbances.
A respiratory alcohol test resulted in a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and remained in custody at first.
Why I Will Be a Witness of an Execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope it won't happen, I'll sit in a watch gallery in the Oklahoma State prison room when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do that?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see convictions in the United States, and since more applications are often available than places, there is a matching lottery that takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips with a close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a visit for two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officials say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complained about her.
She realized she could have "formed it better," but she still thinks it's wrong with what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he would.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have done.
I don't want to enter all the details here again.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would blame him to be a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe there is no evidence enough to justify a death sentence.
I think his sentence is wrong.
From this perspective I will see him dying.
I can’t claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can contact.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man dying in need of death.
Man invaded after wet police persecution to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he convinced the man from the Canning River.
A attempt by a man from Perth, who was dependent on the police, was unsuccessful when he was in the sea and sowing water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "convince him slightly to return to the shore."
The police in Canning Vale were called for a home peace break in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and take me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he urged a more reliable tactic - "a good policeman negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the tombs to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired by locals in the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claimed that Stewards tried to spy him and threatened to end the race sport
Peter Moody claimed that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spion in his place last year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He targeted the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had conducted a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching due to a race start-up treatment, the last strohhal on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing sports and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive kobalt tuber sample at Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had stopped for 18 months due to spies and didn’t want it “to look like too hanging grapes.”
"I had nothing to say about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything came out at once," Moody said.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to cross the upper head, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If you start thinking I don’t do that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I need to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stall.
“Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my stairs to provide information about what I am doing within my stairs,” Moody said at Racing.com.
They seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that’s the case, they should surely stick to their nose because they’ve failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, ehem. President of the RVL, David Moodie, chairman of the RVL, and current CEO of the RVL, Bernard Saundry, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should that lead me to the view that it will be personal?
Does the RVL behave badly and maybe makes people responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say now let her think about it.
But now I have come to the point where it doesn't matter to me, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the coach have been built with Lidari's long-term cobalt survey, and the late scratching led to saying that he "can throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation for the unfinished master Black Caviar, described the raceday treatment rule as "laughter" after a package of slam or tone was applied to the horse legs, which was contrary to the rules.
“It is against the rules of race.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
“One of my employees misleadingly imposed slam on the leg.
That could have been last night.
It could have been the same yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was the same on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualified treatment with the package on the race day. An investigation of this issue was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested for drivers' escape
Police arrested a man on weekends after a collision with a bicycle driver and subsequent driver fleeing in Cobram.
The bike driver was introduced with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police in Shepparton appeared.
It is expected to be charged with a dismissed driver refuge and assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy returns against rivals for claims to fight rings
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the tackling of his players as "Agenda Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitration judges allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory at the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden comment on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "Modest Example" of the Rugby League and said that the two Queensland were not " too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklim of his team and said they were focused on their "contact" only when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team confidently voted for him as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
“It’s always happening – I haven’t heard Trent Robinson talk about ring fights when they hit us 24:2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has given us the trend turning.
Trent has been there for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not used to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It’s weird how this appears again in this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "naked" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting her game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they didn’t think of us when it was about Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are pause making and no points something exciting?
For me, these are the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend, since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening at the prefinal at AAMI Park. Ticket sales begins from the next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit after drug complaint
A man whose life-long punishment may threaten due to his attempt to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine, who were scamred to Queensland, was released against a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay that came from South America over Vanuatu and invested in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he hit his mitang charges at the jacket airport during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly lifelong punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that it could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of residence in the criminal case.
Maksimovic's mother and father had offered a deposit of $200,000 together as security to reach his release.
“After reading the previous statements of the two individuals, it is clear that the issue of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden,” said judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against deposit, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police daily and holds an outlet shutdown from 18:00 to 06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: guide house breaks out
In an accident of appearance with three trucks on highway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction station towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and attempted to escape to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The headquarters of the crash causes a total breakdown.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed over six hours to 2 p.m.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to attract pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to demand pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when he slept, logined in to an online messaging service, from which he received a series of irregular images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked at it, found the confusing reports and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used the terms to search for inconsistent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "predicted to be a police officer to scare them."
Attorney Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it would be a deceit that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on his computer, but he said it happened because he claimed he wanted to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to draw them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was crying and crying.
She also looked at the inadequate pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls who look much younger than he was.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty, in the sense of the prosecution, to have taken irregular pictures of children on June 14 last year, to have violated the charges on January 25 of this year and not to have appeared before a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg would not appear in the registry of sexual criminals, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael resigned the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted a deposit in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other remaining cases.
He was included in the directory of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Schleusers Reflect on Small Border Transitions to Germany
More and more refugees are captured away from the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many screws, because of fear of discovery and arrest, have caused people to grow in smaller border crossings.
on the side of Austria, a spokesman of the Federal Police said.
Over 1,000 refugees have been arrested in Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were walking over bridges and stauwehre to the German side.
There they are welcomed by federal police officers and redirected to register.
At Munich’s main railway station, more refugees arrived at the Federal Police Information compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
Only until 8 p.m. about 700 people arrived in the country’s capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
Following the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday, 1759 refugees reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropical tower "Henry" is expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn about storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a deep pressure area across West Europe, hot sea air currently flows into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) reported in Stuttgart.
The powerful depth is the launcher of the tropical tower "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands.
Strong storms and storms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, it is still expected in the Black Forest, in the Swabian Alb and in the ground sea circle with bads from 60 to 90 hours kilometers.
On Friday, the sun can look longer.
The mass does it: Every two years car builders on the IAA show their news.
2015 is mainly a move to the compact cars, which currently sells very well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly questioned: approximately 28.1% of the new authorisations, according to the KBA, only in August to this segment.
This also reflects on the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be standing with traders in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” said Opel chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra will not be much more expensive for it.
Opel offers an inlet below the largest competitor VW Golf, starting at €17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
Hessen also offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which for the first time include two-cylinder gasoline.
Unlike the most important competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only five-door.
As a second variant, the Kombi will follow in the spring, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Astra on the IAA with new compact cars?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Megane in the race.
At the fair, the Megane can be seen exclusively as five-doors in a conventional and emphasizing sporty GT version.
He comes to trade at the beginning of next year, then as a kombi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan Ableger wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its welded lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates his world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum rotating moment, according to manufacturers, is at 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The start of sales of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but roundly renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën blender set mainly hand on the front side: here the cooler grill was redesigned and the modified lights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been mainly modernized, reducing the number of buttons through a touchscreen and integrating Apple CarPlay for the first time.
In addition, the IAA has a range of updates and new variants in the compact class, such as the updated Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters cells are inhuman
The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to a former executive institution Tegel, who had been lodged in a small cell for months.
Due to the infringement of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation when they are inhabited in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can hope for money even if they were locked in close rooms for a few days (e.g. 1 BvR 1127/14).
This led to a success with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was lodged at the Berlin-Tegel Court between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor surface; the toilet was spatially not separated.
After that, the man who was now on his feet again, according to his lawyer, was moved into a larger cell.
His official charge was failed for the unworthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin.
However, the constitutional judges lifted the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and gave back the case for a re-examination there.
You see the man's dignity injured.
The Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Although, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention for the period concerned are relevant for compensation, there is a compensation claim.
Otherwise, it would be "a deceitful of the legal protection of personality".
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners.
In April, they only told a prisoner of damage because he was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, it is also worthwhile to multiplying a cell without a separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified an inhuman accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The complainant had stayed in a cell similar to in the Karlsruher case between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months.
The Berlin prisons have also entered the headlines for lack of staff in the last few weeks.
Inmates are therefore repeatedly enclosed 23 hours, increasing aggressiveness, even to strikes is expected to have already come due to the stressed situation.
According to the press office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of growth, 19 are expected to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We're going to do this"
Migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
About 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the Federal Ministry of Interior forecasts, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take up a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: “I say again and again: we can do it and we can do it.”
What happens to Germany provides the following overview.
According to different forecasts between 350000 (establation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (establation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (250000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially in affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price each year, and for these particularly affordable apartments, refugees will also apply.
Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from 518 million to a billion euros.
This is too little from the Pestel Institute's point of view: 80,000 social housing should be created annually and for this, the union should invest a promotion of 6.4 billion per year.
Some scientists and the Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research, 55 percent of the refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get in, Claudia Walter, Project Manager for Integration and Education at the Bertelsmann Foundation, criticized.
However, for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the reception society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: from the ban on work for refugees to recognition of work.
While there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers up to five years ago, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the obligation to residence restricted by asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, even because of the lack of expertise, the majority has implemented the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is no sufficient offer for general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most commonly transmitted by personal contacts.
Consequently, the construction of networks is, in the view of Thränhardt, the road to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children into the Kitas, estimated at ten to 15%: “For the rooted parents, it is only very important to keep the family together,” says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration.
However, to convince the family about the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
If the need for educators is strongly increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capabilities - for example by allowing more schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge will be prepared for the lesson in welcome classes.
But they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal asylum applicants or patience bans the study – the only exception has been Berlin until now, internal senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Students volunteer refugees could facilitate access to the university.
Refugees with a residence fee or duty no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicant’s Asylum Service Act when they start a study.
The latter will basically not receive a baffle, since they do not fall under the circle of the baffled persons.
To date, patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to be Bafög, which is shortened to 15 months from January 1, 2016.
However, these disadvantages must also be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin’s Secretary of State for Science, and the German Student Work.
Students should receive immediate baffle.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successfully provide Islam with the same rights as the churches, and further develop the existing State-Children-right to a new state-religious relationship.
It is also important to create an Islamic welfare association that cares professionally for the new arrivals.
The right also includes duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact partners and be willing to work with the State in many areas and give him certain controls.
This also includes the willingness to resist religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, said on Thursday concerns that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to endure such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to stay here, in Germany, accomplished," he said in Bayeric broadcasting.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society.
This will also need to change the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Although Germany has, as a result of European decisions, a anti-discrimination institution and a general equality law for a few decades.
However, it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignoring the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for everyone: What migrant organisations and non-white German stakeholders long demand and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention Germany have to make reality in the coming years when the country remains peaceful and will have its new citizens to take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of everyone.
In general, Germany is able to provide the expected refugees with medical attention, says Doctor’s President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What man power and capacity is, we'll do that," he said to the daylight.
However, additional money should be flown into the system.
In order to avoid miscarriage, Montgomery asks to grant all arrivals immediately when registering health cards.
Provided services could be calculated later with the federal countries.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited performance catalog which is provided for in the Asylum Applicants’ Asylum Service Act.
Otherwise, doctors will create language barriers in particular.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in medical practices, the interpreter costs should be taken over, she asks.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical approaches in the emergency ambulance.
And with a different diagnosis.
For example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities among refugee children, and young people are dealing with HIV disclosure.
With some other disease images, however, German doctors come from their education, Montgomery says.
"Parasetic attacks or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize," and as regards the lack of doctors, refugees may even be relieved in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practice, they have to demonstrate their qualification and may have to take tests again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from posttraumatic load disorder or depression.
Particularly vulnerable refugee children, Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK, said.
A recent study of the TU Munich shows that every five Syrian refugee children arrive traumatic in Germany.
Those who are suffering from posttraumatic load disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with breathing, swelling, heart races and death fears.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, severe scarcity, and emotional dizziness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
But so far, only 4 percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misconceptions, Munz says.
Mange invites to dream
With the new inscension "Passion" the Circus Probst turns back to the traditions of the circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the bans of fascinating acrobatics, animal trends and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites the mangues to wash on the seal to dream.
"Our passion is the circle."
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, veterinary teacher and Junior Chieffin.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current manage scene.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family.
The gift to enthusiasm, therefore, is in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to take people away from their everyday strait and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” the 27-year-old junior chief said.
"Mangecocktail with World City-Flair", as director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm in their bands.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the stupid films, the Cuban duo will be locker.
Easyness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at Mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous laughter salts, the acrobatic of the Circus Probst also fascinates fingertips and joint sensitivity.
Balancing with the wheel on a ball?
He Yuan is not a problem.
At the same time, snake people fascinate and frighten.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of the acrobatic as few others and fascinated with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disasters in the attitude of circus animals are just too often subject to various animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Probst also says, “If our animals don’t work well, we don’t work well too.”
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-bein artists" as they are called lovingly will be read, if possible, from the eyes of any desire.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn’t feel comfortable, it doesn’t want to go into the mangues either.
So the supreme commandment is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on her zebroid jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a zebrastute, the family is proud of it.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walk and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," Brigitte Probst says.
Although the zebroid is not ready for the mangues yet, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So, for every visitor, something might be there.
“One is safe,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with them with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites from 17th to 20th September every day to his performances at 17h and 20h.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11:00 p.m.
Thursday is family day, the prices are discounted for the presentation at 17:00 p.m.
In addition, the animal view is open every day from 10 to 18 pm.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case spread quickly over social media.
The opening of Parliament was also disturbed by allegations by opposition deputies that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned that they would accompany Mr. Mugabe's speech with buhrufs.
Last month, they had kicked him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received SMS messages on their phones warned them to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Dead'," he said in a statement.
She warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as she leaves Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The Chief Speaker said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "careful" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company’s services.
HP will be divided into two exchange-noted companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job loss leads to a burden of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies when moving to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better established than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will focus on providing unsuccessful, integrated technology solutions for companies so far," the company said.
It distributes a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical plants and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called the "Silicon Valley's birthplace".
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to manage the turning from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before playing against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is scheduled, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championships in the next summer is surely uncertain.
The big shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had been severely ending the last season after a separate necklace injury and then returned to his old swim during the predecessor.
“This type of injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his nodes or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from purely medical perspective, but, as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd reported 23 different Wilshere diseases since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 League games in the last five games.
The wider image for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs who have recorded most injuries in six out of eight games since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in the rate of injury will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes, when you come back from a injury, you have a sensitive period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will pass a career through the way he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger starts a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not traveling to Croatia, which means Mathieu may start Debuchy and Arteta.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give the players needing a small break,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to move forward through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest threatening effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unfinished after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shot by a earthquake on Tuesday evening, measured on the judges scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League capitalization against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the association to his first European championship triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The absence of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before, as proving suicide rates among young men at a 15-year-old high.
In 2013 it was the main cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign Against Living Miserably) announced 2015 as the man’s year to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to cope with this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the leader had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery were doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you only need to have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on the style of substance, the irremediability of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-successful and successful, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much deeper.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently stated, money can’t really buy luck.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which was brightened by the interaction as a friend.
Joey’s and Chandler’s frequent humor, moments of watching football in pleasant seats, and Ross’s search for Rachel – all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even though they often stop to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone care, it explained to me: “My listening role for people who feel depressed and are in danger of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old use "I'm going to deal with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when speaking openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that come to my mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective external status via the phone can help people in the moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the entirely newly designed bouquets to celebrate the day, why don’t you take your friends to a drink at Central Perk?
Or even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what kind of difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his encounter with Malmö.
Di Maria meets at her debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who drove the French champion on the road, but then they missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her predecessor as Cavani achieved a headball gate in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they not only strive to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but also to improve on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic that was missing chances before the gate. He was later exchanged in the game against his hometown team and against the association with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League. That's why it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause problems to our opponents and relax back, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I’m sorry we didn’t get one or two more gates yet.”
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned in one of three changes to the Paris team, which on the weekend could hold a 2:2 uncertain on its own against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing storm was named the man who could take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he denounced why he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before finishing well through Johan Wiland to the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who struck Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field raised a heavy opponent.
But besides a shooting by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed through Kevin Trapp's footsteps in the 34th minute, they took little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself, sometimes, with some mistakes and bad decisions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, at no less than five attempts, was left alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani used him after restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his co-player into the game, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic, who transformed Di Maria into a rotation, which was passed by Wiland in the 52th minute on the foot.
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan achieved its sixth season tower after Ibrahimovic had captured a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi opened a door at the end.
Malmö’s coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last champion league game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which has not the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Get out of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss-based mining riese Glencore, affected by falling raw materials, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a sale of shares as part of its huge debt settlement plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new stocks worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, struggles with a decline in raw materials prices as China’s economic decline presses demand and devastates markets.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencore’s share rate to the top of the London Stock Exchange at the early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pens on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week $2.5 billion stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to forgive about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
The concerns about long-term growth in China have reduced iron prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.

The latest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on September 25 and responds to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state-of-the-art after the two heads of state have conducted bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will give us the opportunity to expand American-China cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time President Obama and President Xi will give us the opportunity to tackle areas of divergence constructively," the statement added.
XI, whose first visit was announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a series of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber spying and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440-PS sports cars borrowed and driven to scratch
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and put out a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway there was bad awakening.
A company in the countryside of Gotha can meet the dream and once borrow and drive a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 PS.
This is what a 29-year-old from the Gotha district did.
At the A 71 in Arnstadt, the dream was then out and passed.
The 29-year-old lost control over the sports car, jumped on a wet track into the slider and went into the guide board.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 shift to FC Bayern
Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
The FC Bayern was apparently shortly before the Spanish Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champions, two times European champions, one time the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with the brand Xavi now tells him that he was already before the 2008 EM before he went to Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
“Madrid won everything, we didn’t,” he said.
This was also the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer from Bayern."
"Roumeigge wanted to have me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
But the change did not succeed.
And today, the decisive man is working for the German record champion Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bavarian's 2008/2009 game would run with Xavi?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinal of the Champions League against the Bavarians over the entire distance on the rain, disabled the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the Royal Class Triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she would not be needed behind the cults.
During a Sunday Night of HBO’s Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown broke out when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives as regards a black protagonist in the project’s selected script.
“When we talk about diversity, then you do it when occupying the film, not when occupying the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded shocked, with offended infidelity, and shouted "Hey! Wow. Okay," when The Martian's actress' comments confirmed.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the show’s finalists.
"I would like to urge people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a nut beaten by her white container.
Dear White People’s producer, Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, committed themselves to the right to directed the film; Damon responded that their directed can “at the end give us something we don’t want.”
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded over Damon’s comments before misunderstanding.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger on the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that is so WEISS that it hurts."
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved the country’s effect and prompted lawmakers and authorities to prohibit discriminatory practices against colorful content.
In February, the singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their significance.
Recently, Black Lives Matter’s leaders have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hatred group.
“The network Black Lives Matter is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, Damon was announced that he was on a list of entertainers, producers and media possibilities invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' is the first champion
Profi athlete and service assistance Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just finished its seventh season, had never experienced a competitor who could complete all stages of his barrier course.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, succeeded in the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75-foot long climb in 30 seconds.
Britten ended the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the staggering phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero ended this challenge three seconds faster, making it the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!Messages after the hard-concerning victory, still under the shock over the win of the Grand Prix of $1 million.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never earned more than $10,000 or had to live,” Isaac E! said about his amount of money.
So suddenly... like I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, although he was the first to finish the parcours at all, did not receive any awards.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"When there is more than one finalist, that one gets it with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he receives great gratification.
I don't think he's going to make any shit about it.
He's just so happy to do what he's done.
He received many awards from fans.
He's a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I am happy that it is Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, which will start the turning work in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers Going to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously, they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers were reduced to their role as a spoiler, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The twins lost a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros game for the second American League Wildcard square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to catch over a large portion of the second half of the season.
"Every victory is fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-picturer Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to finish this year,” Simon said.
It is hard to throw in the bullpen of each game, and therefore I want to get into the game completely focused.
The designed tiger hit Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's well wrapped the slaughterwood," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (schlag training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he put it directly into the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh innings, the twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy confessed Wall, the only man he faced, before designed Rookie striker Miguel Sano, who entrissed a two-run to the right hand Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the finishing round at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe into a double play.
It was the 27th leading in the Major League that Plouffe hit a double play this season.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the nineth innings, Wall achieved a double RBI against the closer of the tigers Bruce Rondon and achieved the level of 5-4.
The right hand, however, came to Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an unmovable Phil Hughes to start the game.
The tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, which had been deleted from the injured list before the game, after he had missed more than a month due to a backyard.
“Obviously not the beginning I wanted,” Hughes said, “but I felt better when I got off and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After receiving the Leadoff Battery first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who managed a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez achieved his 0-21 success series with the runners in the score position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers added in the second, achieved a One-Out Double by Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single by Center Field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"It was a big hit," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he caught the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, and did not achieve any points in the third inning until he was replaced by the reliever right hand A.J.Achter.
In Hughes, there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Remarks: RHP tigers Anibal Sanchez was dismissed due to a injury to the spine.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder destruction, is intended to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be deleted from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a breakdown in the right link.
Tigers and Twins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are going to be in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people in it will then be lodged in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city Wiesbaden reported on Wednesday night.
It estimated that there were 450 to 750 refugees.
Several sports halls in the Hessian country capital have been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stay there.
They are then distributed to other municipalities.
Only in the last ten days, according to the government presidency responsible for the first recording, 7,500 people arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency accommodations in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The leader of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria an opportunity.
“I believe that the decisive thinking of military action options should not take place without Germany,” he said.
He proposed to the European States “collective views”.
Four years ago, it was glad that the valley had passed through a military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing in front of our home door," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls south and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday night in the Austrian TV ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also sent no refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
As regards an agreement that Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there have already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and German representatives.
She did not call specific numbers and referred to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees arrived from Hungary to Austria through the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann requested a special summit for the next week, together with several other EU heads of state and government.
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls.
So far, the EU countries have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis.
The EU Interior Ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of additional 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22).
Given the strong level of refugees in Germany, the union wants to support the countries in the first recruitment and distribution of people.
The federation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of meetings with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor Hall in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will also fight this.
But whoever does not have a stay perspective can’t stay in Germany either.
This view has been expressly shared in the round.
The Chancellor emphasized that the state as a whole must now deal with a "real force" effort.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced to shut down the border with Romania with a bunch.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungarian wants to prevent Schlepper from searching for ausweich routes over Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said about the planned new border zone.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the lap.
According to eye-witness reports, thousands of other migrants went on the way to the Greek border.
Space sonda "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice cream of the Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean rises.
This includes researchers from observations of the space sonde "Cassini".
Therefore, the moon lightly blows around the ring planets on its track.
Although this bulb movement is small, but still too big for a constantly fixed heaven body, it is said in a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the Icarus magazine.
It has long been known that under the ice ceiling of Enceladus there must be liquid water.
As a result, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes on the South Pole of the Saturn moon, spitting water steam and ice particles, feeding the so-called e-ring of the Saturn.
At least in the South Pole, there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at the time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama misses 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must resign for about a month on the offensive warrior Valdet Rama.
A survey found an adector injury in the 27-year-old, the association reported.
Rama had complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Lion, the diagnosis means "previously four weeks of forced pause".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a heroic loss."
"Of course, we have to think about now," said Sports Director Necat Aygün of the "Image" schedule in view of the possible commitment of a unified professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was active in Belgium and was previously under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the possibility to demonstrate his ability."
Torjager Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week after his brain shooting.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player will start running training.
Okotie had been injured in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) during a severe collision on the head.
On the contrary, he remained without a serious blasphemy.
No Diet Fruit - Mangos contains lots of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his narrow line is often advised by them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sugar.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they include B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Mangos mainly contain a lot of vitamin A and its pregrade beta-carotine.
Anyone who eats the fruits supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When purchasing, mangos should not be too soft or too solid and smell pleasantly.
The shade color alone does not say anything about how mature the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet meals.
A mango, however, also gives a special note of heritage dishes.
It milds the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicoree and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb, and wild.
The U.S. package service UPS provides up to 95000 aids for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS reported on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being searched.
Last year, UPS had increased its staff for the holiday season by 95,000 aids.
Due to the growing online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making plans for the Christmas business since last year.
2013 late delivery had introduced harsh criticism to the package services.
The first flock, then the second cold front
In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alpine northern side of the Føhn, as Meteos Switzerland reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night to Thursday, the føhn is partially blowing with storm intensity through the føhntals.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a significant cold front crosses us, bringing powerful rainfall, wind bows and temperature drops.
According to MeteoNews, Switzerland is currently on the front side of an extensive deep-pressure region over the British islands in a powerful Southwest flow.
On the north side of the Alps breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday.
As a consequence, the føhn in the føhn valleys with bows from 60 to 100 km/h, united and partially in the urner country also with more than 100 km/h.
The føhn can, in fact, move to the adjacent middle country, and even on the mountains, orphans of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday storm feathers at summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture begins to grow on the Alpine sidehang.
Here is a rain that lasts until Thursday night.
In sum, the Alps have to be calculated in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter, which has already fallen large amounts of rain in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the føhn is out of the air, as a result, a cold front rolls out with a strong, partially large-scale rain from the West to the East over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind cools up strongly to storm, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days are present in the north of autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, on the contrary, in the south it will be sunny and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther-Platz
Almost 500 years after the reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of municipal President Ignazio Marino, a unnamed place in the park was baptized on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as "German theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome just next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, a priest of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Pope for centuries as a minority were often able to live their faith only in the hidden.
With the place in a symbolic way it is visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held himself as a young Augustinemanch about the year round 1510/11 for a few months in Rome.
He then considered the city as a deceased bible of sin.
His negative impressions might have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then initiated the division of the evening church with his thesis against the dismissal trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the golden crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was the word at the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who formulated his entirely personal interpretation of Bible stories on paper and linens in 150 motives.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but that is not in any way equivalent to "loving" images.
On the contrary, adapted to the subject, this may seem quite dark.
About three years Otmar Old has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a subjective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the "Books of All Books".
There are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as crossroads, crying, commands, or our father.
So he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing with his theological direction as well as to the Kettler publishing with his focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has been confronted with the respective Bible points based on painting.
He has interpreted the Bible points chosen by Otmar Alt and thus translated into current relationships today.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are incorporated between the original Bible citat by Martin Luther and each one of the artists who formulate his entirely personal thoughts about the respective situation.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
This allows the 75-year-old equally double a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimity.
Emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lord Huter Order.
"Then the education has happened once with the pipestock," recalled Otmar Alt.
“I have tried to do this to be able to endure me with the Lord’s Father.”
His second concern is to help the art in fast-living time become more prominent: “The perception of images is characterized by advertising today, and that is sound.
Symbolics are depressed there.
Artists have a different desire and willingness to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
“In this regard, I am a dinosaur.”
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "invade" themselves in the pictures, to let them act on themselves, to discover and feel what power they have: "The image seeks its opposite."
Klaus Altepost appeared on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible at the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "as always" being a lover of Otmar's Art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old has not taken care of the Bible fully, but the most important and mysterious topics chosen for him.
“It wasn’t an eye-altitude cooperation,” Altepost says, “it’s about the pictures that the text just explains.”
For Hans Möhler, the Lutheran publisher, this work is an invitation to “deep down his life and find freedom.”
Otmar Olds images speak for Möhlers both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and lens paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for the BMX train
Plans made, space found, companies assigned, modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BMX railway was finished again.
Forests in politics and administration were provided for Verdruss, especially for the residents who did not want to dulce the rail.
So hills displaced, searching for new place - now with formal planning and application for construction authorisation.
The approval will be made in October, and the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to communicate it to the Committee on Children and Youth.
“I hope that something visible will happen this year,” she said.
It should then be started without "other memory break" with the work at the former hall bath.
DFB Increased Refugee Engagement
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga will make a clear sign on the weekend.
Football responds to the situation in Germany and ensures politics help in addressing the upcoming problems.
“I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the reunification.”
"In principle, no one can say, it's nothing about me, I have nothing to do with it."
"It needs to be interested in taking this issue into account," DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach said.
At an annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I will be at the Chancellor on Wednesday and meet there with Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and Chancellor."
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he said.
Football can and want to help.
But the crucial changes must be made by politics.
The German football team therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Over the Egidius Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," Niersbach said at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal allies also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they will wear the inscription "We Help - #refugees welcome" on the left trikotärmel instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help, where and how they can," Leverkusens Sports Chief Rudi Völler of the "Image" Timeline, and described the project as "self-comprehension".
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one should be watching away."
"We can, no, we need to use our radiation power, our influence, and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
In the EM qualification game against Hungary on Friday, the Women's National Team invites 100 refugees to Hall/Sale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing firms have launched their own projects in their locations is great.
It is also great that smaller and smaller associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for welcome," which we have issued, will live in football.
“That’s of great importance,” he said.
This and next year, the association, together with the DFB election and the federal government, will provide EUR 300,000 for the integration of refugees each.
“The associations have already revoked the entire sum for 2015,” Niersbach said.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
Bill McDermott, the chief executive of Europe's largest software company, has lost his left eye, according to several reports by a collapse in early July.
At the crash on the stairs at his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water that he weared in his left hand after midnight, the "Economic Week" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, he's been powerless, he's got out of the street - that he told us last week," cited the "WiWo" SAP founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott can follow his work.
"In early October, we meet before the supervisory meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and "fully working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "South-Germany newspaper" (Tuesday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software companies.
“I am full of SAP there, full of my job.”
"Obviously, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott said.
McDermott typically hangs between Germany and the United States, but since summer he has no longer been in the German SAP central in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can happen."
“It’s important to get up again when you’re falling.”
McLaren Replacement Pilot Magnuses Except Fighting ...
Magnusssen tweeted an appropriate photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he fell from the wheel.
He is therefore as little as a reserve driver for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally collapsed.
The national player will miss the table leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 p.m.).
"We can't attack him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be again at the Bundesliga Cup against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach opened: “We expect a return from him to training on Friday.”
Given the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stem leaf on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the door guard position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of the tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football manager praised the world champion.
However, whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future, Tuchel has left open.
Highly likely he will also dispute the second party.
The research statement by Coplayer Reus that the final input for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, considers midfielder Julian Weigl to be understandable: "This is not so wrong with Marco."
“I think we have a good chance to take the title.”
Robot cars: Government wants a leading role for Germany
Germany will, according to the federal government’s will, be a technological predecessor in the change of the car.
The Federal cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the IAA automotive show about a "new mobility age".
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stain, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the topic with his officials from the G7 countries, which also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband construction and a rapid transition to digital hearing aid.
In order to test new techniques, a test track is currently created on the highway 9 in Bavaria.
To ensure that the driver is "not charged with any additional liability risks", the federal government wants to "revise the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Germany, for example, aims internationally to increase the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 hours kilometers.
The federal government also wants to make a change to the Vienna Convention, which is intended only for people as drivers so far.
When driving automated, the car is increasingly driving, the driver becomes more and more passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data quickly in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, high-automatic driving will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "expected only far after 2020".
The value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and high-automatic driving functions at the location in Germany estimates the authors of the study for 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the truck can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," SPD traffic policymaker Sören Bartol said.
The question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars still look skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey from the Forsa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of the test organization Dekra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe autonomous driving cars will be implemented in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33% in the United States.
Without it, the drivers in Germany are not ready to fully rely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a collection of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give control over all the roads.
On the highway, it could be 15 percent in flowing traffic, but 45 percent in dust.
The good of every quarter would not leave the car control under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to be single at the title matches from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision is to be made no later than September 22.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time to a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite," single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov said.
The Hamelner, who leads the seat list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo also missed at that time, and we became European champions."
"We should focus on this," the World Ranking Fifth said.
The English national football player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg.
During the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was encountered in a tackling by Héctor Moreno and exchanged after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a rail breach in the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Pigsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a growing figure grid cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich about his work.
The highlights: screenshots that thanks to video projections look terrifyingly human.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became Madonna’s outfit to become the great star of the fashion scene - and so he put men in shirts.
“I can’t say today that I am the child of the skin couture terrible because I have white hair.”
"In the past it was shine, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Citizenship on the Launch Stage), which is seen in the Art Hall of the Hypo-Culture Foundation on September 18th, it is a luck that the fashion maker has changed his initial refusal attitude to a view on his person.
In fact, he was against it, because, “For me, a show sounded a little after death,” he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been done in Montreal and Paris Station in Canada.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Art Hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibitions give an insight into the hardly overlooking work of the man who wrote the fashion history without having ever completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which a lot of effort has been operated: for example, to freeze the puppies, a stylist was engaged in itself.
14 tons of material the makers have travelled to Munich, according to the information of the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, another special shark was involved: a leather-hose outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a little different," Gaultier said.
Gaultiers' old Teddy is also available at the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first, sharp, fashionable hiking attempts.
When he was a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he weared his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a puppy, his parents wouldn't allow him.
Designing fashion he later learned himself.
He broke fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Then I bought them, of course.
For his first model view, he couldn’t pay the models.
They couldn't get anything, but they were able to keep the clamps.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener top as fashion niche
Earlier, it went into and around the long sticking machines to make meters.
The coated fabrics and tops were produced in large amounts for customers who, for example, continued to process them to covers and garments.
This alone doesn’t work anymore today,” explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of the Fashion Head of Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener top, fashion played a larger role, then was undermined by the domestic textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: tops in jewelry, accessories like pockets and regional wear.
Mostly, the so-called Vintage mode, which refers to past style eras, constitutes an increasing order potential.
Anyone who does not serve niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
They already make half of all orders with us.
Fashion Spice Plauen is a member of the Industry Association of Plauener Spice and Stickers, along with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, about 80 percent of the sales have been broken down.
Private professional stores and also wholesale are almost no longer.
Our products are hardly reaching the customer in this way.
Today, the massware is much cheaper in the Asian area and almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports are weakened, currently to Russia and the United States.
There are enough reasons for new ways.
The industry is also trying to point out by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explained: “Since this year, we have run a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially tolerant.”
Reinhardt added: "This also applies to the materials used."
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snowberg outdoors of the Western Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in stickers and tops.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension field between the latest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer stem.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball cap.
The machine sticks small bullets at some places.
Bianca Hallebach Kruße, the Plauen Gold Carrier, inspired her: “I couldn’t start with traditional plauen tops before.”
Now she uses the snowball head for her jewelry.
In an open process, it characterizes the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener top – young and old,” says Reuters.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memory piece.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Plauener top.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney is still watching a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, it’s not about a new film, but about a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical girl.
It’s about Nanny’s experience with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.

Xi wants to open the economy broader for the world
The economy has to open up broadly outwardly to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group that was commissioned to lead the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business foundation strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Headquarters for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and promoting reforms will lead to new vibration and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a series of directives, including a negative list of regulation of market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of public enterprises (SOE), private capital, and transfer of the resident media system.
According to the statement, a negative list is set up identifying sectors and companies that are not in question for investments.
The system is tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it plays a greater role in the market in allocation of resources, ensuring a legally stated business environment and making the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also attract controls on the powers conferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how they run their businesses.
The statement also said China would allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open government-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy against foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of attorneys to exercise their activities and apply professional judges and attorneys was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double the limit of cheesefish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for cheesefish in large fishing, thus increasing a significantly higher dose of nerve poisoning to consumers.
Consumer Foodwatch, which presents a corresponding EU paper, criticized the plans: “The risks and side effects of lack of industrial and environmental policy are being transferred to pregnant women and young children with full growth,” said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poisoning for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as hae or sword fish for "economic policy" reasons, will be raised from one to two milligrams of cheese silver per kilogram of fish.
However, large fishes are already so severely burdened with cheese silver that approximately 50 per cent of fishing should not be sold on the basis of the remaining limit values.
After the duplication of the limit values, only 14.5% would be unselling.
In return for this locking, Foodwatch says the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of cheese per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "trick" because smaller fringe fish, such as carpenters, are mostly so lowly loaded that they comply with the planned maximum values already today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide reduction operation that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt said.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal that is strongly enriched through the food chain, especially in robbery fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "almost small amounts can cause, especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system."
However, on its homepage, the Federal Ministry of Environment states that a "health threat to the general population" is unexpected.
Quecksilber comes mainly through coal burning into the environment.
The German coal power plants, according to a written report by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, issued more than six tonnes of coal silver per year, two-thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The concentration of cheese silver in fish for example in Elbe, Rhine and Donau has "permanently and extensively exceeded", the "speel" had cited from the paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings against peasant silver in fish were already one of the most common health risks reported in the EU warning system RASFF.
