Members of the Wales Office are afraid to look stupid
Some representatives have been confused with the proposal that their value should be exchanged by MWP, i.e. by a Member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was the beginning of the plan to turn the name of the representative into the Wales parliament.
Members of the Representative are concerned, regardless of the party, that the change may cause them to be the subject of an injury.
According to a representative of a working party, the group is worried that the name is "written with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales, twp in Wales means stupidity and pwp means cake.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group is regarded as a "open mind", but notes that the MWP is a short vocabulary to a stupid word.
In Wales, the w-book is stated in this respect similar to the Yorkshire English u-book.
The Commission stated, "Of course, the final decision of the nomenclatures described by the members of the representatives belongs to its own members."
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 grants the representative authority to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion review on proposals that the appointment of a representative as the Wales parliament enjoyed extensive support.
The Commission welcomes the WMP or abbreviation of the Wales parliament as representatives, but the MWP option is mostly supported in the public opinion analysis.
Members of the Representative are obviously proposing alternative nomenclatures, but the lack of consensus can cause President Elin Jones, who is expected to amend the bill within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the functioning of the representatives, such as the rules on the loss of the representative and the formation of the committee system.
In the legislative process, the members of the representative may vote for their last vote on the nomenclature to be called.
Macedonians will go to the electoral unit in a referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to the "Northern Macedonian Republic".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long disputed neighbourhood with Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long repeated that the name of the northern neighbour is practically a regional requirement for its area, and has repeatedly resisted its efforts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will not vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider that the change in the name is simply a price to pay for membership between the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's watches are calming when Harlem's churches live in difficult times
“The elderly people I have talked to say that there was a bar or church in every street corner before,” Adams says.
"Now there's no one."
He said that the loss of bars is understandable.
He said, "The conversation with people has changed."
“The bars are no longer the neighborhood’s common living rooms to which people meet regularly.”
With regard to the churches, he is worried that the sale of assets does not stand as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to their departure."
He added that churches can be replaced by houses and apartments inhabited by people are not those who would support the remaining sanctuary of the neighbourhood.
"It is unlikely that most of the people who buy homes from these buildings will be white," he says, "and so they will last the day when these churches close their doors definitively because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were constructed by the White Churches before Harlem became the Black Church of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins in a decade later.
In the 1930s, the original White Methodist Society moved away.
Nearby, the church of black people acquired its own building.
St Martins took his position under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, leading a boycott against the 125th Street traders of Harlem's main trade union against the hiring or overthrow of these opposed blacks.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building, and when the congregations of Johnson planned to rebuild it, they set up a tower-roll.
Pastor David Johnson, the father of Johnson’s son and follower in St. Martins, proudly called the tournament “agriculture watches”.
In July, a tournament player called it "cultural treasure" and "unsubstituted historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first tournament game played by the world's black music, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to call a larger tournament to the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martins hasn't replaced her.
St. Martins has developed a complex sweat in recent months to contribute to the church’s leaders and archaeologists, on the other hand, awarded by the archaeologists and careermen.
In July, Sakhasti, the Board of Directors of the Church, wrote to the Hip-hop that the Hip-hop "sought to pay the costs" for the chassis, even though the hip-hop had not participated in the hiring of the architects and careers sent by the Hip-hop.
Some congregations complained about lack of transparency in relation to the hip-hop.
Hai damaged 13-year-old hummer driver in California
The officials tell him that he attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him by killing hummeres on the opening day of the hummeres in California.
The attack occurred at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before the evening.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he and his friends shouted about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's crying out. He and a group of others sounded to the boy to help this water.
Hammel first told her to think that the boy was just excited to catch a hummer, but then realized that he shouted, “I was kicked out!”
I'm thrown out!"
When he arrives at the boy, Hammel says he noticed that all of this sunshine had been broken open.
"I shouted to everyone out of the water: in the water is hae!" Hammel added.
The boy was flying to a Rady's children's hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The beneficial species is not known.
My spiritual rescue captain Larry Giles said in the media that the area had been detected a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be harmless species.
Giles added serious injuries to the top of the victim.
The officials closed the beaches from Casablado Ponto Beach Ecinitas to Swami for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty care industry
Sainsbury’s challenges Boots, Superdrugin and Debenham’s beauty care departments with specialized consultants.
This is a significant move to the UK's beauty sector worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although the sale of fashion and home goods is weakening. Larger beauty departments are tested in 11 stores across the country and successfully expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty-care products are placed as supermarkets are trying to fill out the room previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household assets.
Sainsbury's tells the 3,000 double product range of beauty care products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific regions like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also restart its Boutique jewelry range. In the future, most of the products will be vegan-friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will try to rent stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oaki in Birmingham later this year.
Transferring online shopping and food shops to small one-time shops in the neighbouring stores will force supermarkets to invent new attraction for customers.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that shops will look more and more from goods when the supermarket chain fights against cheap retail shops like Ald and Lidl by adding services and other than food products.
After purchasing both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat stores. The company tells this to promote the sale of food and make purchases profitable.
Supermarket failed to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments in its previous company.
Sainsbury’s experienced a joint venture with Boots in the early 20th century, but cooperation ended up disputes about how the revenue of pharmacies in supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows the company’s trade in which Sainsbury’s sold its 281 pharmaceutical business to the Lloyds Pharmacy chain owned by Celesio for £125 million three years ago.
The company told Lloyds that it was part of a plan that expanded the range of luxury skin care products in four stores with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed our beauty care components’ appearance and mood to improve customer experience.
We have also contributed to special training employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand selection meets all our needs and attractive environments, and our convenient location makes us a convincing shopping site that challenges the traditional way to make shopping."
Peter Jones "in his own way" Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones leaves "in peace" when TV drinker Holly Willoughby withdraws 11 million pounds from a deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new agreements with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home food and housing brands for Truly.
Two companies are compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old starter of this Morning program announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was angry with Dragons Den by attracting Peter Jones from their profitable lifestyle business in the last moment. He is now planning to focus on his new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "in peace" on Tuesday at a regular meeting at Jones's business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star had admitted that his new deal worth 1.5 million pounds would not leave enough time for their home foods and accessories.
The company was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was estimated to double Willoughby’s assets of 11 million pounds.
A 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he left Trul, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to a source, “Truly was Holly’s most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his execution for the next two decades.
His departure decision has left all the surprises under power.
No one believed the events on Tuesday so close to the publication.
Marlow’s headquarters have a warehouse full of products waiting for sale.”
This Morning drink is one of Britain’s most uncertain stars, and according to experts, it can cause millions of losses to the company due to the product tracking, including everything from candles to candles and clothing to home products, without mentioning the delay of publication.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones for ten years with Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and a 52-year-old Jones moved to president in March.
Pairs stay together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be replaced by M&S' new brand sender and replaced Ant McPartlin's I'm A Celebrity program.
The source near Jones said last night, "We didn't comment on his business."
Let's talk and then we fell in love.
He laughed at the criticism of his comments on the media, some of which should be inadequate for the president, and his positives towards the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much to you?
Trump said the voice of the "Newscover".
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in seeing him again after Trump’s first July meeting was an important step towards North Korea’s nuclear crisis.
However, nuclear negotiations have failed.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North will not see a "responsive reaction" from the U.S. to the early resignation of North Korea.
He stated that the United States would continue its sanctions to keep pressure on.
Trump had a much more optimistic view.
"With North Korea, it's going great," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such a great relationship.”
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the tests have been stopped, the loads have been helped to be free and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style as he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to reach 10,000 more by this board, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said.
Indonesian tsunami and inheritance destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In the post-advertising of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required by international aid was not declared, although about 10 percent of Lombok’s population had remained homeless.
“In some cases, they have unfortunately made very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so the situation is slightly challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children forms a traveling group, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work on the field.
The reporter of the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation of Palu to see whether international organizations were allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia is still unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account regularly repeated earthquakes.
While Acehi is built in tsunami juices, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The return was likely lost due to the tsunami warning symptoms missing human lives, although the warning was valid.
Travelling between many islands in Indonesia is challenging in the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is on the way to Pal, but it takes at least three days before reaching a new area of accident.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia’s past infrastructure the central point of his election campaign, and he has spent money on improving rail and railways.
However, some government has suffered financial disadvantages, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Some pressures also increase the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country have taken the older form of religion.
Christians and Muslims have visited street fights on fifty-five vessels, pillows and nuts, as well as other initial weapons. This has led to more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hit late score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge was rescued Saturday from Liverpool's defeat in the election after painting at Stamford Bridge in London for 89 minutes.
Sturridge received a feed from Xherdan Shaqir 27 distance from Chelsea's painting when his team was in the loss of painting.
He moved the ball to the left before he frightened the collapse towards the back.
The jump jumped over the high penalty area towards the right top.
Finally, the ball dropped over the Kepa Arrizabalagan and fell into the network.
“I just tried to play myself to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"So I approached Kanten, took one touch, and threw out too much."
Chelsea held the match in the middle of 1-0 after Eden Hazard painted in Belgium in 25 minutes.
In the situation, the Blues box gave Mateo Kovacic a stand-alone, before wheeling to escape near the midfield and asked to Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic played in the middle of a quick wall-breaking field.
Then he released Hazard to the sanctuary area with a tremendous passage.
Hazard escaped the defence and hit Liverpool’s left foot with Alisson Becker to the back.
Liverpool will meet at the Champions League in Naples on Wednesday at 15 a.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami deaths rise to 832 deaths
The Indonesian Disaster Agency reported early Sunday that the number of earthquakes and tsunami deaths rose to 832.
The agency’s reporter Sutopo Purwo told the press that many had been injured by the ruins of broken buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit on Friday and raised up to six meters of scary waves.
The palms of the Romahtane buildings spread over 380,000 inhabitants to the city of Palu.

Parliament's Cromwell Patsask became part of a history rewriting package
Marriage of Pats would be a reasonable right, given that his own fanatic puritanees destroyed the cultural and religious objects of England as well as the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell sequence described Crick's proposal as "typeryde" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell series, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate about the removal of pots would make a painting table of the pot Oliver Cromwell at the front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or execute the English Civil War iconic class.
The wrong Cromwell might have suffered from the works of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent description of Cromwelist reveals the 19th-century opinions and is a historical proof of the character that many still consider to be praiseworthy.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Most people, although more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, caused by the monarchy.
Is it then the exact description of the topic a topic of a continuous historical debate?
At least it is certain that the disputes in the mid-19th century have demonstrated the later development of our nation, and Cromwell, on the other hand, has to identify a character representing the other part of this distribution.
In addition, his achievement as a state manager deserves gratitude and remembrance.”
The killing of a Chinese farmer's life
Local media reports that the farmer attacked and killed a pig on a tower in South China.
The body of a man named Yuan was found near Liupanshui tower in Guizhou. The man's arm had broken up and he was on his blood, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
The pig is prepared to vaccinate pigs in the pig on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qingha Province, China.
He and his cousin traveling with his neighbour from Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on a tower.
His nephew found him dead the next morning, and he noticed that the door of the near pig was open.
In the sea he said that he saw a great herd, whose mouth was in blood.
According to the news, a criminal investigation confirmed the life of a 250-kilo-white farmer.
The Guiyang Evening News magazine tells the cousin named "Wu" that "my cousin's legs were bloody and calm".
The photo of the supervisory camera shows the grandfather coming to the tower to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killing pig belonged to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the tower’s leaders told Evening News that pigs were trapped behind the lock so that it wouldn’t harm others when the police collected evidence on the scene.
The Yuan family and the Tori authorities will be informed of the negotiating compensation for the death penalty.
Pigs are known to have attacked people before, even though they are rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband in their countryside in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, nearly 300 pounds of pigs climbed against this tractor from a Walesian farmer until his wife managed to trouble the animal’s path.
The Oregon farmer was eating his pigs in 2012. After the event, the farmer living in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that although pigs are usually not aggressive, the taste of blood can act as "small."
"They're just cuts.
They are like little children, very cute, and their purpose is not to hurt them.
You just have to respect them properly,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains bring wide hardcoats to the U.S. Southwest
Hurricane Rosa is predictablely weakened when moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rosa brings floods to the north of Mexico and to the south of the United States.
The wind speed was 38 meters per second, or one-class hurricane, from Sunday morning to the east coast, and it was located 620 kilometers south-east of Punta Eugenio in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific sea is formed by a low level, which goes eastwards towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa arrives on Monday to California as a tropical storm, it begins to blow deep tropical moisture toward the north of the United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical moisture that interacts with low weights will form a wide range of rain areas in the next few days for lunch.
Locally 25-100 millimeter rainfall causes dangerous turmoil and potentially earthquakes in the air.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 mm rainfall per hour in certain landing areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For some areas at lunch and in particular in Arizona, it is expected to rain up to 50-100 millimeters.
Rankings are possible and conditions can quickly weaken due to tropical rain breakdown.
In the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the foot in the desert.
Rankings can turn the cannons to the flow of the rivers, and the storms cause local windstorms and flying dust.
The nearby low pressure area brings local hardcoats to the coastal areas of Southern California.
More than 10mm rain is possible, causing low waste flows and dissolving you.
It would be the first rainfall in the region.
The tropical rainfalls will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday until the rainfall expands during Monday and Tuesday.
The rankings spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last for a whole Wednesday.
In October, in the United States, there is a wide range of heatings at temperatures in the Arctic region, but the tropical remains quite warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature evaporations at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, there is an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sundays.
There is a temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines.
The delayed summer temperature will continue to grow and expand in the next few days.
It is widely expected to be warm in the middle and eastern parts of the U.S. at the temperature of +26 degrees from the southern levels to the eastern parts.
In New York, the temperature may be painful on Tuesday to +26 degrees, which would be approximately 4 degrees warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, in the eastern part of the United States there are good possibilities for higher average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaug's hearings
More than 20 million people watched a broadcast of six television channels on Tuesday, where Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who was accused of sexual crime in the 1980s, gave a fascinating witness statement.
At the same time, the political situation continued to interrupt the broadcast by television companies in the last moment, saying that the FBI conducted a weekly investigation of charges on the basis of the agreement organized by Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh hit him and tried to swallow his clothes in high school.
Kavanaugh, in turn, issued a sentimental witness statement saying that he was 100% sure that this was not happening.
The viewers were more likely than Nielsen reported on Friday 20.4 million.
The company dropped the average of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The numbers of other channels sent to the occasion, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers in offices.
Some of the measurement ratios tell us that the reading corresponds to the number of viewers of the American football drop game or the Oscar industry.
According to Nielsen, the largest audiences of all television companies were Fox News Channel, whose opinion managers strongly supported the name of Kavanaug. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day’s consultation.
ABC was another 3.26 million viewer.
Nielsen told CBS that it was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After hearing, the interests were still high.
In the middle of the drama on Friday was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras described how the protesters shouted him on his way to the hearing of the Committee on Justice on Friday, and the republicans of the Maltese had previously announced that he would vote for Kavanaug.
CNN looked straight as he was standing on a minute's look down when he was flying.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," she said.
Flake said that she gave her office opinion and added before the lifts were closed, that she would have further information after hearing the committee.
Later, the cable and general ambassador networks sent directly when the Committee on Justice began to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate's plenary vote.
Nevertheless, Flake said he would only act in understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake convinced his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made his decision when he talked to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election had power because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough voices to approve Kavanaug without investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses in an interview with Sunday Times of critical people of political threats to Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In addition to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page, where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for a proposal that the UK and the EU would impose import duties on each other, "fully irrelevant".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson's suspect of the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in LSU for the 20-year-old Wayde Sims' death shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was arrested and sentenced to jail.
The officials published a video about Sims and Simpson's intercourse, in which the police reported Sims' loss of eyeglasses.
The police found glasses on the scene and told them they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB said.
Police tell him that he admitted that Wayde was shot in the interviews.
According to the journal Advocate, $3500,000 was placed for his warranty.
The East Baton Rougen municipality’s researcher published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a shooting in a niche.
The Agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Attack Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and residents of the region for the assistance of the investigation led by the arrest.
LSU Executor Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "exercise and execution of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU's.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 recordballs in the match last season.
LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday that he was "disturbed" and "disturbed" about Wayden's death.
"Always be afraid of something like this," Wayde said.
Firefighting crashes over Mexico City
The popocatepetl hill has reached the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Disaster Center urged citizens to stay away from the firefighter when the crater’s operation accelerated and during the day 183 gas and collapse were registered.
The center records grain and seeds several times.
In the social media, photos were published in Mexico City’s so-called Xochimilcon residential areas covering a thin coil floor of the cars.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in the activity of the mountain from 72 kilometers from the capital of the south, following a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
"Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan paradises take together before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six individuals were arrested on Saturday in a combination of demonstrators who benefit from independence and the noise police. Thousands participated in competitive demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote.
The police arrested a group of independent supporters who threw the police on eggs and dust paints, forming dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled with tourists.
Over the course of the day, the police were using their pumpkins to hold their shoes.
The unifications between the supporters of independence and the Unionist groups continued for several hours, shouting "no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the last "to live in Spain".
The local newspaper tells fourteen of the minors received in the demonstrations.
The tension remains in the region of independence profitable after a year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal, but which the Catalan paradis celebrates.
Voters elected with a clear majority of independence, although participation in the boycott vote was a low difference.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent gatherings last year when the police tried to stop voting in the votes across the region.
Independence supportive groups stayed out on Friday to prevent national police protests.
However, it was arranged, but it had to go on a second route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said there was no longer hope for Catalonia’s independence.
Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our life.
"I saw my parents crying for the joy of voting, but now we've been jeweled in their places," he says.
Last December's regional elections, but despite the vital gain of Catalonia's independence, the bulk of the parties that are profitable this year, many of the most well-known leaders are in a voluntary land crisis or are detained waiting for a trial from their involvement in the referendum to organize and follow it.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who pictured police for a profitable demonstration on his phone, says politicians on both sides of the lap dispute.
"Your order is shining all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders from nine years to the last year in the study, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"To be euro-elected is the best way to condemn the destruction and destruction of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.

Livingston won Rangers 1-0 in Mengan
Dolly Menga's first painting in Livingston ensures victory
The seriesist Livingston depicted Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard only a second loss in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox series.
Dolly Menga's painting was ultimately enough to win Gary Holt's team up to a second place with the Hibernians.
Gerrard's crew remained without the first guest winning of the season in the Premiership, next Sunday it will meet the Head of the Hearts Series, which is eight points above.
Rangers will meet in the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, however, continued to lose his pipeline in the series to measure six matches, and chief coach Holt hasn't lost once after being replaced by Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston lost places to the visitors who suffered from the lack of rain
The Holt team had to have long before the paint caused to Rangers bad difficulties in their directness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide. Next, Alan Lithgow moved to the landscape to Craig Halkett, but you controlled the ball.
The parents popularly gave the ball management to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate special situations.
An important painting came just this way.
Rangers caused a free flight to Livingston, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played Mengelle, where he was able to move the ball into the middle of the penalty area and finish it.
Rangers had until then held the ball, but confirmed that the home team would like to defend, and paint agent Liam Kelly failed to try.
The same pattern continued on the other half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Ranger's painter Allan McGregor hindered Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow managed the ball to overcome another special situation in Livingston.
The rainy concentrations in Livingston’s punishment area were constantly cleaned out, and two of the situations were required to be punished without a penalty - the Halkett-tacked exchanger, Glenn Middleton, and the hand-held ball.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni
Great performance and results from Livingston.
The team continued to overcome expectations and was excellent from each player late, continuing through the rising orders.
The game of the team and the crew have hardly changed its rise back to the highest level of the series. However, it must be recognized by the way he has strengthened the team after reaching.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great leader in leading excellently organized defence, holding Menga in the arms of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
Rangers missed ideas.
The team has sometimes appeared really well under Gerrard, but now remains far from his level of demand.
The last entry remained exhausted, and they managed to open the home team defense only once, this should act as a wake-up for Rangers, a series table's centerpiece.
Erdogan received a different reception in Cologne
The smile was sensitive and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a disputed visit to Germany by President Erdogan, which is aimed at repairing NATO allies relations.
There have been disputes both of human rights and press freedom and of Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented 25,000 supporters from meeting the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but nearly many supporters were gathered to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters - many of whom were Kurdish - also brought to their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect the sharing of opinions, and some German Turks greet him as a hero in the oppression of others.

Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in sleeplessness
The prison officials report that six prison guards were injured in a high-security prison injury.
The displacement began at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, and continues.
Tornado police have been brought to the place to calm down disturbances behind eight prisoners together in prison waters.
Police's small faces were treated at the scene.
A prison official said: "HMP Long Lartin has been sent to a specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated with their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that the police will take responsibility and they may have to spend more time behind the prisoners.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
The prisoner was reported to have been hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in prison, noise police were warned in October due to serious disturbances in which personnel were attacked with balloons.
Hurricane Rosa brings rigid threats to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dizziness areas can benefit)
There are rare tropical low pressures in Arizona, but that’s what’s happening at the beginning of the next week, when the remains of the Hurricane Rosa will move over the dining straw along with the risk of harshly decayed.
The National Weather Service has already provided a warning from heavy rains on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast of California and Uthai, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaffin, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, it will arrive on Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted on Twitter that "only ten tropical storms have maintained a tropical storm or low-speed state 300 kilometers away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane further 65 kilometers away from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the national hurricane center predict 50-100 millimeter rain. With the Mogolin harbour in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimeters.
In other regions of the dining area, including the middle rocky mountains and the Great Basin, you can actually get 25-50 millilitres, which can rain up to 100 millilitres.
Rosa rain may also be a blessing by testing dryness in the area, if there is no risk of harsh rainfall.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, some of the rain may also be useful because the dining room has suffered from severe dryness.
According to the U.S. Dryness Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme dryness, which is the second-largest class, according to weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa is on the way to the rise of California in Mexico.
Sunday morning Rosa’s location is 620 kilometers south of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia. It is then the strongest hurricane wind speed at 135 kilometers per hour. It moves north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it comes to cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a strong tropical storm on Monday evening or evening.
In some of Mexico’s rain may be severe and cause a significant flood.
"The Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southernern Southern
Rosa then continues its journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the Arizona border as a tropical low-cost on Tuesday morning, and from there it continues its journey through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday.
“The highest risks of the rose or its residues are associated with extremely severe rainfall in California’s neighbouring land, the relief in Sonora and the U.S. Southern Coast,” the National Hurricane Agency said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening turmoil and waste flows in the deserts, as well as in the mountainous regions.

Trump says Kavanaugh’s experienced Democratic Party is “explanatory and angry”
"My voice in favour of the judge of Kavanaugh is a vote against the unruly and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a Wheeling meeting in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh's Democratic Party suffered from "expression and anger" during his entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh proved before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual disturbance that had occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also proved to be in the hearing of his accusations.
The President said on Saturday "the Americans saw the Kavanaugh of excellence, nature and courage" that day.
"My voice in favour of strengthening the nomination of the judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most grateful legal opponents of our time with excellent seamen for public service," he told his West Virginia supporters.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaug as he talked about the importance of the Republican voting activism in the interim elections.
“We are from five weeks of the most important elections in our lives.
“I was not just a campaign, but a full campaign,” he said.
"So I'm going to fight everywhere for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats had taken the role of “answer and prevention”.
The older assistant of the Republican Party said to CNN that the first important vote in the Kavanaug appointment procedure is expected to be Senated by Friday at the latest.
In Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami hundreds of deaths, the number of deaths is expected to rise
The officials reported on Saturday at least 384 deaths of a large earthquake and tsunami strike on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, many of which dropped off the shore with huge waves.
At the festival held on the beach of the city, hundreds of people gathered on Friday, when even six meters of horrifying waves hit the beach’s nightlife.
The tsunami caused a 7.5-magnetic strong earthquake.
When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately when they left it victims,” said the spokesman of the BNPB, Purwo Nugroho in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, but it drove along with cars, wooden beams, houses, and hits all over the land," Nugroho says.
Some of the people survived the tsunami in their lives by kicking into trees, he says.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 center of Pal.
Atmospheric images published by the Catastrophe Agency appear to be a number of destroyed houses and shops, rotated and broken bridges and the mosque surrounding the water.
The following orders have been treated by the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT made a statement that on Friday, energy released in a huge earthquake corresponded to about 200 nuclear bombs falling into Hiroshima during World War II.
It is said that the countryside of a long and narrow valley of the city may have caused the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been broken down.
He told some of the dead bodies of ruined buildings found and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and damages could be greater than Palusta 300 kilometers to the northern coast, a Donggala region closer to the center of destruction.
“The communications are completely gone, and no information has been received from Dongguan,” says Nugroho.
According to the opinion of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because it didn’t tell the tsunami’s attack on Pallu, but the authorities said the waves had arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building is screaming rapidly to warn people who are close to tsunami in the street.
Only minutes later, a waterfall will hit the beach, which will take the buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the pictures.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a wide range of electricity breakthroughs that would break communications around Palu, which made it difficult to coordinate the rescue operations by the authorities.
The officials say that the army has begun to send assistance from Jakarta and other cities with transport machines, but the evacuated still need painfully food and other basic items.
The city airport is reopened only for assistance and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was invited to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami victims are more than 800.
The situation is really bad.
The staff of the World Vision Donga has been secured in the city of Palu, where they have been lodged in the interior of the office’s tent coverage. On their journey, they have led to the destruction scene, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of devastated houses,” he said.
The situation is really bad.
At the initiative of aid groups, some complained that foreign aid workers were prevented from traveling to Palau.
According to Indonesia's regulations, the finance, accessories and staff from abroad may only begin to flow after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a rural disaster," said spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross, Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can begin to receive international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made.”
When the other night, after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the missing friends and family members had hoped that their close relatives would be traded by the miracle of deviating the story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was raised from the sea.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been ruined for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian Independent Team, had trained two missing independent coaches for Asian kisses ending earlier this month.
The Roa Roa hotel was also injured by his students, says Mandagi.
"As a parent member of the conflict, I have my own emotional load," he says.
Gendon says that he has attempted to desperately reach the participants of the beach festival Please compete with WhatsApp messages after the news of the Roa Roa hotel was spread among the independent community.
However, after the messages she sent, only one gray sign appeared instead of two blues.
“It means that I understand that messages are not delivered,” he says.
The thieves spent $26,750 in addition to Newport on the Leve
The thieves took $26,750 from the Brink's guard movement on Friday morning when this was supplementing the Newport on the Leve, according to a Newport police report.
The driver had been in a vacuum cleaning and complementing banking machine in the entertainment center, detective Dennis McCarthy said in the newspaper.

Kanye West: Repeater Changes Name Ye
Kanye West will change the name Ye.
As he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The hahmo that was known before was Kanye West.”
Ye has been a 41-year-old West favorite name for some time, and she also used it as her eighth album released in June.
The change is made before his future appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
In the program, he replaces the singer Ariana Granden, who, according to the program's creator, withdraws from her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has a religious significance to him in addition to the shortening of his profession.
When I talked about the name of the album earlier this year with a radio shower Big Boy, West said, "He believes that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
“I’m you, we, and all of us.
It began from Kanye, which means the only one, and ended in a shorter form Ye - which just expresses the goodness, evil, confusion, and everything.
The album is mostly a reflection on who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rabbits that have changed his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year she announced her favourite names Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner JAY-Z has also removed and restored the bandwidth and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, promised that he would never use military power against civilians, and that the announcement was the 50th anniversary of the awards to students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that he would "not use an army to destroy the Mexican people."
Assassinists shot a peaceful protest on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people during which the left-wing student movements were rooting in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised support for young Mexicans by providing monthly study support and opening more free public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities for young criminals.
U.S. should double the funding for research
The U.S. should double the funding used to investigate the workforce when China increases its business, says Google, Microsoft, and Apple, a funder and a non-profit, Kai-Fu Lee.
Although the United States lacks a formal action strategy, the U.S. administration's communications on the use of various parts of the U.S. government had preceded the opinion.
In the meantime, China has already presented its plan last year: it will endeavor to be a leading development developer by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget of the conduct research, considering that other countries are so many behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of the conduct," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the probability that the next significant achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Leen’s book “The Great Powers of the Work: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China’s most important work companies named Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed a system of operations at Carnegie Mellon University, which hit the highest Othello player in the United States, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research as well as CEO of Google’s Chinese functions.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. administration’s previous technological goals, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next to be organized to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. scientists have worked hard to get public aid.
"Academic influencers don't take China, but big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the top universities to work in the field of work.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to improve its efforts.
"I think that the doctorates should automatically grant green cards," he said.
China’s next generation development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations grant money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
The U.S. Department of Defense has previously established this year the Joint Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Center, which is aimed at bringing together partners in the industry and academic world, and the White House has also announced the establishment of a special committee.
DARPA also announced this month about $2 billion investment in the initiative AI Next.
The NSF, in turn, invests more than $100 million a year in research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to establish a National Security Commission has not progressed for a month.
Macedonians in the referendum on the change of the country's name
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change of the country's name to the 'Northern Republic of Macedonia', which would resolve the decades-long celebration with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
According to the province of Macedonia, the name of the northern Greek neighbour is practically a regional requirement for the region belonging to it, and has therefore opposed its access to the EU and NATO membership.
The governments of the countries will conclude a new name proposal in June, but national opponents believe that this change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he is not going to vote in the referendum, and a campaign against the vote raises doubts about whether voting activity reaches the 50 percent limit required to allow the result to be legal.
The issue of the vote was: "Are you part of NATO and EU membership I will approve the agreement with Greece?"
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, supporters of the nomination change, understand that the price is worth paying so that the rise in Yugoslavia from the collapse of Macedonia can strive to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for Macedonian youths, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska Skopjessa, 79-year-old.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said to respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive effect.
The nomination requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Committee, no irregularities were reported by 13 p.m.
However, the voting activity was only 16, compared to 34 percent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, and 66 percent finally voted.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, the capital of Skopi.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum on the Macedonian name change in Strumica in Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small layer and put chairs in front of the buildings of the House of Spears to boikote the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up and not through the door of the kitchen," Kavadarkov said.
“We are poor, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us into Macedonia, we can turn to each other, such as China and Russia as part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev has said that it brings mined investments into Macedonia, with the unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I will vote for a major majority of votes because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said in a statement.
He said "yes" to be "requiring our future."
The opinion review published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday refers to 30-43 per cent voting activity in the referendum, i.e. under the required activity.
In a second question by Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the option.
In order to succeed the vote, the vote must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious restraint for the Western government after its rise in power in May last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero hits his entire Brighton defense in paint
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made clear after Brighton's defence at the Manchester City 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made a painting for 65 minutes to look a funny helmet.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentine top player received no food from the middle field.
He found an empty space on the field by running through the three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed that he was surrounded by four greens.
He kicked over one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English top used its first touch within the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who led Brighton's guard Mathew Ryan's paint in the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his legs."
"We said he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he made a painting at that time.”
Nevertheless, Sterling had already given the interests of the celestial elections.
Painted at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in the deep Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful cross-season to Leroy Sanelle on the left floor.
The word took a few touches before he sent the ball to the back to Sterling.
The celestial attacker hit the ball in the network just before the end line.

Scherzer wants to be a joyful player in the match against Rockies
The Nationals are out of the fight against the fall, so why do I want people to start up?
However, a competitive Scherzer always hopes to take his input in the Sunday match against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has a drop-down game. They have a single victory in the west series in Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies picked up at least a wild card with 5-2 wins from Nationals on Friday evening, but still targeted their first division.
"Although we don't have any bets, we can raise the intake form, knowing that the mood of the public and the other team here in Denver creates the most demanding competition that I have encountered this year.
Why shouldn’t I take the challenge?”
Nationals has not yet published its beginners on Sundays, but according to data, they tend to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw off the exercise period on Thursday, playing his 34 matches at the beginning and eating on Sunday on his normal rest.
Washington's right-wing player has a 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA statistic is 2.53 and has burned the shot 300 times in his laundry, at 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in Western Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation of his Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the Republican voting activity in the interim elections.
“All of our achievements are in the game in November.
We are from five weeks of the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big -- not just a campaign, but a full campaign, and that's why I'm around everywhere to fight for the excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical Democratic group, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to go back to the revolution by any means, and you can see their evil and their wickedness.
They do not choose who will harm or who will need to crash to reach power; they want power and power, but we don’t let them.”
He said that the Democrats took the role of “responsiveness and prevention”.
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hate and evil and evil and deceitful and liar."
In referring to Dianne Feinstein, the most influential senator of the Senate's Committee on Justice, the audience responded with voices.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you have a document?
Oh, uh, what?
Well, no, I'm expecting a little -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion
I'm not really surprised when my local party Momentum activists supported a statement of misconfidence against me.
I'm just the last representative of Labour to say that I'm not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated in the same way only because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the lack of confidence was critical that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The topics relating to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe and ironical topics similar to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I have served as a local representative of the Labour Party Council have been the same as Friday.
Now that many meetings do not follow that voice, and "friendlyer and weaker" policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party is no longer tolerating different opinions and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is suitable for the party or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I thought I had shared the same political views began to wait for me for a full translation and for the positions I would never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I'm saying - the consequence of the confusion on the social media, which requires the cancellation of my choice, the rejection of central policy, and I hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
It's not just my own experience.
I really know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been addressed to me are politically in nature.
I greatly respect the professionality and determination of those of my colleagues who face everyday sexist and racist misleading, and never hurt.
The normalization of such treatment is one of the most disturbing characteristics in politics of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn urged the Labour Party to take into account a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with any unconfidence or a change in the rule of choice, the party becomes more restricted.
For two years, I have been invited to keep a low profile and to stop expressing my thoughts so that "everything will go well."
But that’s not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence against Thatcher’s Government’s Single School, I have been as an ambassador to the city as well as in the office of the Ministry to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never hid my political line, not even in the last elections.
Nobody in the Nottingham East election circle has been surprised by my viewpoint or my contradictions with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the State is moving towards domestic, business and public services disrupting Brexit, I don't understand the need to waste time and energy in question my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I will promote you with honour, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr in Blockchain
Two paintings in the last moment were slightly distorted by the end of the match, but Ayr won a day of winning in the amusing Tennent ́s Premiership.
Ayr is now the only team in the top of the table that hasn't lost any match.
Great defense and a more successful take-up of risks was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie may be pleased for the reason.
“We have been challenged in our matches and we are still invincible, so I can be happy,” he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All honor to Ayr, they took risks better than we."
Ayr led 14 minutes by Grant Anderson's painting and Frazier Climon's successful turnover, but the yellow card of Scottish Captain Roy Hughes, given to Warrior's match, allowed Melrosen to rise, and Jason Baggot made the painting.
Climo grew the lead of Ayr with a penalty paint, and just before the half-time he made a painting and succeeded in the conversion point, growing the lead of Ayr to the numbers 17-5.
But Melrose started the second series well with Patrick Anderson's painting, whose conversion shot Baggot managed to get the difference to five points.
The game was a long delay when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and suffered out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr grew up with Stafford McDowall's painting, which Climo succeeded.
Ayrin's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a paint after a hard printing, which was unable to be converted.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Climon's shooting, and Macpherson made a painting from the side-front emissions from the Ayr mauline.
Climo succeeded in the conversion match in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and cleaned Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth painting.

"Sea belongs to us": Inland State of Bolivia is trying to get back connection to the Pacific Ocean in court
The seamen are partitioning outside the Navy support site in La Paz.
In the flags of public buildings, the flag of the blue sea is soft.
The bases of the Navy for Titicacalt Amazon have been twisted with a stunt: "The sea is rightly ours.
It is our duty to get it back."
In the inland of Bolivia, the memory of the resource war lost in Chile in the 19th century remains strong – as it also needs to be sealed in the Pacific Ocean again.
The hope is at the highest for decades when Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has a strong progress, jointness and confusion, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadi said.
Several Bolivians throughout the country are following the decision of the International Court of Justice from large squares, hoping that in Hague, at the end of a decades-long debate, Bolivia’s position that Chile has an obligation to grant its independent access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic president Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the battle in question next year, will play a lot in the next Monday line.
"Palue is very close to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
Some of the analytics, however, believe that the Court is not likely to decide in accordance with Bolivia's interests, and even if it is concluded, the situation will hardly change.
The Dutch-based United Nations institution has no power to give over to Chile’s administrative territories, and the ICJ has also stated that it will not count on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that ICJ’s decision is made only six months after the last statements indicates that the case is “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed rather than promoted the goal of Bolivia.
"The current Bolivian government has raised a question of maritime relations," Zárate said.
Morales’s controversial rhetoric has finally undergone the goodness of the Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it is very difficult to organize negotiations afterwards.
There has been no other embassy in both countries since 1962.
Former President and Bolivia representative in Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the Court's decision would have been extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to fight 139 years of disputes for the benefit of each other," he said.
Calzada also objects that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, had used the maritime movement as a political support.
"Bolivia should never give up its right to connect to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to go ahead of the past.”
North Korea said nuclear revolt would not happen unless it could rely on the United States
North Korea will not renounce its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington," said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the heads of state at the Singapore summit.
The statement came just before U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo restarted nuclear diplomacy, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "distant dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the US resistance to the Korean war’s ending declaration would lead to the knees of North Korea.
Before Pjongjang first took significant measures to promote arms dismantling, Washington is reserved to adopt a declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pjongjang is about to abandon the armed system, whose state is likely to be the only real way to guarantee its security, has gained extensive doubts in its part.
Pompeo will visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows present the newest model's large-scale headquarters, which are also the point of your neighborhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover the sun entirely, you don’t have to continue searching.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne uncovered a selection of special super-isolated majors in their SS19 displays, which would deny the style circles of Paris.
Very unpleasant chiefs dominated Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent them to their amazing creations as well as to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most stunning creation was a widely equipped beige hat that covered the heads of the models almost completely.
Other magnificent accessories were, among other things, decorated with jewelry of water, weared and even an ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of special gloves – just before Halloween.
Several colorful leathers had sweat lips, and they resembled more Hannibal Lecter than top-mode.
One of the creations with snorkel and mask resembled more suction instruments, and the other resembled a soaked ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand for the great fashion, you have visited a tour.
The followers of fashion predict that enormous bowls are appearing in the streets.
The over-sized hats are the following strictly "La Bombaa", with a half-meter-learned shoulder shark, which has been seen on all of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the culture of an unpleasant hat, which was widely seen, also cleaned up the other cook cream into the fashion shows – the oil-made beach, which is almost as large as the model wearing it.
The polluted orange necklace raffian bag with white leather sleeves was the most impressive creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 model in Paris.
His famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m seeing large hats and sandwiches in the street next summer – designers have made such a great impression that it would be difficult to avoid the demand for large-scale situations.”
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for the world’s people
Scotland's learning results have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued as a result of good trial results in 2018. The success has been strengthened by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30,000 students, represented by the SCIS of Scotland’s private schools, are trying to provide high-level services to their students and students’ parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their chosen career, postgraduate and higher education and global nationality.
As an actor in the educational sector, who can design and implement customized learning content, we have noticed the position of languages as a popular and desirable student in continuous learning institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only use the English language if we want to create relationships with people from other countries.
From the latest test results of this year, we notice that languages are at the top of the lyrics, as regards the percentage of access to detailed schools.
68 percent of students who study foreign languages achieved the highest rating A.
The material was collected from 74 schools belonging to the SCIS. Based on the study, it was found that students who received the best rating A, 72 per cent had studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent had studied German, 69 per cent had studied French and 63 per cent had studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s detailed schools support foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages are currently free-selecting subjects, but are considered the same value as natural subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study program of private schools and elsewhere.
On the basis of a 2014 survey by the UK Employment Agency, 17 percent of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employer was explained in a lack of linguistic capacity.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the promotion of future career development of young people.
The more possible work tasks require linguistic skills, the more essential these skills form in a global world.
If a person has studied another language, he has a priority position in the future of this life age consciousness, regardless of what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner to automatically advance a linguistic person in the competition.
According to a 2013 survey made by YouGov, more than 4,000 adults were unable to speak in a foreign language, and 75 per cent were the only French language with a dual number of 15 per cent.
Therefore, contributing to the teaching of languages is now important for current children.
In particular, the knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools differ in what they teach languages.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposed to be important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarinic and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, a number of language options are always taught by specialist teachers.
Scotland’s detailed schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed what the future ever brings when it comes.
At this time, it cannot be forbidden that international business environment languages will continue to be extremely important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Today’s languages should be seen as “international communication skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is head of the SCIS of Scotland's private schools
LeBron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
The expectation of supporters waiting for LeBron James’ first-time in Los Angeles Lakers is over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said James would play against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays, he can be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48," Walton Lakers said on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a few minutes.
Exercises from the follow-up were asked by James earlier this week about his plans for Lakers before the six matches that were played through.
"At this stage, my uranium no longer needs pre-competitions to prepare me," he said.
Trump’s Western Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five election events planned next week, including memorable items such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his election to fill the Supreme Court with the free place of the judge, Trump seeks to raise support for the future inter-elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing the majority in the November Congress elections.
What time is Trump’s Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event begins at 19 p.m. at the East Coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump’s Western Virginia campaign event online as a live stream via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will take his stand for this week's hearing of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has become unexpected due to allegations of sexual disturbance, which have delayed the Senate's vote during the week of the FBI's investigation into allegations.
But the priority of the campaign series is to support the success of the Republicans in the rigorous November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump’s campaign commented on the five events of the following week to “revel voluntary and profitable Republicans in order to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives,” he said.
“Congressional governance is so essential for him that the president is ready to travel to as many state as possible during an occupied campaign season,” Trump’s unnominated permanent representative told Reuters.
Today's event is located in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there can be supporters from even "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit in the past month to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has remained in opinions.
"There is no good sign for Morrissey that the president is trying to increase his position in opinions," state scientist Simon Haeder at the University of Western Virginia said.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team will demonstrate a fighting freelancer to keep hope up before Sunday’s single games
After three single sessions on Saturday afternoon, the four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the power to reinforce success itself is a completely invented phenomenon in sport, however, players believe in it, and even more in such tournaments.
Where is this success for them at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead position that dropped to four, so we take it as the hip of this success force," Jordan Spieth said, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, a priority station: four points in front and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experienced that they had a little wind on boats and a lot of encouragement, such as the status of Spiethin and Justin Thomas, allowing them to play together all day and get three points from four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the way to the vegetable, and leads to examples.
The winning party's handwriting songs strengthened his round forward when he succeeded in a critical downturn to balance the match equal to four, when he and Thomas were two points behind the two holes.
The potter who won the 15th match followed a similar shout that gave him the idea that he believes that the United States team has not yet lost.
“You have to focus very well and just take care of your own match,” Spieth said.
This is the only thing that these players have left.
18 holes make an impact.
The only players who have gained more points during Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the uncontroversed legends of Ryder Cup Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
The special, but heritage twin in Europe has won four of the four without a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only double who did no bogia on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine hole on Friday morning.
This round, and the way they give and get energy from the public, confirms that they are a predecessor on Sunday. And when the sun climbs at Le Golf National, the second most popular player to ensure Europe's possible victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time with different holes.
The talks about Europe's success are very early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly bloomed with Alex Noren, a pair of Sergio Garcian, who was a four-game hero.
One bogi and two doublebogi in the first nine holes dropped so deeply into the hill that they were not nearby to survive.
Even on Sunday, no one can help you out of the cup.
Four balls and square games are exciting to follow closely from the point of view of the couple’s cooperation: what kind of advice they give or leave without giving and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has taken a significant lead position before the last days, but this quadrant has shown that the U.S. team has a fighting will, especially in the U.S. it is suspected.
Europe takes 10-6 leads before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before Ryder Cup's last day after taking 10-6 lead stations in four balls and four balls from the United States on Saturday.
The great twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari winning two wins from Tiger Woods and won a score of four points at Le Golf National today.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to preserve his loss in Hazeltin two years ago, ruled the U.S. team in the four-and-a-half match.
The U.S. was stronger opponent in four-games to win two matches, but they couldn't defeat the lead position.
Jim Fury's half needed eight points from Sunday 12 to preserve the win.
Fleetwood is the first European initiator to win four points in a successive manner. He and Molinar, also known as "Molliwood", were the second double in Ryder Cup's history, who won four points in the first four games.
After being shot in the four balls of Woods and Patrick Reeds, they then finished up the 5-4th of Woods and the U.S. initiator Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who hardly survived two matches on Saturday, was sometimes great, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four balls, and even seven in a succession.
Justin Rose rested on the four-foot balls, but returned to the four-foot balls with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third.
Europe didn't get everything in the way it wanted to be as a fun and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The three-fold value winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They gained 2-1 victory from Spain's Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter in four balls, and then 4-3 victory from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four balls, however, after the first two holes were destroyed.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has risen from four points to back-time levels at the beginning of the double-games, although on the side of Fury also the balance is enough to retain victory.
However, after two days, the second best can be that the attack on Sunday is too demanding.
North Korea is “not in any name” rising himself without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions only raised uncertainty in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea should abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant charitable measures" in the last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and control tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
“We haven’t seen the same thing in the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure to maintain national security, so under such circumstances, the fact that we are unilaterally dismantling ourselves is not possible."
While Ri reiterated the well-known complaint stream that Washington does not accept step-by-step nuclear resignation in which North Korea would be awarded for any interim point, his opinion is significant in the sense that unilateral arms discharge was not completely excluded, as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. President and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on 12.6.
North Korea has attempted to officially decide the Korean War between 1950 and 53, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the facilitation of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States requires "nuclear destruction first" and has raised pressures by means of sanctions to achieve their goals on a violent package - even opposing the "peace declaration"," Ri said.
“The fact that the sanctions will bring us to our knees is an uninterested desire.
But the problem is that ongoing penalties only deepen our inconfidence.”
Ri did not mention the plans to organize the next Kim-Trump summit, but Trump himself stressed the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If a party demanding discharge would have been South Korea and not the United States, the situation would have not advanced in such a disruption."
However, Rin's vote was significantly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the orientation of the continental areas to the United States was inevitable since the "bad president" Trump called Kim as a "suicide man".
Last year, Trump threatened to “destroy completely” North Korea, but this year, however, Trump urged Kim to reject this courage to approach the resignation of weapons, but he stressed that there is still a lot of work left and the sanctions will remain until North Korea resigns from nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a temporary striker: “If it took two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia stated that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for progress.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council Thursday that "the reinforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong and fail until we testify to the complete, final and strengthened nuclear resignation."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006,in order to stir up the financial channels of production of ballistic and nuclear controls in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met at the UN General Assembly of North Korea and announced his visit again in Pyongyang the next month to prepare the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times over the course of this year, but the last visit hasn’t been smooth.
When he left Pyongyang, he described the progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterous requirements" only a few hours later.
North Korea has pledged to close the rail site and the nuclear plant at meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes "compliant measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "respective measures" security guarantees committed by Trump at the Singapore meeting, and the transition to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students graduate from a sufficient rest guided course
All bachelor's students at Harvard University participate this year in a course designed to increase students' rest. The course is an opposing to the flowering machocult culture at the University where students press a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students of the world’s best university are often quite unknown in basic issues related to their own well-being.
The course designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of the Harvard University Medical School, who works for a united study at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for a course after reading about the impact of sleeping on learning.
"After my lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why do I hear this only now, the last year of my study?'
“No one had ever told her about the need for a dream, which I think was surprising,” he told Telegraph in an interview.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right units support academic and sports performance and improve overall well-being.
Professor at Harvard University Medical School and vice-director of University Health Services Paul Barreira says the university's completion of the course after they had heard how students suffer from serious sleep disorders during a week of study.
An hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will be presented a picture of the apartment in which the student can click on coffee cups, cups, sports equipment and books, and thus get information on the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long-term sleep can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
“We know that this has no immediate impact on students’ behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters in the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects caused by smoking,” Professor Czeisler added.
Throughout the night, students are still a subject of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and today’s technology and students’ ever growing pressures have made an increasing problem of sleep.
"Give enough and high quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleeping causes a state of hunger in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry," the professor notes.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in Chemistry and Physical Psychology in California, assisted Professor Czeisler in designing the course after he participated in one of his courses in his first bed at Harvard last year.
He tells the course that he opened his eyes and gave all the students of the campus to organize a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all graduates will be able to perform a similar degree before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set up a wake-up clock to also remind them of sleeping time in addition to morning awakening and invite them to keep in mind the adverse effects caused by electronic display devices and LED lighting "blue light" on day-to-day rhythms, which can make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: With a win win from Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and Rangers once again experienced a new loss day, when Dolly Menga’s break through a breaking defense brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
Ibrox players were looking for their first victory since February 4–1, which was played against St. Johnstone. Gary Holt’s team won the victory this time, and Gerrard has only experienced another loss during his 18-game manager career. Rangers remained the top eight points of the current Hearts league.
Menga solved the ball's painting seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers falling in the battle pact was no longer balanced afterwards.
Rangers fell in the game as a result of sixth place; instead, Livingston moved to third place, and the top of the painter is only Hibern.
Rangers may have other problems in the face, as Calum Spence was injured as part of the object thrown from a guest view during the game, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for the team to hit Ayr and advanced in the Scottish League semi-finals.
Holt continued at the same time with the Livi 11 compilation, which the team took a score from Hearts last week. The same strategy resulted again when the well-built compilation managed to punish the opponent almost every turn.
While Rangers managed to dominate the ball’s possession, Livingston was better to use situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to get the painting at a time of two minutes when Meng's first entry gave Scott Pittman a free path to Allan McGregor's painting, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then led his freelancer to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, managed only to break away widely into his backdrop.
Rangers took control of the game on the other hand, but in the last third of the game there was no more self-confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a punishment for five minutes when he and Steven Lawless met each other, but Judge Steven Thomson left Colombian requests without regard.
Rangers managed to try only two paints in the first half, but former Ibrox painter Liam Kelly struggled with the paint of Lassana Coulibaly's pocket and Ovie Ejaria.
Livingston's painting at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation did not only lead to a team's hard work.
Rangers still couldn't do anything for Jacob's long entry tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave Scott Robinson, who coldly put the ball to Meng for easy paint.
Alternatively, Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The option was almost instantly influenced by Kent when he created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack stopped Kelly's rapid defence.
Livingston ordered visitors to play their own game again, as Lithgow and Halkett continued their long entry after each other.
The Holt team had an opportunity to increase the leadership of the game in the last few moments, but McGregor's great defense prevented Jacobs from reaching Lithgow's positions in the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came to Ranger's exchange, also asked for a punishment when he took Jacobs together, but Thomson again looked off.
Almanakka: Geigermittar inventor
Next page "Sunday Morning" is born on September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geigermeter.
The method has become one of the foundations of science, and also the main concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Watches" is well suited, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans show extremely influential scholars of the cattle:
Man: "What's that miracle?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter. It's used to search radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your ears on your ears, you can really hear the radioactive impact in minerals."
Evans: "Look, now it's really riding!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
The invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ disadvantage cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ disadvantage cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify defected cells as part of treatment
In the process, resistance cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, injected cells are able to “see” the typical proteins for several cancers
The vaccine has given promising results in different cancer patients.
For example, the ovarian cancer cancer cells disappeared over 18 months after treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify defected cells.
In the method, resistance cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory, so that they can ‘speak’ the typical HER2-proteins for several cancers. The transformed cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S., describes the method: "On our results, it is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "manages the growth of several types of cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer as well as eating ovaries, lungs and thickness."
A similar approach – taking resistance cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also resulted in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was in the critics’ teeth when he praised Trump at Saturday Night Live.
The show did not go according to plans.
Kanye West received a slight boom in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after being praised by President Donald Trump in a sharp style and announced his ambition to be president in the 2020 elections.
After his third song "Ghost Town" in Trump's "Make America Great Again" campaign, West attacked Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“When I talk to a white man, they ask me how I can support Trump because he is racist.
If racism was a problem, I would have changed America for a long time,” he said.
This evening's broadcast began with a schema where Matt Damon dismissed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing at the Senate's Legal Committee. The hearing is related to Christine Blasey Ford's arguments about Kavanaugh's sexual anxiety.
West's pause was not presented on a direct broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock downloaded it on social media.
It's unclear whether Rock's purpose is to put West on his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he was like being treated in the culinary because of the shadow he held on his head.
"I was tried behind the churches.
I was told that I shouldn't go to the board with this hat.
I'm tempted!
Then they still say I am in marginality,” West said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues to say, "Do you want to see what a marginal feeling means?" and says he's dressed in the Steelmen's reference, because "sometimes you can't prescribe my actions. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Varietyn, West's comments surrendered the public's burdens at least twice, and the actors of the show seemed disappointed. One of the presents described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was chosen for a short-term warning program to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, raptor Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by introducing the song "I love it" as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from the president of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who praised this courage on Twitter: “THANK YOU TO THE ROSHKES”.
However, Karen Hunter, who attracted the discussion program, said that West "is just her own, which is once a great thing in general."
However, I can decide to be a supporter of a person (by buying this music or clothing mark or by supporting this "art"), which I consider to be a supporting and spreading ideology for my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us,” he added.
Rapper announced before his evening appearance on Twitter that he changed his name as a "person known before as Kanye West".
West isn't the first artist to be named, but the musician follows this Diddya, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as the Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the previous music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later to an artist, known before as Prince.
Belfast's restaurant shopper is accused of murder
A 45-year-old man is accused of murder after he was beaten on Friday in a restaurant in Belfast.
Police said the incident occurred in the area of Ballyhackmore.
The accused is expected before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewed by the Prosecutor General Office.
Kit Harington is attacking the toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swording hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series.
However, Harrington has injured the stereotype of a machosanker: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that “something has gone astray,” and questions the means in use of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo period.
Recently, as well as the Royal Seat Star Card, including the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, Harrington admits that she has a strong desire to engage in the subject.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with male clinicality is now awakening strong feelings in me," he says.
"What have men been taught over the years of their growth, which has led to the problems that are now detectable?"
Harrington believes that television and highly masculine characters in it are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He said, "What is the inner birth and what is learning?
What do we learn on TV and streets that make young boys feel that they have to be certain types to be men?
I think this is one of the biggest questions in our time – how can we change this?
“Young men have something really bad.”
In an interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the Royal Seat's predecessors or post-parts after the series ended next summer, because he said he "has been in need of fighting and horses."
In November, Harrington will be seen in the new version of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells about the filmmaker and the killer's brother.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his future Rose carriage was the best that the Royal chairman has offered him.
“I killed my wife in this show, so in a way it gave me my family and my life from that time,” she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte by Harrington's Jon Snow's love goal in the Emmy Award series.
The pair was held in June 2018 on the accounts of the Lesli's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections has increased by 14% in China
China has reported an increase of 14 percent in HIV-positive and AIDS-related citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820,000 lives in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Clearly, most of the new cases have been translated through sex, which means change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has rapidly spread through some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan County Conference, HIV pollution in this way has been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of HIV infections and AIDS in China has increased with 100,000 cases.
HIV contamination through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married to women, due to the conservative values of the country.
Many disease infections are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to ensure the general availability of HIV drugs as part of action to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters disregards the information of the employee's defeated Republican director and accuses of spreading "dangerous lies" and "alliance theories"
Maxine Waters, a representative of the U.S. Chamber, contested arguments on Saturday that his employees would have published personal information on three Republican actors about them on Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles assured that "extra-right" commentators and websites are distributors of the arguments.
"Trust, lies, and more deceitful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published information, the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representative of South Carolina, and of Senators Mike Leen and Orrin Hatch, representative of Utah.
An unknown person published information about the U.S. Congress on Thursday during the Senate Committee hearing, with regard to the accusations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
It took place a little after three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pund and RedState report that, according to the Hill's newspaper, the messages were published from the IP address associated with Waters Office and the staff of Waters.
"This injustice is completely wrong and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
“My employee whose identity, personal data and security have been threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations shall not be responsible for the discharge of these data.
This unreasonable accusation is totally wrong and absolutely lies.”
Waters’ opinion quickly gained criticism on the Internet, and critics were also involved in the White House’s former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he disbelieves this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for the Congress member.
When a person is accused of something he hasn’t done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason for threatening.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
In this case, we must behave moderately and quietly.”
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the critical judge Kavanaugh, accused of excessive hostility during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican leader Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters in the elections, has also expressed his view on Twitter.
"It's incredible if it's true," he tweeted.
Waters notified in his opinion that he had contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies due to these false accusations.
"We care that the factors are disclosed," he continued, "and that they are legally responsible for all devastating and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English hits again – Rowan Atkinson's agent parody
It has already been established that the tradition of looking for brexit references to any part of Britain from the film that is expensive, but this does not seem suitable for the Johnny English agent parodi and the series of action comedy, which began in 2003 at the Johnny English border and revived in the 2011 postgraduate section "Johnny English – Newborn".
Can the language of the nation's satiir in the pocket become a new national export minister to the UK?
In any case, the lonely, rude and unfair Johnny English has already earned his promises to repeat, and his name tells, above all, that it is a comic creation that is directed to the non-English film market in the English world.
Of course, it's about a distorted secret agent who desperately seeks to inspire a smooth glamour around him, but appears to be a mixture of inspectors Clouseaua, Mr. Beani, and his unfortunate single singer at London's 2012 opening concert.
As the base of Hahmo, the cosmopolitan and mystical world man, which Atkinson originally presented in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads.
It's time for the last show.
I particularly liked the scene when Johnny English arrives on a helicopter in a medieval armchair dressed, and the rooter's ladders climbed on his wings.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts are present, but the humor itself seems under-effective and unnecessary, particularly because ‘grave’ film brands, such as 007 and Dangerous task, now offer humor as part of the key content of the film.
Humor seems to be directed to children, and Johnny English's secular treatment doesn't seem to me as inventive and apparent as the comic of Mr. Bean's microrolls.
Every year, the recurring point is that the UK is at least worse in trouble.
The cyber hacker has moved into the UK’s top spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents in the field as a warning of an agent in service – which is shown as a small role-playing performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last piece for the main and overwhelming prime minister, who is already ready to listen to the political inconvenience in the mouth: Emma Thompson is doing everything in the skins of Teresa May's parodies, but the script doesn't just offer him enough space.
When Information Service Advisors report to him that all the scams on the field have been disclosed, someone who has already moved from the active service must be promptly invited.
Of course, it's tough Johnny English in his own personality. He spends his retirement days as a teacher of a fine school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the foot of a spying in his knowledge. The subject is confusing some nucleic jokes; English holds School of Rock lessons in the halls of inquiry.
English will be thanked for an emergency meeting held in Whitehall, where he meets again his infinite fighting license Boughin, which is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn’t feel his rights.
Thus, the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to their Majesty’s Secret Service to address the fateful supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletov, acting by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, actor Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough turns into a farse of the same way: a double-sealed man who is serving as a fan will blow a fine French restaurant in the fire and cause chaos while trying to hide Voltan’s luxury jail. The company to get to the house of Voltan with virtual glasses ends in a pure anarchy in the real world.
The last obstacles of the actors are punished in the end of the fire, but despite all the independence and fascination, the film still feels a little done for children's society.
The movie can be considered moderate.
When I watched Johnny English movies, I’ve got the same thought: why can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify her gift?
The British Labour Party Discuss Plans of Four-Day Work Week With Five Days
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, considers a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but pay the salary from five days.
The party shall be informed of the transfer of savings generated by the revolution to the workers in the form of an extra holiday.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends at the same time.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic programme and its plans to contribute to the policy for the benefit of workers.
The Central Association of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of a high-level working party tells Sunday Times: "The review of the line was informed before the year's exchange.
The change will not happen at a time, but the four-day working week is a goal that matches the party's approach to balance the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's general industrial strategy."
The Working Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party has committed to support the transition to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective cannot be shared in the Labour lines.
The representative of the Working Party said: "The four-day working week is not the line of the party, and the party is not considering such a transition."
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell took advantage of the last week's work conference to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was decisive in inheriting the power to regain from "unfruitful dictators" and "artists" of general interest companies.
According to the shadow administration plans, the current shareholders of water companies would not be able to return their shares as Labour’s government could carry out “reductions” on the basis of detected misuse.
It also strengthened the plans to place employees in corporate management and to create inclusive ownership funds, allowing 10 % of the share capital of private enterprises to be transferred to the management of employees, according to the plan to pay up to 500 pounds per year to individual employees in shareholders.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy will discuss the 60-minute program on whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh's investigation into allegations has delayed at least a week of final vote on the appointment of the Supreme Court as judge of Kavanaugh. The delay also raises the question of whether the result of the investigation could exacerbate the support of some Republican actors for the appointment of Kavanaugh.
In the 60-minute program section, Scott Pelley, writer of the Republican Party Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether it could be possible for the FBI to find out things on the basis of which they could change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“So of course,” Kennedy said.
"When I heard it, I said I had a conversation with the judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the charges came up, and I asked him, ‘Do you do that?’
He was deliberate, decisive, unclear.”
Rather, the voice of Graham appears to be rocky.
"I have made my decision on Brett Kavanaug and it's a bomber," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the next thing: Brett strongly objected to it," Graham added Christine Blasey to Ford.
“No one in his name was able to confirm the matter.
It's about 36 years old.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York on Saturday, a music event with a play map as impressive as its mission: the elimination of poverty from the world.
The seven-time Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to listen to actors like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make the event a real goal: eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation for Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people actively acting to eliminate poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP stick), the audience must perform separate tasks or "works" such as voluntary work, send an email to the political executive or call a call, or perform any other work that spreads awareness of the project’s objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded now that the goal is still 12 years?
Is the idea of a free concert bottle a real way to allow people to take action, or is it just one of the ‘cliquity’ among others – an imagination that the world can change by signing a web address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen has announced its accounting of more than 19 million "works" made for different targets since 2011.
According to it, these actions have encouraged political leaders to report commitments and principles equivalent to over $37 billion, which have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than $10 billion have already been used or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group consisting of investors and executives in the UK, which is committed to "exploring the development of children in their full potential". The group committed to delivering $700 to the Rwanda $35 million to the end of the sub-nutrition of the country when they were sending to the country. This took place after the Cizen.
"With the British government, donors, governments of different countries and just the world's citizens like you, we can transfer social injustice and under-nutrition to the journal of history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert held in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British government was also invited to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with more than 5,000 workforces. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million mothers and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the traffic site is: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen’s answer: “The road will be long and difficult and there are many composite stones in front of us.
However, we will succeed, like large civil rights struggles and the movements against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are the motion for the New York concert this year, and its star chart includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, the country could make energy exports more difficult by using the Navy as a "stress"
According to Washington Examiner, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinken, Washington can "assuredly" use its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world markets nearby.
Zinke claims that Russia’s actions in Syria – the invitation of the legal government – are a cause for the recognition of the new energy markets in the area.
"I believe that [Russia] is the cause of the presence in the Middle East of energy, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinken said.
According to the holder, there are ways and ways to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep ships open through its fleet and, if necessary, to ensure that the energy they provide does not come to the world market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the public of the event organized by the Energy Consumer Association, a non-profit group profiling as the "Energy Consumer Sound Tower" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that it is one and the same thing.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less craftsmanship, and the replacement of fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as a "circle number of one temper" based on fossil fuels.
The statements are about a situation in which Trump’s administration has strived to increase the exports of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace it with a significantly cheaper Russian liquid gas.
To enhance this, Trump’s administration, including President Trump, is trying to agree to Germany to withdraw from the “inconventional” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that President Trump says is bound by the Berlin Moskva ruler.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of 110 billion square meters of the current pipeline, as a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims to be purely economic reasons behind Washington’s opposition, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe we will share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has caused a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial ceiling organisation, the German Industrial Union, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very problematic with the fact that the third country is involved in our energy management," German Central Industry Association chief Dieter Kempf said recently after the meeting of German Allied Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, intends to consider the condition of being set in presidential elections in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that he would "require carefully" his position as president-in-law after the arbitration.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidate in an open questionnaire in Holyok, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and fix our wrong administration, and this also means women at the headquarters of the kingdom,” he said.
“After the sixth day of November, I’m going to think about being carefully appointed president.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump during the occasion saying "he's driving the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” he said.
Warren has appeared directly in criticizing Trump and this Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In his tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “I think we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, according to an opinion review published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s voters do not support this condition for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Policy Research Institute and a study made by Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the establishment of the Senate.
32% voted to be a candidate.
Several of the respondents supported the condition of former Governor Deval Patrick with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
In other debates, the nominated Democratic candidates for 2020 elections are, for example, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has officially stated that his candidate would be candidate by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son’s military traumas in Donald Trump’s election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year after he was invaded in Iraq in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and he was accused of family violence.
"From what my son has to go through after returning home, I can very well compare to other families who have to face the consequences of the PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers are carrying back home," he told the audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Donald Trump's election.
Palin called the arrest to be a ‘restraint in the living room’ and said his son, like other military veterans, “when they return home a bit changed, they come back hard, they come back to wonder if we respect what he and his companions have done for the benefit of this country in their military and air force.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to police officer Dan Bennett, he was accused of family violence and violence against women, as well as family violence and arms treatment.
18 states and the Columbua Association support the stand against new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the Columbus Alliance are applying for a change to the new line in force in the United States that does not grant asylum to refugees of jeans or family violence.
Representatives of the 18 state and the federal district have left the law letter friends on Friday in Washington. The letter supports asylum seekers who have broken the line, according to NBC News.
The entire name of the applicant has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal line.
He tells his partner "and his sons belonging to his violent band" that he's been insulted by the U.S. authorities to ask him for an asylum 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s supporting general prosecutor described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of which are from the U.S. asylum seekers, as countries where jeans and family violence are a widespread problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked the decision of the Commission for Asylum Applications in 2014 that paperless immigrants were able to apply for asylum based on domestic violence.
Attorney General of the Columbian Federal District, Karl Racine, commented in his statement on Friday that the new line "regards attention over the decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the letter of the law says.
Attorneys also argue in their letter that the practice of preventing access to asylum seekers will harm the U.S. economy, because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and “see the necessary extra labour force”.
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration matters to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gender violence.
"The refuge is intended for people who flee their homeland to race, religion, nationality, or a certain class of society because of persecution or fear caused by political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on the new asylum practice 11.6.
Asylum has never been intended to solve all problems – even serious problems – faced by people every day around the world.
Desperate rescue actions continue in Pal – the number of deaths found has already doubled
The situation for the survivors becomes even more serious.
"Your condition is very sturdy," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was silent about her hot baby, in a evacuation center located in the ruined city of Palu.
"The ambulance brings new bodies for a minute.
Clean water is few."
The residents return to their devastated homes, take away their deported goods and try to save what is left to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals injured in 7.5 magnitude harassment are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from broken back and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated due to continuous, severe follow-ups.
His eyes were filled with tears in his story, how angry the earthquake devastated the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We couldn't save ourselves.
I was pushed between the walls, I thought." Harris says, according to Associated Press, and says he was a wedding party in the city of his family.
“I heard my wife shouting, and then she became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "province" with "propaganda announcements"
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. law as a propaganda tool. This occurs a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertising that praises both sides of the trade agreement between the U.S. and China.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the annexe paid to China Daily on Wednesday in the Des Moines Register, which is widespread the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, accused of interfering with China on 6.11.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s businesses interfering in U.S. elections, according to U.S. authorities speaking to Reuters, mean a new step in Washington’s expanding campaign for China’s pressure.
Although it is normal that a foreign government is spreading announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently constantly engaged in an escalating trade war, where both parties in turn impose customs duties on counterpart export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, Chinese kostotariffs were targeted at the beginning of the trade war to states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-term governor of the Iowa state says Beijing has damaged the U.S. workers, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a great exporter of agricultural products to China.
"China is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," Branstad wrote in a statement published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"The Chinese government is taking advantage of the traditional U.S. free speech and press by placing a paid declaration in the journal Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In Beijing's street newspaper centres, only different opinions are visible in a limited manner, and real, different opinions that Chinese citizens may not see about the alarming development of their economy at all; this is because the media is strictly in the youth of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad continues to say that "one of the biggest newspapers in China insisted on publishing the offer" the article he wrote, but it does not specify what the newspaper is about.
Kavanaugh Fiscus Release Women's Voters from Republicans, Analysts Warn
The fact that many Republican tops are behind and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaug, can, according to analysts, cause an anti-reaction, especially in the future elections of women.
The emotions surrounding the case have been in large circles, and most Republicans have already announced they want to move forward in the vote.
"These things can't be cancelled," says State Guide Professor Grant Reeher Syracus's Maxwell Institute at The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher doesn’t believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona) has offered the last minute offer of angry voters to agree on the FBI examination.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday and they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national reform group MoveO’s spokesman on Friday.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators were singing “that is coming in November” by showing their opinion on the Senate’s decision by the Republicans to appoint Kavanaugh, which took place despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s certificate, Mic reports.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluated,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unengaged political analyst in an interview with the news site.
“People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially in neighboring uncertain women’s voters and younger voters, a pair of 18-29-year-olds who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Analysts predicted a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans proceeded with a confirmation before Ford's testimony speech against the Supreme Court candidate, where this made their claim for sexual concern.
"This is going to be a confusion with the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, said at the NBC News street at the beginning of last week.
"This is not only about the Committee's vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is being put to hearing, it is about how Republicans have acted in the matter and how they have treated Fordia," said Guy Cecil, head of the U.S. Priority Democratic Group.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided into whether they would believe Ford or Kavanaug’s Witnesses’ advice in the tendency of the majority of the niche to the second side.
According to a new opinion made by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s witness statement absolutely or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh absolutely or likely.
In addition, 38% say they think that Kavanaugh is likely or absolutely lying in a witness statement, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Flake's imprisonment, FBI investigates Ford and at least one of the other accusations made by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford proved to be injured by Kavanaug at the age of 17 when he was injured by Ford.
Ramirez claims that as a member of the Supreme Court, she revealed her family membership at the school school when they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, has launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Open Source Solid Foundation.
Solid allows users to decide where their information is stored and who has access to any information.
In the interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed at Inruptin’s purpose of “government of the world”.
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup company.
"There is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data storage" or POD.
It may include contact lists, memory lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique personal data storage is that it is fully connected to the user who has access to any type of data.
The company calls it "personally validated through data".
John Bruce, CEO of the company, said Inruptin’s idea is to provide resources, processes and the necessary skills to import Solid to all.
The company currently includes the security sector purchased by Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM, some employed developers working with the project, as well as the community consisting of voluntary encoders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupta website, all of which is available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing "with Facebook and Google about whether people should be offered a complete change in which all of their business models are turning to their head in one night."
“We don’t ask for their consent.”
In an article published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the task of providing commercial energy and ecosystem to the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the Internet by the World Wide Web Consortium at the University of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in a debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as the founder of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute, as well as director after the launch of Inruptin.
"I'm an extremely optimistic network next time," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero of the First World War
The city celebrates the only award-winning Victoria Cross metal of the Church of England, a military priest after 100 years of events.
It was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Pastor Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 due to the incidents of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt villages.
However, he died four days later, unless he had ever learned of the highest honour of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were disclosing monuments in a paradise held last Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is a "influenced symbolic"; the memory was revealed just 100 years after his awarded grandfather's urotheum.
According to London Gasset, Lieutenant Vann, 29 91918, led his patalions over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense sum and under the fire of heavy fields and machine guns."
Later, he broke out his front line, and "the greatest shower" led to the advancement of the troops before he saw himself in the fields alone. In the following battle, Vann dropped three of the soldiers of the cupcakes in his own hands.
Lieutenant Vann died of a German precise shooter created on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather was “something compared to which I could never achieve something that would raise respect.”
Michael Vann He left his brother with Dr. James Vann on the sepulchre after the parade of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band Orchestra.
Michael Vann says it is "a great honour to participate in the paradise" and added: "The great crowd of people is to remember the honor of the true hero."
Friends of the free game waited for the Bellator 206 tournament all night – the TV channel looked like Pipsa Possua
Imagine the situation where you have monitored all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event will not be presented.
The San Jose event program had 13 matches, of which six main series matches, and the show was intended to be broadcast directly on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the program, the program turned Pipsa Possu into a big tournament for the spectators.
Some of the viewers weren’t really pleased with watching the whole night because of the match.
A friend of a freelancer opened a substitute for the match described on Twitter, drawing children as "a kind of sick joke".
According to the law, the content was not appropriate to be presented at six hours in the morning, so they had to change it to the children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellatori's senior deputy director for marketing and communications.
"Pipsa Possu, yes."
Bellator’s CEO Scott Coker said schedules will be working to allow British viewers to track the events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a re-enviation that will probably allow us to operate the program," Coker said.
“There is, however, six in the morning, and we should not be presented before Sundays in our time, which is, in turn, Mondays in their time.
We're working on this.
You can believe that when the program changed their minds, the messages began to go in the direction and the other, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and we tried too much.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feel Underestimated for Sexuality
Swimming player and Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells him that he feels less valued for all other sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete noted that when he arrived at high school, "everybody is not the same as me."
Lauren Lavernen, spoken on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, tells Daley about the rights of homosexuals to give others ‘hope’.
He also tells us that after having a child, victory at the Olympics was no longer so important.
Christy Young, a long-term permanent radio shower, has taken several months for free because of the disease.
As a guest in Laverne’s first program, Daley said she felt younger than everyone else because “there wasn’t socially acceptable to love boys and jobs.”
He says, “To this day, these feelings feel less and differently have been reality, and they have given me the power and energy I needed to succeed.”
He says he wants to show that he is ‘something’ so that he won’t produce disappointment to everyone after his sexuality finally reveals itself.

The three-time world champion tells him to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “as a surprise.”
Daley married herself with a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but she says the age has never been a problem.
“If he experiences so many things so young,” Daley says, “it’s hard to find another person who has experienced similar events with his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple received a boy in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of Daley’s “the whole perspective” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have turned around to win a golden band,” he says.
"You know, there are more things than the golden Olympics.
Robbie is my golden Olympics."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at only 40 years of brain cancer.
Daley said that her father never accepted his death, and one of the last things she asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets, he wanted to sit in the eturivian.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t be there anymore to be in the eagerness,” Daley says.
"I loved her hand when her breath stopped. Just when the breath had really stopped and she was dead, I finally realized that she wasn't invisible," she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the prons.
“I knew that this was something I’ve hurt my whole life – jumping in front of the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an enthusiasm in his first song selection – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – that raised feelings already when he was preparing for the Olympics, and that still gets his skin on chicken meat.

Semiconductor for Mickelson exchange banks on Saturday at Ryder Cup
U.S. Phil Mickelson violates recording on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to be petrated significantly to avoid remaining a recording round in history as a misfortune.
Mickelson, who plays every two years in the recording event, transferred to the exchange banks for fourball and foursome periods played by Captain Jim Fury on Saturday.
Usually, the five-fold American Major tournament winner has now spent half of the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the field trying to get their beating over.
A 48-year-old Mickelson, not even considered to be one of the most precise drivers in his career, is not an ideal choice for a strict Le Golf National field, where a long-growing crash punishes for unprecedented strikes.
If Mickelson is not in the field enough, on Sunday, the nineth match is against the famous British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays together with Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to set the tube of all four wins this week.
If Americans, who are four points behind 12 double games, get a flight, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could he say in a situation.
"He fully understands the role he played today. He shot me back, routinely, and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a little self-confidence.
He is the most controversial player and has brought so many of his teams in the past, and this week.
I couldn't imagine he would play two matches.
I imagined something else, but that's how this went and we got this solution.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson violates Nick Faldon's recording of several Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup, which never had been comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halfs, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, noisy, he's a funny guy with people's expenses and he's a funny guy with whom everyone likes," he explains.
"The younger players have also had fun with him this week. It's fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the lead position can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, my captain of the European team, knows about the experience that by taking Ryder Cup’s lead position before the last day’s double-games, it can become a work trip.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderra, where Seve Ballesteros led five points to Americans, but who survived in the calc lines right and right with his nose and won with the narrowest possible margin141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It reminds ourselves of how we steadily led in Valderra, we steadily led in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderra, even though thinly,” Bjorn said after looking at the team’s 5–3 wins in 2018, both Friday and yesterday, I moved to Le Golf National.
The story will show both to me and to all the other members of the team that this has not yet been over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot in a small caliber.
We go to the field and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win this award, and we only aim to it.
As I’ve always said, I’m focusing on these 12 players who play on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the opposite side: the world’s best players.”
Bjorn, excited of how his teams have defeated the hard field, added: “I will never be knocking before I get rid of such things.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow there will be a priority for individual achievements, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player’s capacity will be tested later.
This is a message that must be transmitted to players – tomorrow for the best possible performance of everyone.
Now it is necessary to give up a partner who can also go [to the field] alone and do whatever he can.”
Unlike Bjorn, opposition captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals as they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, however, has experienced the full translations of the last day in both directions. He was involved in the team winning Brookline before he ended up losing, when the European team won "Medinah's Miracle".
"I remember every word of evil," he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 team, turned his team into dogs of the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like it happened in Brookline, or like it happened in Medinah.
When it gets moving in one direction, it gets a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our composition according to it, and we will put the boys on the field in the way we want, as you know, we will do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead defence fights and he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter are in the next order to meet their European opponents.
"I put the group's guys in this order because I think it's going through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his two-game choices.
Germany’s new warship will be delayed again
The German Navy's latest fregate should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the vessel is to replace an early Cold War equipment, but it will be introduced early next year due to faulty systems and explosively rising costs, local media report.
According to a military report spoken to the newspaper Die Zeit, the introduction of the first Baden-Württemberg fregatic class ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’ has been delayed for the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to join the ship in 2014, but the worried after-supply problems have pursued an ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg Marine Class ordered in 2007 are to be replaced by aging Bremen Fregates.
According to the available information, they are equipped with effective control systems for combating air and surface vessels, as well as with the technology of welding, such as the reflectiveness of the coat and the detection of infrared and acoustic signals with a technology that reduces the detection of the signals.
The main features of the ship also include its longer maintenance – new fregates should be able to operate on the sea for up to two years without moving between the port.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the highest of the technology, which is intended to improve Germany’s influence in the marine regions, are already aged at the stage of entering service, notes Die Zeit magazine.
Last year, the German fleet refused to officially launch the ship and restored it to Blohm & Voss's headquarters to Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship after its delivery.
The reasons for the refund are little known, but the German media has spoken of essential "software and hardware decorations" that make warrior unqualified fighting tasks.
The program extracts are particularly key because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class is about 120, which is only half of the elderly Bremen crews.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s possibilities to subsequent updates.
The Rheinland-Pfalz capacity of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the corresponding class used in the Second World War in Germany.
In addition to criminal equipment, the whole project’s price box is also a problem.
The price is reported to rise in the amount of €3.1 billion, when the original price was €2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new fregats have emerged when the German naval authorities have recently been warned to decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament Defence Committee, noted earlier this year that the fleet's eligible vessels "are going less".
According to the officials, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been disabled, but new ones have not been delivered to them.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class fregates could be implemented.
Environmental Organization Secrets Encrypted Life of Packages
A new study conducted in the upper area of Scotland seeks to find out how the rabbits use the land when hunting food.
The new research is expected to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying nipples and guide future protective measures.
The research carried out by scientists by the National Trust for Scotland is monitored by the planting garden in the area of Inverewe Garden, which is located in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices will be placed on the important areas of the area to monitor the functioning of the packs during the season.
The system’s employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable detection devices.
The frequency of votes and the kinds of species are ensured by the analysis of experts.
Based on the results, a living map and a report will be created in which the behaviour of cowboys can be presented in the image of the region's scale.
Rob Dewar, an organization’s natural resource provider, hopes to reveal the results, which areas of the environment are the most important for the rest of the world, and how different species use them.
The information is helpful in the design of habitat areas, such as the creation and management of forestry areas, taking into account traps and related species.
Scotland’s and the entire UK’s vacation population has declined significantly over the last 100 years.
Building and land construction works threaten the resting places and living environments of the houses.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, as well as cutting papers and chemicals used in certain construction materials, as well as attacks on pets.
The contracts are not blind in fact.
However, due to night hunting, their ears are more beneficial in hunting than in the eyes.
Leaves use advanced localization technology to detect insects and barriers on their flight pathway.
National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental organization that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares regions across the country – and they are seriously treated with confusion.
It has ten specialists who regularly perform surveys, checks on places of rest and, in some cases, animal rescue activities.
The organization has even founded Scotland’s first and only country of Threaven maps in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, which are dedicated to the protection of legacy, with eight of the ten legacy species in Scotland.
According to accounting nurse David Thompson, the area is ideal for rests.
“Threave is very well suited for the resters,” he says.
“We have old buildings and woods and, in general, a good living environment.
We don’t know everything about the holidays, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to better understand what the holidays need to succeed.”
He emphasizes the importance of reviewing the buildings for the rest of the rest of the country before refurbishment, as the elimination of one rest of the rest of the country can undoubtedly cause up to 400 deaths of the rest of the rest of the country and destroy the entire local population.
Animals are protected and the killing, disturbance or destruction of their places of rest is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Packaging Protection Organization, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, “We still have a lot to learn from our agreements, and we still don’t know how their populations can manage.”
Ronaldo contests prosecutions while lawyers prepare for a trial against a German periodical
Cristiano Ronaldo has denounced rape accusations against him as "refusing" and says people want to "advert themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have made the claims to publish the German periodical Der Spiegel in court.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raped Kathryn Mayorga by an American woman in a lazy gas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to pay the victim $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared in a direct Instagram embassy to 142 million followers only hours after submitting claims. The 33-year-old footballer fought the accusations hard and described them as "refusing".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news,” the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or told the camera.
“They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, it belongs to this profession.
“I’m a happy man and everything’s fine,” the player smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to challenge Der Spiegel’s allegations to the court, which they have called for, according to the Reuters news agency, “unfair reporting of doubts falling within the privacy area.”
Attorney Christian Schertz says that the player is reimbursement “for mental suffering according to the severity of the breach, which is probably the most serious breach of personal rights in the past years.”
The alleged case was reported in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldon and Mayorgan are told that they met in a nightclub and moved to a player's room where he is alleged to have raped this analytically, according to papers delivered by the Nevada Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo has laid down the knee after the claimed event and said that he is a "99 percent good guy" but that "one percent" produced disappointment.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple of sex, but it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she visited the police station and took pictures of her wounds in the hospital, but later ended with the reconciliation because she was "ashamed of the possibility of paying" and worried "to be subject to public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking to revoke the settlement procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the deal to move to Real Madrid during the alleged Manchester United crash, and moved to the Italian Army team to Juventus with a $100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain "because of eternity" after car production ended
Britain would "beat forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that the Toyota UK unit’s announcement was “carefully” to temporarily cease production at its factory near Derby, Burnston, if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says the impact of border delays is visible to lose jobs if Brexit is reached without a deal.
The factory in Burnstown, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, manufactured nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported elsewhere to the European Union.
"My point is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU by the end of March, we will stop production," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Toyota Burnaston Unit.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of withdrawal from the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced its production of Mini for a month when the Brexit takes place.
The main concern, according to the automotive manufacturers’ report, concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the implementation of non-contractual Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is rotated in time by the JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from the UK and the EU, and cars are made from order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can cause border disturbances, which may lead to delays and deficiencies in the sector.
According to Toyota, keeping a more than one-day warehouse at the Derbyshire factory is impossible, and production would be interrupted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "accurately calibrated to avoid these inspections at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best possible deal, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we have to make use of," he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota’s, but also other manufacturers’ statements show that we must definitely be able to continue the series of very well-functioned supply chains so far.”
Toyota is unable to tell how long production should be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce its competitiveness and ultimately cause jobs losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnstown for 24 years and is a factory manager of the professional association, says: “The lost jobs, according to my experience, will never come back.
The Government’s representative said: “We must present a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Assistant Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be “pleased to be transferred to another week” due to the obligation indebted by Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervised by the Special Attorney Robert Mueller’s work, who, in turn, investigates Russia’s interference in elections, relations between Trump’s assistants with Russia and the potential action carried out by the President to prevent justice.
Trump has been excited in Washington for months to separate the Assistant Minister of Justice, which would endanger Mueller's investigation into impartiality.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein’s discussion on the possibility of enchanting secret discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of separating the President on the basis of Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has objected to the information of the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was told Rosenstein’s withdrawal from his office.
However, President Trump was at that time visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "not prefer" separate Rosensteen, but the meeting was delayed as his time had met with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's plenary vote.
Trump's press chief Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "It could be next week, this week, it can be delayed yet another week because of what's going on in the highest court right now.
But I always want to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists may disagree with this assertion: Sanders did not like the White House press office since September 10th.
Reporter Chris Wallace asked for this.
Sanders says that the cause of the lack of press orders is due to other reasons than the contradiction to TV journalists, but he said: “I am rejecting the fact that they are attention-seeking.”
However, Sanders made it clear that the future of direct contacts between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president has more inquiries than any president before him," he says, and further evidence without citing: "We have checked those numbers."
“The press orders will be organized,” Sanders said, but “it is very much better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We often try to act in this way, and you have seen that we have acted in this way over the past few weeks, and this will be replaced by a press release so that you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open events or press conditions with people who are visiting.
Presentation in a press conference alone is rare.
This week, in New York City, the president possibly showed a reason for this in the event of unprecedented and occasionally strange reporters gathered on the site.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) originating in the EU regarding the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to employees of the Scottish healthcare system originating in the EU to express their gratitude and wishes for their stay in the country after Brexit.
Scottish parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter to the United Kingdom to leave the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish government has already been reserved to cover the costs that will be affected by the applications of EU citizens working on specialized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: In the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also strengthened the preparations for the potential uncontractual assets.
I know that for all of you these are uncertain times.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our employees to citizenship.
Co-workers from and out of the EU are bringing valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie for an Emergency Disorder
Christion Abercrombie, supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, has been in an emergency after the team had lost 31–27 Vanderbilt Commodors on Saturday, reports Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the frontline and just shortened it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side side before placing him in pairs and bringing him to the side for a more accurate assessment.
Tennessee State spokesman Chris Harris told reporter of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been on surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that “there is no information about the type of injury/frequency at this stage,” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays the first through the team after its transfer from Illinois.
He had five taklauses on Saturday before he left the game, making a total of 18 taklauses this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher taxes when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher taxes when buying real estate in the UK. Additional money will be used to help the Conservative Party in accordance with new plans.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters
Increasing tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless
Theresa May will today be informed of the highest tax rate for portable foreign buyers when buying real estate in the UK. Additional money is spent to help homeless.
The action will be seen as a company to neutralize Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper apartments and has paid attention to the taxation of good incomes.
Increasing tax is aimed at people and businesses who do not pay taxes to the UK. The extra money from this will be aimed at government action to facilitate unwoven disturbance.
The additional fee – which is added to the current lease tax in addition to the two-year-old housing and investment losses – can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year.
13% of London’s renovations are purchased by residents not residents in the UK, which increases prices and harnesses the possibilities of first-class buyers on the real estate market.
Many wealthy regions in the UK, particularly its capital, have become ‘water cities’ because several foreign real estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will only come weeks after Boris Johnson introduced a reduction in taxes to facilitate the purchase of young people’s primary apartments.
He accused large building companies of holding high real estate prices by purchasing and leaving the land without building it, and invited Prime Minister May to reject quotas of affordable apartments in order to correct the "shameful situation of residence" in Britain.
Corbyn has published a remarkable series of proposals to reform the housing market, including the restriction of rentals and the cessation of "proficiency weddings".
He would also like to give the powers more power in matters relating to the construction of new apartments.
The Prime Minister May said: “I said last year that I intend to own my Prime Minister’s British dream – that every generation’s life should be better than their predecessors.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it may not be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy apartments as easily as hardly as British residents.
Too many people have become too far from home ownership, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to lead the Scottish country team"
Sunderland’s CEO Jack Ross says his “first goal” is to become a Scottish team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland is excited to challenge a team that keeps the country’s corner back home, and currently holds the third position in the UK’s double division.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he had guided St. Mirren back to the Scottish election League last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play my country in the team.
I got into the two team and it was there," Ross told the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often looked at Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and it’s something that has always dragged me back.
Such an opportunity will only be opposed as a successful track manager.”
Ross' former managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic said he hadn't been worried about the arrival of his nominated predecessors with his nomination, he had previously fought the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"Now I can measure my own success with being able to restore this track to the election position.
Based on the structure and capability of monitoring, it is undoubtedly part of the electoral situation,” he says.
"It's not easy to access, but I'd probably only think I'd be successful if I get my trusted team back to the election team."
Ross has been manager for only three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coach group.
After that, he helped Alloa rise from the third-serie falling games and raised from St. Mirren’s falling as champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever in his teams in Clyden, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"I've probably been in a real pioneership with my career," he remembers the time he moved to the lead of Alloa.
“I really thought I would be better manager than a player.
It sounds weird, because I played well, I had a moderate well, and I was able to enjoy some relatively large successes.
However, playing can be hard.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, such as stress and pressure caused by work, but the leadership of a team feels the right task.
I always wanted to lead a team, and now I do it for my job. I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.”
The entire interview will be heard in the Sportsound broadcast on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for enjoying is on Saturday at 17:30, the study shows
The heat wave in the summer has given a breakdown on pubs fighting the British difficulties, but at the same time has pushed more pressure on restaurants chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but the revenue of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business advisor for CGA, said: "Continuing sunny weather and England's predicted longer participation in the football world championships meant that in July the sale of pubs like June was 2.8 percent higher, while the restaurant's ears were ears for a month.
In June, a decrease of 1.8% in the sale of restaurants was only worse in July.
Beverage-focused pubs and bars were best successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than a drop in the sales of restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also suffer from heroes, but less dramatically than restaurants rotators.
It looks like people just wanted to get out of their minds.
The sales of pubs and bars rounded by companies increased by 6.6 per cent over a month, with a 3 per cent decline in food sales.
Paul Newman, an RSM company that provides leisure time and hotel restaurant consultancy services, says: “The results have continued trends since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the domestic external aterization market.
It is not surprising that the fight against food chains continues, although the annual decline in sales by 4.8 per cent increases, particularly now, when the sector is currently fighting with cost pressure.
A long hot summer could not have been worse for food-focused actors, and just the time to show whether the August temperatures are bringing to the painfully needed decline in the industry.
The total growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the establishment of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometry for sales in the UK's pub, bar and restaurant sector, which collects and analyzes prints from a group of 47 competent sectors with a total turnover of more than £9 billion.
Fifty children secrete social media accounts from their parents
Five percent of children – some of them up to 11 years of age – hide social media accounts from parents and teachers, research reports.
A study of 20,000 high school students reveals the existence of an increasing phenomenon of ‘Instagram Feic Accounts’
The news raises concerns that accounts can share sexually transmitted content
20 percent of students say they like ‘capital accounts’ that will be shown to parents
Fifty of the children, some of which are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The study of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapidly growing ‘Instagram Feaky Accounts’ existence, referring to an Instagram website for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that accounts can publish content on sexual harassment.
20 percent of students said they thought they were cleaning ‘capital’ accounts to be shown to parents while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager who hoped that she would be raped after meeting her 13-year-old daughter on a secret site.
In a study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK Organization and the Directorate Committee (HMC), 40 percent of 11-18-year-old youth had two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to their own secret accounts.
HMC’s CEO Mike Buchanan says: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel attracted to the creation of web sites from which parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle's "voice of athletes" to the Scottish government
Eidh Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish Board of Athletes and participates in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is a Scottish award-winning general athlete. Government president Ian Beattie describes the nomination as a great opportunity for athletes to benefit from the extensive international experience collected over the past decade.
"Elidhi is greatly respected for athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and I am sure that Scotland's athletes will greatly benefit from their appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I'm excited to expect my role as a sound tower for athletes and I hope I can be useful and help to guide Scotland's sport in the right direction."
Four Olympic gold medals won by an American athlete, who won 200 metres and 400 metres of trips at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who now acts as a steady commentator of the BBC, lost his ability to walk as a result of a flowing brain circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: "I got a stroke a month ago."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time to show, the door and what kind of condition.
This has been a tremendous job, but I've completely recovered, learned how to walk again and now I've already trained kettery!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Moms cow-breaking ad share opinions online
The breast pumping ad from the breast pumping company has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who produces consumer technology, has introduced a product called "the world's first sound-free and breast-covered pump". Its marketing is accelerated by a language-based advertising that is compatible with the style of music videos that describes the new pump brings freedom to breast-covering mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a necklace that fills their wings with the following songs: "Yes, I lype myself, but she doesn't see" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not utteres, but they're tits."
He continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my baby's out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out of my baby's out."
However, an advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company caused a conversation online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments collected videos have awakened contradictory reactions in viewers. Many say that it makes it ruined the daily ‘throughs’ of the dairy industry.
"Using leaves in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen shortly after their birth,” a commentary writes.

Another reader commented: “It is obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why can’t they be used to advertise breast pump for mothers who can hold their baby?”
The third commentary added: "Perfect real-time advertising."
I also received an advertisement by defenders: a woman admitted the advertisement that she thought it was "cute".
“I think this is a great idea.
I'd get that if I'd still breastfeed.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I took it as it is.
“This is a brilliant product,” one of the comments read.
Another viewer commented: "This is a funny ad that is directed to mothers who pump (often at work or in water) and 'feel themselves like cows'.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the advertisement, women reveal that they have danced insignificant pumps in their chest tubs.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
Instead, the Elvie pump is completely soundless, there are no wires and rods, and it is not noticeably suited to breastfeeding, giving women freedom to move, keep a baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balarin, shareholder and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office, commented: “The Elvie pump is a molding product that has earned a brave and provocative income on the market.
By breastfeeding breastfeeding, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of a pump to the light, bringing the feeling of incredible freedom brought to the new pump in a fun and comparable way.”
The Elvie pump has already entered the titles before.
In London, the mother of two children appeared on catwalk designer Marta Jakubowski’s headquarters using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to tent camp at the Texas border in silence
The number of established immigrants has increased steadily despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, due to the fact that, as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policy imposed by Trump’s administration, the placement of children in local families has become difficult.
Most local families are traditionally composed of paperless migrants, and registration as a local family can endanger their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities reported that possible local families and other adults in the economy had to provide their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the High Level Immigration and Customs Authority, proved that the agency had arrested tens of people last week who had applied for local families for minor immigrants.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal record.
“At least 80 percent of people who are either members of the local family or their households are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue searching for these people,” Albence says.
When attempting to deal with children’s cases, the authorities have introduced new rules that in some cases the case must be addressed in the courtroom within a month of detention instead of a 60-day time limit, the reception centre’s employees report.
Many prefer to appear through a video conference rather than personally conducting their case in the court on migrant matters.
Those who are not considered eligible for aid will be removed quickly.
According to reports published in the last few months by the reception centres and the system, the time spent in children's imprisonment affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent extortion or refugee attempts.
According to experts, concerns are particularly emphasized in larger institutions, such as Tornillosa, where signs of child’s despair can remain unnoticed due to the large amount of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children suffer from trauma already at the moment.
Syria urges the "developers" of the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, spoken at the UN General Assembly, also invited Syrian refugees to return home although the country has been warning for eight years.
Moualem, who also acts as a prime minister, said illegally using the fight against terrorism in the country of foreign troops, and that "the fight will be done in accordance with it."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without condition," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem argued that "the war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and after that, and where millions of people have been forced to escape from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue a “successful struggle until Syria’s whole has been cleansed” from both terrorist organizations and “unlawful foreign troops”.
The U.S. has approximately 2,000 troops located in Syria, where they are mainly trained and guided by the Kurdish and President Bashar al-Assad’s opposition Arab Army.
France has invested battles to rebuild more than 1,000 troops in the country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the circumstances were good to return and accused "some of the Westers" of "the spread of irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
“We have invited the international community and assistance organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They politicize something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted rebuild aid before the end of the war has been agreed by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a puzzle area at the last standpoint of rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to conduct political debates.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a widespread attack on the territory of the Syrian forces supported by Russia with three million people.
However, Moualem has emphasized that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would affect jihads, including al-Qaeda-related fighters of al-Nusra breasts, "which will be destroyed".
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that it will soon be able to invite the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to establish a post-war constitutional draft Syrian constitution and to balance the road for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "the revision of the current constitutional paragraphs" and warned the interference in the matter.
Why Trump will be elected for the second season
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to wish, the officialization and the scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This would certainly be the "Dramatic Presidency decision ever!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have doubled by CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled by MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox News says Nielsen has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best time of view compared to 1.7 million back to four years, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has accessed cable TV: 3.5 million viewers as the leading news channels.
“This is a trick that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, head of the ABC Designated Survivor program, from Minister Neal Baer, who is rising to the president of the devastated assault building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he wanted to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has a value of entertainment.
Unlike other TV programs, the news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade is going, whether immigrants and family members can reach each other and how the world economy can.
Immediacy is a luxury to which only the most privileged viewers are reserved.
And yet it goes beyond the duties of a citizen to look at the sixth hour expert panel, claiming the use of Bob Woodward's source data book for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 struce leather pilot (according to the Washington Post) "Decision of the obscurity of the tank's garments" and the following of Trump's president Stormy

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, at him on the Far North Coast was a wonderful sunny day, but he couldn't go out because he looked at MSNBC while tracking CNN.
He could not leave the program where Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate's Committee on Prosecutions and the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.

Money flows from outside to a strict inter-election contest
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania election circle has faced a real cash flow, as due to the reorganization of the Congress election circles, two already elected candidates have to fight for one place.
This re-restricted Pittsburgh election round is a battle challenge for Democrats Conor Lamb, who became the right of the second election round in special elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th Pennsylvania Electoral Circle, which is overwhelming with the 17th New Election Circle.
The regions were resumed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the Old Electoral Circle would be popular against the Constitution of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th electoral round has launched the financial divisions of the financial parties at the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name was known after the March 18th congressional round of Pennsylvania, which was widely followed in Pennsylvania.
He had been in the Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won 20 percent in the region.
Political commentators have made a great journey to Democrats.
U.S. plans to punish El Salvador for China's support, but resigns
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and a mild reaction in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group’s leadership team.
U.S. Foreign Ministry officials decided to invite U.S. diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "discriminatory lines that have no longer been recognized by Taiwan," said Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were considered only to El Salvador, who was estimated to receive $140 million from the United States in 2017, including drug control, and development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been severely affected by a state of Central America with a high level of unemployment and anxiety.
In the progress of internal meetings, North and Central America’s authorities delayed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity, and the corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent immigrants from seeking to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administration officials made it clear that the meeting was desired to move forward, and this effectively decided to speculate El Salvador's possible punishment.
Vice-President Mike Pencen is now expected to give to a meeting scheduled for mid-October some kind of sign of what the weight value governance gives to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American missionaries returned in all silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new missing messages or punishments from Washington.
The Bolton White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report confirmed an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke to the protection of the anonymity condition.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by the special lawyer Robert Mueller on the prevention of President Trump's potential right, which now has very pressing evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reported to investigate whether Trump’s campaign is secretly in cooperation with Russia when Russia interfered in the US elections.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will notice that he is accountable just when preparing for him to go back to his voters, and that he is likely to be condemned by his comparisons.
There are lots of discussions here, and I don't mean to say that President Trump's loss would be inevitable - more than the loss of the corresponding individuals in Europe.
We have to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions will determine how long this fight will be formed.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been willing to defeat Hitler's power if the West had also resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid followed by years of bleeding.
The passage of history is going to such a turning point where the inevitable progress of democracy is either accelerating or delaying.
The Americans are now faced with a number of such translations.
What shall we do if President Trump separates the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been delayed since the public became aware that he had proposed a secret presidential speech to be recorded and considered the possible inability of the presidential to manage his task.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is wrong.
"How do we react if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's operations is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual distress and dishonest testimony?
And above all, do we vote for an inter-election congress that considers President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these houses, our democracy will have a long and dark winter.

Ranger's Graham Dorrans as optimistic to meet Rapid Vienna
Rangers meets at home Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after the same month’s match against Villarreal in Spain, the victory of Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach the European League G.
The middle-field player Graham Dorransia stopped reaching the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a gameboard for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good response,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
Maybe we would have been able to catch the end of victory, but overall, the balance is probably a fair result.
They were probably better on the first half, and we got fast on the second, and we were better.
On Thursday, there will be an important evening in the European League.
Hopefully we get three points, but it will become a hard game because their results were good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this team we can give everything and achieve a positive outcome.
Last year it was really hard about my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy; the exercises are smooth.
Hopefully, we can now take full pressure, leave the mind behind the season and succeed.”
Fear of retirement leads to women's nights
Although the participants in the study had a clear view of how they wanted to take care of themselves, only a few had spoken about it to their relatives.
About half of the participants in a global study said they were discussing the costs of long-term treatment with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they were talking to their children.
“People want to take care of a family member, but they don’t take the subject,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Let's start this way.
Talk to your husband and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell your wishes in time.
Talk to your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important factor that determines the cost.
Take into account the economic methods for the discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
The financial options for long-term treatment may include, for example, traditional long-term health insurance, hybrid insurance for covering these costs, or private insurance if you have a reserve.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative on site so you can designate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the development of the rule for your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take care of financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills will be paid if you can’t take care of them yourself.
Also remember small details: imagine that your age parents would be in a healthy emergency due to travelling to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about her medicine and allergies?
Write this information into the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.

Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in severe earthquakes and tsunamis attacking the city of Palu on Friday in Indonesia.
Since the communications to the area are gone, rescue authorities have not received any information from the northern part of the area of the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the surface center of 7.5 magnitude ignition.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about Palusta and Dongguan on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawes, located close to the valley on the western coast of the island of Sulawes, with a population estimate of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit the city’s 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the reliable coastline of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, with an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main businesses in the economy of the province of Central Sulava, and in particular the coastal region of Donggal, are fisheries and agriculture.
It is also important to take nickel, but it has focused on the opposite coast of Morowali Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palū and Donggalan have hit several tsunamis over the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongguan.
Tsunami also hit nine people in the west of Donggal in 1996.
Indonesia is seismically active in the Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in North Sumatra on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami that attacked 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the area of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Niasan on the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 magnitude earthquake attacked the southern part of the Indonesian most populated island, Jaavan, which caused a tsunami that hit the island’s southern coast by killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude strike hit one of the islands of Sumatran Mentawa, causing a ten meters high tsunami, which destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Surface crash attacked the area of Acehin Pidie Jayan, causing human destruction and panic in remembrance of the tremendous earthquakes and tsunami caused by 2004.
This time no tsunami was born, but more than one hundred people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Pali’s eldest son was arrested in charge of domestic violence
The oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice-President's chairman, Track Palin, has been arrested as accused of convictions.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaska police, Palin, 29, was arrested for suspected domestic violence and prevention of domestic violence and opposition in the event of arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took her female companions on the phone when she tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
At the time of testing, the Mat-Su Pretrial trial is set for $500, according to the TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin came to court on Saturday and said he was "naturally innocent."
Palinia is accused of three infringements of class A, which means that he can get up to one year’s imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of the violation of class B, which can be sentenced to day jail and a fine of $2,000.
The fire is not the first time accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of his father’s injury to Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the attack.
The case is currently being addressed in Alaska's veteran law.
In January 2016, Palinia was accused of domestic violence associated with gun possession under the effect of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of beating his face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palinia in 2016 because she combined her son’s violent behaviour with a traumatic stress disorder caused by the Iraqi service.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed after the earthquake hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-magnetic earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication connections are over and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake attacked just outside the central part of Sulawes on the north side of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, it turns the videos from the moment of shock.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals in the city of Palu when tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider falling a rare death sentence to NYC's suspected terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York are targeting the death penalty of Sayfullo Saipoville, New York City, for suspected terrorist attacks that have killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been implemented since 1953 in the state of the federal crime.
According to the accused, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot’s rental car in a hit in October on the West Side Highway bike road in the south of Manhattan, where he was driving on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application of a death penalty in the southern district of New York, death penalty is possible if prosecutors are able to demonstrate that Saipov killed "intensively" eight of the victims and caused "intensively" serious physical injuries.
According to the legal document, both of these charges are possible for a death sentence.
Weeks after the strike, the federal court laid down in Saipoville an accusation of 22 pertaining to eight murders in order to assist a terrorist organization. The federal prosecutors typically use this name in cases of organized crime. In addition, the accusations included the accusation of violence, violence and motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "a remarkable design and preparation", the prosecutors noted and described the way Saipov carried out his actions as "wrong, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to Diego Enrique Angelinin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruchin, Hernan Diego Mendozan and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccon families," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed from the previous time that the right to the Southern District of New York has been sentenced to death.
Attorney Khalid Barnes was found guilty of two drug dealers' murders, but he was finally sentenced to an eligibility prison sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last implemented in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the spouse Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted of a murder in the Soviet Union for a trial during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of repentance in the days and months followed.
He told the researchers that he was doing seemingly good, the police told him.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had received an inspiration after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted to visit his ISIS flag hospital.
He responded to the 22-year-old accusation that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the representative federal defence attorneys of Saipovia, said the defence was "naturally disappointed" in the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand death penalty and no recognition and ealing without the possibility of liberation is a solution that only extends the trauma caused by these events," Patton said.
The defence of Saipov had previously asked him not to have a death penalty.
The conservative parliamentary scientist said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to protest against "mobilize the civilian army."
The former Ukip chairman said politicians must feel the pressure of eurosceptics - when one of the parliamentary representatives of Theresa May proposed him to lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Representative Peter Bone said to Birmingham martyrs that the UK would "be out" if Farage would be a Brexit secretary.
But May faces the differences between his deeply divided lines by agreeing to the challenge that the conservatives undergoing remains, associated with a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise on the surface of the Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU's pressure.
The supporters urge him to continue their businesses to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backwards - and to force Eurosceptics and the working party to make a choice between his proposal and the chaos.
Bone said Leave Means Leaven in the event of his Solihullis wanted to "snack the Chequers proposal to go".
He suggested that Farage should be involved and this should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been led, we would have been out,” he said.
Wellingborough's parliamentary writer added: "I'm breaking Brexit, but the Chequers proposal must be freed."
He expressed his EU response: “We have not warned the world wars to end our end as underground.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.”
Bone was confused by the idea that the public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: “The fact that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay is a completely wrong argument.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the Mars and told reporters: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Its people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by members of the party or activists who really go to the streets and are mostly responsible for our success.
Create the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The Ministers can keep their work when they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians must feel pressure if they intend to rotate the decision made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
It is now about trust between the people and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to water Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t accept it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to rotate Brexit to have to feel the pressure behind you."
“We are going to mobilize the army of the citizens of this country, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is again an independent, self-governmental and proud state.”
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before a two-hour opportunity in the city center.
A small group of activists pulled out the "Tories Against Brexit" colds. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party denounced the conservatives of the security issues they had at the beginning of the meeting with the party's app.
“That’s the people who say they’re getting IT systems in a state-of-the-art and all-technology for Canada plus plus arrangements and unlimited operations for free trade in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a full farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren seriously considers the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was seriously considering the presidency after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports on Saturday that a mass-chassis Democrat spokeswoman’s future at a city hall in Massachusetts.
Warren, known for his recurring criticism of President Trump, encounters in November in the latest Republican Geoff Diehlin, who was co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is expected to stand up against Trump in the 2020 elections.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyok was his 36th city meeting with voters after Trump’s early season.
One of the participants asked if Warren wanted to be president.
Warren replied that it is now time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and it includes a woman in the highest place.
Detention in the LSU Sims shooting case
The Louisiana Baton Rougen police reported on Saturday that he was arrested a person suspected of the shooting resulting in the death of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rougen police announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. at the ET Information Centre.
The police had released a video from the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help to identify the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got his head worse and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was in the interviews, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not arrest and was taken to East Baton Rougen police station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player in Baton Rouge, who played 32 games and 10 initiated last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 plateballs per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after offering him a victory from Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas led Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercede's team arrangements played an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good ride and left Hamilton almost his own luck in defending his place in the first two rounds, calling Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the valley first and left Hamilton to drive a group with him, which had to solve the situation.
Mercedes walked on the tour later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton moved after taking a slight contact and the Ferrari driver moved from the inside line, resigning from his investment after two-thirds of his turnover movement.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st birthday, began to be streamlined and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was led by a large part of the competition as he extended the change of tyres by starring for a quick ending and for the fourth position from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally arrived at the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds when Riikköse took the fourth position.
This was a difficult day, because Valtteri was perfectly running for the whole weekend and was a real master to let me go.
The team has made an exceptional career by achieving a double victory,” Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump rejected Senator Dianne Feinstein’s statement that he didn’t publicize Christine Blasey’s letter, in which this accused Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court’s candidate of sexual anxiety.
Speaking in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Committee on the Prosecution, but said that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of people's "clearness, distress and dishonesty".
“It’s one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been taking place in the Senate for the last few days, seeing a disturbance, people who are angry, evil, miserable and unfaithful,” the president said.
“When we see publications and things that are overwhelmed and then they say, ‘You can, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you going to give this information?
Do you remember his reply...do you have a document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't sleep."
Wait now.
"Well, we didn't go out," he added.
Feinstein received a letter in July, describing Ford's accusations and the letter was released to public in September, but Feinstein objected to the clearance of his office.
"I haven't hid Professor Ford's accusations, and I haven't denied his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I thought it confidential according to his hopes."
But his ban was not fit to the president who commented on the matter on Friday at the occasion: "I can tell you that it was very bad tongue of the body.
Maybe he didn’t, but that was the worst of my body tongue ever seen.”
The President continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, which three women have accused of sexual distress and considered the accusations of using Democrats for their own benefit.
“They have decided to return to power in any way.
You see that miserableness and weakness, and they don't mind who they hurt or who they have to walk over to reach power and rule," Mediaite said in a statement.

The airliner died in ensuring that hundreds of passengers on the plane could escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, an airline manager has become a hero after his death, ensuring that hundreds of passengers transported the plane safely arrived in the air.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared by a severe earthquake and tsunami caused by it on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Strong follow-ups test the area and several people have remained injured by the mixture of broken material in the city of Please.
Although the co-workers fled their lives by trade, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old, did not leave his work at a wild airline tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri at the airport in Palusa.
He stayed there and ensured that the Batik Air 6321 flight was on the trail at the moment safely flying.
After that, he jumped out of the flight tower that he thought he was going to be crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian journalist Johannes Sirait said Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, reported in the Australian ABC News news message.
From Kalimantan Balikpapan, a helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter moved back.
“This news is going to hurt our heart,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid of thousands of victims growing because the country's disaster authorities have announced that connections to the cities of Dongguan, Sig and Boutong are in need.
"The number is believed to continue to rise because many bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not met," said Sutopo Purwo, spokesman of the agency.

Micronesian air turmoil: According to Air Niugin, one person is missing after a lagun
In Micronesia, the airline's representatives of a lagoon airline in the Pacific have now reported that one person was missing, although, according to a previous notification, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from a safely devastating aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, after Saturday afternoon, it has not been able to locate one male passenger.
The airline announced its efforts to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane was blown in the water while trying to land at Chuuk airport.
The officials reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and the state of all was stable.
The cause of the storm and the exact passage of the events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both announced that the airplane had landed on the lagoon prior to the gratitude route.
Some witnesses thought that the machine was driven over the wheelchair.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to climb on a riding plane in deep water for emergencies.
He told the passenger staff that he was paniced and shouted, and that he himself got a slight headache.
The U.S. Navy reported the rescue of nearby maritime officers involved in repairs by transporting people on the beach by rubber before the plane climbed into the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in Papua New Guinea’s airlines in the last two decades, but Air Niugini hasn’t been associated with the breach.
Analyst presents a timetable for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor was awarded a recurring trial on Saturday, in which a man was charged with the burning of a Mississippi woman living in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, has proved his time as an expert in information analysis.
He described the team how he used the data recorded on his mobile phone when collecting the movements of a 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers in the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett told her getting the location of several cell phones, which showed Tellis was contrary to earlier allegations with Chambers in the evening of his death, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' mobile phone was at Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed to be a friend with Michael Sanford, the police interrogated Sanford.
Sanford proved on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had spoken the truth when he was in the Sanford car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers felt for about two weeks after his death.
Based on the information on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He washed him out of his life," said Hale.
The final speeches of defense are designed to be initiated on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to proceed to the court team later on the same day.

Again a dark one?!
New York Children's Nurse Calls for a Pair's Justice For Racist Text Message
A new york child nurse challenges the discriminatory separation of the pair’s justice after the child’s mother’s misleading text message, in which this complains that he is “one dark step”.
The couple objects to being racists and confronts the challenge of "disambiguation."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed harassment when a new child nurse, Giselle Maurice, came to work on her first working day in 2016, and I told her that this was dark.
"EIIIIIIII, TAAS TUMMAIHOINE", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
He then sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Mauricelle twice.
When he realized his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, according to the New York Post, had divorced Maurice, stating that their previous departure passports received their Afro-American children’s career had been doing his job badly and this time he had expected the Philippines.
Maurice received a payment for one day of work and was sent home by a taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the pair's right to get compensation for the separation and wants $350 per day for six months, for which she was originally washed to live and work in a family, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that this can't be done," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The pair has responded to racist claims saying that the termination of Maurice’s employment relationship was a reasonable solution because they could not trust him when he was injured.
“My wife sent him something that he wasn’t supposed to say.
He's not racist.
“We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told Post in an interview.
“But would you leave your child to notice a person you’ve been unfamiliar to, even if you’ve been injured?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco, along with the challenge of getting stuck, said that his wife had been pregnant two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
“Do you want to hunt another in such a situation?
“It’s not very comfortable,” the investment bank added.
Although the proceedings are still in ongoing, the public opinion has quickly condemned the pair on social media by sharing their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington's costers were afraid that the audience wouldn't compare to the speaking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born for a while after the acceptance of the book, says: “It’s hard to live in the position of a man who read the book for the first time before his publication.
It’s fun now that Paddington’s great popularity is known.”
Noteing that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about adventures, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that his 60th anniversary of the publication of books seemed to be devastating because his father died in the previous year.
Paddington “represented him as a very important family member” and found his father silently proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and wasn't a tireless guy at all," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child’s achievement to him; what you’re proud of, although it’s actually your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation, he always honored Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dead daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been grateful to the plane when she landed at Nizzan’s Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
“They called a little bit and told me that the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said my daughter would die in a few minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you very much, gold.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs that doctors kept her heart running gradually disappeared from her body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now it's all gone.
I could just sit in knowing that everything was over.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself in size.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who suffered from her daughter’s loss, crashed into the plane among other passengers - who didn’t know anything about the experience she’s currently undergoing.
“No one knew,” he said.
"I kept my head down and tears painted all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a huge sympathy with Nadia.
Now he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Dead women send cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two of her neighbors lost women are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can get support.
Davis' son Tyler was depressed at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I wouldn’t want anyone to have to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, a 45-year-old in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook who had an infectious stroke.
"They were known for their smile.
Everyone said that his smile lights the whole house.”
However, he stopped his work before his death because he felt that he was in the dark.
In 2014 Tyler’s eleven-year-old young brother found his brother, who had lost his life.
Davis says she is constantly afraid of trace effects.
Davis created cards to tell people that there are people who can go to talk even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and has lost his partner Mark after 15 years of joining him shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was downstairs or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the country on Christmas Day, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t take a look at them or any of its ways.”
He notes that Mark’s death was a difficult trauma to them, but they have to survive: “It breaks the family.
It's gonna break us away.
But we just have to continue our lives and fight forward.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the horizon when the FBI starts its investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - temporary and widespread limited investigation - we might be able to achieve a bit of unity," Flake said on Saturday and added fear that the committee would "hate" its supporters.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
In response, it's about time.
The elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the success of the Republicans is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man chosen to the highest court of the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has been arrested and called Senators to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
The Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, will be held.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, whereas Vice President Mike Pence could go through the game and confirm his election to the highest court.
The number of North Korean lockers falls during Kimi
According to South Korean legislature, the number of people from North Korea has declined after Kim Jong-un has been in power for seven years.
Park Byeong-seug cited the South Korean Ministry of Integration and said that the incidents took place last year, 1 127 - in 2011, 2,706.
The park said it was crucial to strengthening border checks between North Korea and China, as well as the rise in the prices of passengers.
No comments on Pyongyang have been made publicly.
Most of the North Korean lockers are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossed the border since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most people flee across China because it has the lowest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarised area between the Koreans.
China treats lockers as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and mostly restores them to the people.
In addition, technically, the relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the stop negotiations on the nuclear weaponry.
This followed a historical June meeting where U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed at a general level on an effort to target Korean nuclear non-armament.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho urged the U.S. to settle sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any kind of trust in the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and under such circumstances, we will in no way unilaterally break down our equipment as the first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysthetic" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Minority chief Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysthetic" and said it was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think that if a woman had behaved so, she would be called "hysthetic," Pelosi said on his own reaction to the witnessing statement of Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally banned accusations that he would have sexually disturbed Christine Blasey Fordia when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in power of feelings, and from time to time, he almost cried out and lost his speech by telling his family and his high school year.
He also clearly convicted the Democrats of the Committee without calling themselves "grote and planned person persecution" by the liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony demonstrated that it was unable to act in the highest court because it proved that he was partial to the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself unfair by his own statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered when he was asked if he would raise an official position against Kavanaugh, if this election would be strengthened and if the Democrats would enter the representative room of the majority.
“If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only valid for the highest court, but also for the right in which he is currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the U.S. Federal Petition Court.
He added that as a Democrat he was worried about Kavanaugh's possible regulations regarding the healthcare reform or Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative lawyer.
In the consultations relating to its confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical and party person to be complained to be a member of the right and we’re expected to realize that it’s wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything
It is a legitimate fire talk over months and years in the trembling, and he should not be deemed to be crying.
"We're doing when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual. Or what do you think?"
He continued: “A woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speaker in a situation where she was angry and began to cry: “You can think I’m now sad because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just continued.
And I thought it was kind of dirty.”
The villages get the right as a smooth breakout path, although they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most remarkable memories of my early work at the male office is that once I cried out inexpressible anger and a older woman - a cold-hearted man I was always a little scared - caught me from the nicknake and threw me into the pocket.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and then they’re happy because they’ve got your bad mind.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congress representative from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on this presidential election campaign.
When Hart was arrested in 1987 by a foreign marriage relationship with Monkey Business on a boat and dropped out of the cave, Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he wouldn't want to be president himself.
“It wasn’t a very well thoughtful decision,” he laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven people already, and the least of them were picked up.
Someone called the situation ‘Sweet and Seven Bears.’”
Since the campaign was too long, he was behind the budget collection and he said he wouldn't leave the box if he didn't get $2 million in size.
It was a lost battle.
I thought that some of his supporters, who gave a thousand dollars to men, gave him only 250.
“Do they think I’ll get something discount?” he asked.
When he kept his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he had the power of his feelings - his gratitude to his supporters, his disturbance to the system that made it so difficult to collect funds to voters and not to delegates, and his anger to sexism - that he couldn't speak.
"I could have thought I'd get a nervous relief," Schroeder remembers the reactions of the press.
“I could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember my thoughts that my graveyard was probably a memorial book.
"He was crying."
How the U.S. and China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The resignation of the U.S. and China trade war was an earliest, and although the battle is nothing but the way, the intermediary of the countries can benefit from Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by designating imports for China’s main export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new customs duties affecting import goods for $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products produced from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded at the same scale each time, lately imposing from five to ten percent tariffs for US import goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. with an eye-style, and does not seem to be the second-largest economic power in the world in a moment.
In order to get Washington back, it should be rejected on its own demands, but the public worship of the U.S. would be quite humiliating to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its card correctly, the U.S. trade war may have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the dependence between countries.
"A short political decision either in Washington or Beijing can create circumstances that start a financial crisis in some country and this is actually a more dangerous chance than the side graduates have ever understood," says Abigail Grace, Asian research assistant Center for New American Security, in the New American Security Idea.
Syrian Foreign Minister says the country is "prepared" to return refugees
Syria says she is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the land after the devastating war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Your situation is now stable and safer thanks to the developments that have taken place in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to correct the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
The events now allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of the unilateral economic activities targeted by terrorism and their daily lives and their implementation.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian government would be grateful for the aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he emphasized that the government does not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that support rebels.
European team confirmed Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup in 2018 at 16.5 points against 10.5 Le Golf National camp outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in consecutively in Europe, and has not won Ryder Cupia in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown itself when its Danish Captain Thomas Bjørn team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had difficulty almost all the time in the tournament and he hit his initial position in water on the 16th-way par-3 by giving Francesco Molinar a match.
Italian Molinari has shine in all rounds and became one of four players who have scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth scored 5&4 of the European team as the underlying player against Denmark Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world’s top player, lost his 2 and 1 score for England’s Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight of Ryder Cup's golf veterans, Spain's Sergio Garcia, won the tournament with a total of 25.5 European career scores.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything.
A year has been heavy.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get this victory.
It's about the team, and I'm happy that I can help," said Garcia after the European team won.
She transfers her sophisticated landlord Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in individual competitions played Sunday.
"I feel great pride when I won Tiger Woods. I grew up with her admiration," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup 13-21-3 record.
You'll find strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who have won 14 big wins and the second remains only for Jack Nicklauks.
The U.S. team had difficulties to find fans throughout the weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finauta whose game was at high levels throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said after a failed presentation: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team on this game.
We're going to get it.
Honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to pick up my hat.
We met our winner."
Status of Red tide flowers: concentrations decrease in the regions of Pinellas, Manateen and Sarasota
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, a general decline in the Tampa Bay region is seen.
According to FWC, more dispersive rest areas are reported from the regions of Pinellas, Manateen, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tide flower extends on the coast about 130 miles from Pinellas to the south of Leen.
The ferries can be detected ten miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but are less than last week.
Red tide flowers have also been observed in the county of Pasco.
Pointed concentrations were reported in the past week from the coast of the district of Pinellas, the concentrations vary from the high to the high coasts of Hillsborough, the background concentrations to the high concentrations in the Manate and Sarasota districts, the background concentrations to the low concentrations in the Charlotte district to the low concentrations in the coastal district and the lower concentrations in the Lebanese district.
The respiratory disorders are still reported in the regions of Pinellas, Manateen, Sarasota, Leen and Collier.
During the past week, no reports of Florida's reliability had been made of respiratory symptoms.
