The black box in your car?
While the U.S. road planners are aware of the lack of money to improve the high system, there are many people watching its solutions in a small black box, which fits cleaning on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motor driver and communicates that information to the officials, today has been the oldest system to finance the main streets of the United States. It is chosen to become a Washington State Department of Management.
In general, the work of high planning, such as Ubayu, has suddenly become a problem of deep discussion and lively associations.
Keeping the miles driven by you, and possibly the location driven by you - and then preparing the Tax Bill for this information - the government has met with Liberian environmental groups to support the side of allowing the use of these black boxes.
The tea party is a tea party.
The U.S. Union of Civil Liberties is also very concerned about different kinds of privacy issues.
While Congress does not agree on whether or not the future should be implemented, many states are not waiting.
They are looking for how they can go into such a system in the next decade, in which the driver will pay for each miles decided on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken the black box for test drives, some of which include G.P.S. monitoring.
This is really an essential thing for our country.
"It's not the subject of choosing or not choosing by us," says Hassan, who is the executive director of the Southern California Government of the Union, is planning to start tracking every miles decided by motor drivers in California by 2025.
There is a change in the way we make payments.
It is technology to do so.
The main reason for this is that the country's highest trust fund has been almost devastated, whose financing is due to the payment of taxes made on the gas pump by American citizens.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they did.
The car is now running more than a mile in a gas gas.
There has been no increase in the Federal Tax over the past 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians also save up a money in taxes.
Li Munikh, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, says, "Gas isn't quite flexible."
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the counter-million payment system.
They say, "It will work as the most reasonable option in the long run."
Wonks call it a mail-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good for urban admirers, because it can change, for example, the changes in the way of driving cars, which can help reduce the gases and reduce greenhouse gases.
California's planners are interested in this system while they are developing strategies for achieving the goals laid down in state's global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Housekeeping Transport Committee, Rep. Bill Shuster (A.-P.A.) also considers the most efficient long-term option for the black box.
In the Reagan Foundation, the independent seller is also on the side of the Mile Payment by the driver.
The Vice-President of Police in Reagan, Adrian Moore, said, "It's not the only thing that's going into blind places."
People who are getting things are paying more directly for them.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who have pledged to move forward from Congress in their report in 2011.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million test project last year, including 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural procedures, which were representing individuals who had to go to work daily or to go to town a lot of miles, Sadan's leadership ended that proposal there.
However, many states and cities are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most desired orange, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
The driver will soon pay the state for a bill instead of gasing.
Nevada has already completed the initial tests.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is using trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 organization, which includes 17 State Transport Departments with East Sibourne (Meriland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where this device had been installed on the cars of 50 voluntary drivers just a while ago, the drivers were so overwhelming that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Aloudhin Khan, who directs the strategic and operational efforts in the Nevada Transport Department, says "Big Bredar and the same kind of other things was the main problem of concern."
This is not what people want.
Along with the progress of the test, Nevada’s C.L.U. warned on its website: “This device will be quite easy to convert to full tracking device.”
There is no need to develop huge, non-management technology-structure shapes, which must necessarily spread to keep the record of each person's coming-day.
Nevada is one of the many states that are trying to get the same technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles a day cars are running, but not where it is and what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do so, people can feel easier.
The search for this technology has sent some state agencies to the small California Start-up, called True Miles.
This company was not in the business of assisting state-owned drivers.
It was trying to enter the market by developing auto insurance, where it was to pay drivers on the basis of their maillage.
But what the device is testing was good for the highway planners, because it does not use G.P.S. and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a certain time.
True Mailage's chief official Ryan Morrison said, "If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this way."
There are some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are also very few ways to interfere with this.
In Oregon, the planners are using various options to give the drivers.
They can choose the G.P.S. device with or without G.P.S.
Or you can choose not to take any device again, but you can choose to charge the average mile determined by state residents.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to worried citizens by providing lower and more facilities in the device instead.
In New York City, transport officers are trying to develop such taxing devices, which will also have the ability to pay the parking meter fee, "you will provide insurance for the payment according to the drive." The payment of the money that the driver will make use of the money- collecting the real-time speed of data from other drivers
The city planning document mentions, "Motor drivers will be attracted to participate due to the benefits obtained from it."
Although, some transport planners are surprised that maybe all discussions on payments are largely distracted according to miles.
The metropolitan transportation committee in San Francisco County said that by increasing the Congress gas tax, it could easily tackle the problem of the highest trust fund of Divalia.
Hybrid or other car drivers can also be charged with additional mutual or annual fees, whose vehicles do not use too much gas in order to pay their reasonable parts.
The Commission's law and public affairs director, Randy Renthseller, said, "When Aspirin can work, then what does it need to do with a molecular surgery?"
If we do so, millions of car drivers will be concerned about our privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death has been devastated.
Albatha, his friend, the police have taken the goods of Diwant to be charged with hiding them to him.

The Indian team, enthusiastic for the winning in the previous match, will have to win a series with the goal of winning the seventh against Australia in M Chinnasvami Stadium.
India had won Nagapur's Wonde at any time to stay in the series after the rain was constantly matched, and his ballasts won him a record of 2-2 in the series.
In the series, India has doubled the goal of over 350 runs, and once again it will be the responsibility to cross the team's neighbouring ballots.
India's ballabage is at the moment in the shadow and a larger target is also being proven to be the ballabage in front of him.
Royth Sharma, Shikhar Tshan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Shuni are in the sharp form, but the team will also remain special expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Rana and Ravendra Jadeza.

India's top three ballbacks are in a sharp form, but there may also be damage to the team of excessive dependence on these three.
Rana and Juraž had been badly flooded in the last match.
Youths haven't been opened in two games in the series.
In this way, they can work for a good "Lifeline" in Bangalore Wound.

Pakistan has been committed to fulfilling this promise seriously.
Suicide attacks on the border are part of this strategy.
In such a state, BJP said that it is also popular to oppose such matters as demanding a deadly ending of military powers in the state.
They have a lot of anti-country elements.
He stressed that the army of the leaders, the security forces, should be stopped on statements that fall mentally.
Snow Dan is ready to "conjure" with Germany on American chess
Edward Sno Dean, U.S. Hoffya Muchbir, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to certify the parliament in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Kent Alexander, fail to respond to his activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stroh Bele met Mr. Snow Den Segurova in Russia, where he was shot to talk about witness in Germany.
A letter submitted by Mr. Sno Dean from the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the results of my efforts are certified positive, my government is considering the inconsistency with the action as a change with the party of franchise, and do not provide a rescue of the king's defence of the defence of Gondagar.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Sno Dean said that he believes that supporting the international community can rule the U.S. government to testify against criminal charges against them.
The allegations from the U.S. Department of Justice include thefts from the property of the government.
Hans Peter Frederick, German Interior Minister, told Time online: "Shari Snow is ready to talk to German officials, so we will have to find ways to make it possible."
Relationships between the United States and Germany have been under pressure because the NSA has claimed that Chansler Angela Merkel's telephone.
Thomas Operman, the parliamentary chairman of the parliamentary committee, examines the information of the survey. He said that if Mr. Snow Den Cosunne had the opportunity as a witness, "relationships with the United States should be completely lost and put them in danger."
Mr. Bele, a member of the Green Party of Germany, published a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on Twitter feed.
He said he was on his journey to Russia with two German journalists.
According to former NSA attorney, if they left Russia, Snowden is unable to return to Russia.
If Snow Dan testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require certainty, he said.
Mr. Sno Dean said in his letter, "They had to face a lasting and lasting campaign for him to leave his house."
Nevertheless, he said he was happy and excited by widespread responses "to his work of religious expression."
The U.S. border - with world citizens, high officials have reported the secrets of a large-scale system of public service surveillance.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German officials "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airline Carrie - on Baggage
Carrie is planning to charge $100 for passengers on its plane board at Frontier Airline.
Frontier Airline plans to start a charge for $100 for the bag and it will pay $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday said passengers can hold full boxes.
New Carrie - On-Free is for bags in overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be charged.
Frontier said they would charge $25 if they were paid in the Advance, they would have to wait $100 if they would have to wait for the passenger to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Ket O'Malley said he had to get $100 per cent to take care of the load in the Advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
Airline started charging for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passengers' fees are filling as much as they can, Carrie - on Baggage, which is standing in the overhead cabinet, meaning that this cabinet is often less space.
The free board is a way to reduce passengers.
It's not really about paying new charging money.
It is for the most loyal customers about Frontier that have become more difficult to find the place of Overhead Bin quickly.
It doesn't have to be given to passengers buying tickets on their website.
This means that the line can give the next person $100 for a same bag, while a passenger on a front door can get a bag for free in line.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in processes are being changed before getting the gate knows about the fee to ensure that passengers are getting it.
Frontier's new Carrie - on the fee, will not start until the summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often show dissatisfied about baggage fees and other fees, but air service likes them.
They argue that the baggage is spending money on handling, and the passenger service needs to pay for it.
The price of the bags on Wall Street is seen as a sign that many airline injuries are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of injury.
Although most of them are not paid on the bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. launched Carrie - On-Free for the first time three years ago, and associate discounter Allegiant Air later.
With such a fee, it is another Wizz Air Hungarian airline, which airline adviser J. Sorenesen said, and who is tracking on-fix.
He said Spirit's Carrie - On-Free brings $50 million a year, estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorenesen, a former officer of the Midwest Airlines, had recently been surprised that Carrie had to face the unusual bag fees on the gate full of airplanes in Spirit and passengers on the gate.
"The boarding process I saw in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to wash my teeth and look out on a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he said it was lickety-split up."
Frontier also follows $2 for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier Neckha that those passengers who take soda, or juice, they can hold the entire cabinet, and this free coffee will only give for once.
However, it will remove the water.
U.S. airways tried to load drinking substances in 2008, but seven months later after passengers complaint they resigned and followed after any other main airline was there.
If Frontier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, then Carrie - this step is its fresh effort to operate Frontier's fees per customer on its own website.
Airline Pays to the Online Trail Seller Orbitz such as $10 to $25 for each back-up ticket.
This is why all airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers directly from them instead of going through an online trail agency.
Frontier, however, has progressed in this area.
In September, many frequent flight miles were given half of the distance to customers who bought an online trail agency from these individuals.
On Wednesday, it decreased the awards of Mayes to 25% of the trip miles.
So, a 1000 miles Frontier trip purchased from an online trail agency will earn 250 miles away.
It is also that they allow only passengers to choose their seat in advance when buying directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city in Denver, but its business is getting less and it is losing money.
The revenue decline of 9 per cent and its flight capacity has decreased by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released on Wednesday by the Corporation Parent Republic Airway Holdings Inc.
The Republican Airline is trying to decide on Frontier's finance as part of the sales of the Republican Airline.
N.S.A. accused the hackers of being a website crush instead of "Internal Error"
The secret national security agency said on Friday that our website had been closed for a few hours because of some technical shortages, not because of hackers, as some people claimed online.
"Today, the NSA.gov was not available for several hours, which was caused by internal errors during the pre-defined update."
This problem will be solved tonight.
This claim is not true that this obstacle, dismissed by service was caused by the [D.D.O.S.] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that NSA's website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not accessed.
The spokesman of N.S.A. said from A.B.C. News that "there was absolutely no consensus with the internal, sensitive network of the Agency.
No classified information is at risk.
At least one group of activists have claimed online they are responsible for restricting the website of N.S.A. by D.D.S. attacks.
The D.D.O.S. attack is designed in such a way that the target website is sent into so much traffic until the site is closed because the server is overloaded.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrecovered and the purpose of attacks was not to converge the internal network of the target system.
Previously extremely mysterious N.A., which was ever called "no such agency", was a lot more in the past months in the face of the events of foreign and domestic jastic programs directed by Ghost and spawned by A.S.A.P.P.A.P.A.P. The conversation and the sound of the cut-off were common among people.
Due to this kind of rising controversy about the agency, after the event of the night, such a breakthrough was made that the event was the result of targeted cyber surgery.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the story of the "A and Dhanacharya" in the context of the era and today's circumstances.
It has been shown to be banned from walking on the wrong path in which a teacher is bound in the surroundings of today.
At the start of the play at St. Joseph Inter College, chief advisory lawmaker Lorddiyal Valmiki, vice-president of the Slavni Council, Shipra Resto, Naresh Consal and power Singh, jointly made.
In the play, the conspiracy of the era was shown and the conspiracy of the circumstances of a professor Arvind in the present time.
In the play directed by Anil Sharma, India Jewelry Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinoud Beachen, Hemant Goyal, Border Samer, Vanshid Chatrude, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc.
The light arrangement in the play was designed by the young colorist Jithandra C. Raj and set Hemant Kumar.
The literary, cultural contributions of Apta in its supernatural event have been offered a variety of awards.
The stage was given to the senior reporter Shwannath Shukla and Jithandra C. Raj, President of the U.S. Department of Singh Vivi.
Secretariat Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaukh, Abid Rizvi, etc. contributed to the success of the event.
Decreased in Bombardier's fault as aircraft delivery, decreased in orders
Canada's airplane and train McCarthy Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profit on Wednesday, in its third quarter and under pressure on air order and delivery on contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not submitted an update on issues that any flight test data for its brand new CSeries will be released or flying into commercial service from September to September.
After the first flight of the test plane, about one and a half month ago, it has only been flyed three times, the question is whether the test stage is on track or not.
The results have fallen less than expected and have been sent to over 8% for sliding in share Toronto stock exchange.
Cameroon Dorosen, an analyst shared with the National Bank's finals, has been limited over one or two quarters of the stock's ranking for "mat" on Thursday.
"We were mostly expected to deliver a small plane, and we are clearly disappointed with the performance of Mars in transport," Dorozen said in a customer note.
We will receive a new order for Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight testing program.
However, if no one will announce new orders in the coming months, there is doubt that the market program will be suspicious.
Bombardier is expected that the airline family can now cut it off at the end of the smaller markets in Boeing and Airbus.
The first test was cancelled in March and for the first time flew in September after the late month.

The new research has shown that we work with complete honesty and devotion during the morning.
You don't lie to anyone and you don't think like stealing or deceiving.
But in the evening, our minds are changing and we seem to walk in the opposite direction of the rule.
Researchers in this research at Harvard University and David Acls School of Business at Utah have given many interesting facts.
According to researchers, without stress in the morning, we give aside the moral values, but since evenings were tired or more pressure, honesty declines.
For this, the researchers used two.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
It was to tell people that the point is higher on the left or on the right.
Those who participated were told that if they answered the wrong answer instead of the right, they would be given money.
The examination showed that between 8 and 12 people who were used in the morning did not make any mistakes and answered correctly.
There, while using people between 12 and 6 p.m., they were found to have been misrepresented by keeping their relatives on the thickness.
This led the researchers to prove that our honesty doesn't matter with the luck of money in the morning, but when we were in the evening we stopped giving ethics.
This research has been published in the fresh points of Cyclological Sciences.

Mr. Big's secret attorney on the police investigation of Cokeen's lawyer
42-year-old Bashart Distance was reported to the Blue Scarborough
The author thought that he could find people know about his private narcotic drugs.
He was sentenced to three years in jail by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The Supreme Attorney of the Rescue Party, who told Mr. Big about the chief police investigation, because he was afraid of being informed of the secret of his narrow drug, has been sentenced for three years.
A 42-year-old Detta, after negotiating her cokenic defeat, had provided sensitive confidential information on the investigation of her narcotic drug deficiency activities.
This author, who was named "Bash" and whose crimes were praised as "Top Breef", was captured from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough.
Officials saw the 32-year-old Scarborough holding three bags of coke in Blackburn, Lancashire, at the lawyer's house, while he had gone out for the Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
In the following investigation of the Delta's hair, its battery, and its credit card, it found that Delta was "regulated user" of the narcotic drugs of the category A.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two people from Scarborough and his colleague.
All four suspects were monitored by the police as part of the main investigation of the heroin and Koken Giroh, operating in Lancashire, Cambria, Marsaceid, and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people, who were sent to prison after being captured more than 200,000 pounds of the prize of 1.5 million pounds during several prints by the police.
42-year-old Death had provided information to criminals, because he was afraid that people would not know about her coke's leaf.
The position in Blackbank was found guilty in two cases of preventing the course of the post-trial trial in the Liverpool Crown court until three weeks. Liverpool Crown was accused of being accused in two cases today.
He had agreed to hold coke in the earliest hearing.
The lawyer's bad time began at the time when Scarborough was investigating the police found that he was regularly in contact with Detta since February 2011.
Two suspects pursued the suspect and saw him coming to the house of the Detta and holding a narrow drug with more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in Black Golf.
After holding the drug, he was regularly in contact with Scarborough Distance on the phone, which had gone out for dinner at Blacker Rovers Football Stadium, Ewwood Park.
When the lawyer arrived at the house, he found out that Nishili had been there and nine times had a conversation between them.
The court heard that the "regulated user" of coke was found in the testing to find the narrow drugs of a category on the hair of Delta, Battaya and credit cards.
Death was later arrested, but he refused to use coke and said he was talking to the suspect dealer, because he was his client and said his discussion was the subject of "more authorization."
During her arrest, Detta tried to remove her battery by removing a lot of credit cards, but it was captured, and the sample of her hair was taken.
In an interview with the police, he said he was driving office alongside his workplace as well as his home, and he called his home for his client details cases.
After the main individuals who were arrested told what Jassus knew about them, the court’s hearing said that Detta Nishili had called the chiefs of the supply chain, some of which had previously submitted the case.
Annie White of the protest party said: "You should know the best about not breaking the law by the criminal authority."
Mr. Detta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal officer, much more associated with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the ordinary narcotics dealer, but about the dealer who is providing narcotics to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be made without doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went out of his limit to the lawyer-client relationship.
He blocked the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta wasn't respecting his profession, he was insulting.
He made a lot more closer than a certain client, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed his agreement independently.
Death rejected any wrong work and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I want to inform Mr. Scarborough, I don't wait for 15 hours, but I do it immediately.
But after the hearing, the superintendent of the police, Lee Halstede, said: "When Shri Ditta began receiving nishi from organized criminals, at the same time, he turned himself into a criminal from the criminal officer."
Due to their cokenic loss, they agreed very well and became much weaker to the targets of the leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to receive important information related to the police investigation.
Authors should maintain the highest standards of truth, and people should have confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta has deceived with this faith and has tried to escape in his profession.
The serious and organized crime unit investigated Mr. Ditta, in which he was found guilty of three incidents in order to stop the way of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to court.
The case should be a warning for criminals that no person is far from access to law.
We will send you a search and submit it to the court.
Scarborough was sentenced for 14 years after he was accused of being convicted of supplying heroin, coke and bang.
A total of 153 years of punishment for narcotic crimes was sent to other members including Pantish in Giro.
Ditta on her website asked questions and answers about her, in which she said that her fantasy would be a job to become a lawyer for a death penalty client in the United States, Mohammed Ali's dinner to be hosted and inequality inspired for his work.

Ra Namo says the government launched the latest fight on 17 October, the sofa in La Provinta, traditionally a Ra Namo-Gard, in the attack on its members.

The Court suspended action on the break-up and crude policy of the New York Police Department
A federal appeal court on Thursday requires a judge's order for the break-up and cruise program of the New York Police Department to block the changes and remove the jazz from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal 2 Judge Shira Shindleer has said that the result of a city's appeal will extend the court's judgment.
In the city of Judgeship, the violation of the Constitution was decided in August to prevent and question people out of their program.
The City Police Department also includes the decision to provide a monitoring to help its policy and related training program change, its conclusions and its healing order has appealed.
The Court of Appeal heard the request on Tuesday.
The Appeal Court said that because he had to deal with a judge to avoid the presence of contempt in part of a series of media interviews and the public should have agreed to make the case for the U.S. judges to be judged in order to differ from the case in the case of the judges of the U.S. judges.
The Judge has pronounced that police officials have wrongly violated the citizens' rights of thousands of people, targeting the Black and Hispanic men with its breakdown and cruise program.
He has appointed an outer monitor to monitor major changes in policies, training and monitoring, and he is most likely to stop where he has ordered a pilot program for testing the body’s wear cameras in some campuses.
In August, the city of New York, whose cases have been denied after a police stop, agreed to terminate the practice of people's names and addresses.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.

A trial was filed in 2004 by four men and became a case of a class action.
The supporter of the change in the NYPD's break-up and currencies program said that inappropriate behaviour would end up shaping a more reliable and effective police force and could affect the use of the policy of the other police department.
The opponents say that the change will reduce the police's mood, but will solve a comprehensive problem of a police force under pressure by thousands of police officers after crimes, money lost and not over the past decade.
The judge noted that there was no ending for relapse and cruise, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
The training included a large number of participants in Goda, Pakukur, Jamsheedpur, Khanabad, Hazaribag and Chatra districts.
Over the period of seven days, all participants were informed of several students, including Tent Piching, Flag Pol.

Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
News of the World's Spiritual Editor Andy Colson has been accused of having been a secretary of Charles Clark's house during his stay in the field of a so-called secret information confirming and attempting to "hack" the phone.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis K.C. told Old Bailey that the news of the world had heard a mistake in May 2005 that Clark had been meeting his "attracting special adviser" Hannah Pobbley.
The court said that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glenn Mulker to hack Polby's voicemail and to "hold" that nose, but Kolson also called and left her voicemail.
Mr. Edis said, "The suggestion of the party is that Mr. Colson, who is currently editor of N.O.T.B., should not be standing outside the house of the people, but keeping articles in front of the people, see what people are responding to."
They said that N.O.T.W. used three ways to investigate cases: phone hacking, monitoring and amna-amna-amna.
The third group included its own editors.
He knew the other way he knew about Nigerni, he certainly knew.
What about the first ones?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He said, "No, we said, "Yes, he knew."
Afaha was first introduced by A.O.T.W.'s function desk on Clark's trials at that time, when a sexually desirable source in Sushi Polby said: "Don't miss your time, he's with Charles."
In August 2006, from home to Mulcher, at least three times the Voicemail tape was captured on the Sunshine Polby's phone.
The investigators also found such entries on the private investigator's computer, on which Sushi Bobi and her sister were called the "project".
During the time he was under investigation, he was asked to call his grandfather and grandfather Gumnam on him at the time.
During this period, the main reporter, Neville Trurrbeck, and the reporter, James Vedraup, saw the supervision of the arrival of Sunshine Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told them via a webmail, "I have found a story we're planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles."
Ms. Edis said the involvement of Kolson in this case is in a parting with other important individuals, such as former home secretary David Blanket.
The court heard on Tuesday that Kolson talked to Mr Blanket about a married woman's trial relationship, while at that time he was seeing the case of co-contracting Rebekah Brooks who were married at that time.
Colson and Brooks refused to abuse with other people to hack telephones from 3 October 200 to 9 August 2006.
Mulker, Trurlbeck and Vederup have accepted the phone hacking.

The German media called for the hope of expressing the presence of the Lisning Antenna from BfV and signaling a exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clepper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, said the United States has said its foreign Intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and to increase their international competitiveness or increase their lower lines."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who made Viselblower, has begun to tell the U.S. supervisor his secret treasure, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director does not follow his words.
The U.S. National Security Agency said the Brazilian oil company was investigating Petrobras, including our cloud suppliers Google and Yahu, and Yahu expressed fear of government surveillance.
The last thing happened when it was discovered that Cansler Angela Marcel's phone was bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the business leaders of the world are certainly also targeting potential targets.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be practical to use these data for the mutual benefit.
"Germany should be awakened," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by German companies in July, the U.S. has now become almost high risk such as China, when it comes to industrial intelligence and data stealing.
According to Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence that the United States has left the secrets of foreign businesses for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the absence of the European Union's Internet capabilities and should try to reduce their dependence on the United States.
The business leaders are doubting this.
The German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
Haso Platner, the German Business Software Company SAP, said "This is not a way."
If a strong European IT industry wanted, he would not have died 20 years ago.
Everything is in Germany, from coal, to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
It has been revealed by Snowden as a plague to some companies who previously believed to be the largest surveillance threat of China.
There is a major change in the cloud computing branch where European officials are more aware that data stored in the United States is subject to that area of rights and therefore potentially become sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by a trade institution, some 10 percent of non-Americans planned to use an American-based cloud provider after uncovering the data-prime mining program.
Jim Snabe, chief executive officer at SAP, said: "We have seen a new question that didn't come to customers a year ago - it's - my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that area of right?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports just have already confirmed what they have already known: that the powerful state wants to steal their most miserable secrets and data, and for this reason should be laid at any cost.
That economic shock is not a surprise.
This has always happened.
"It's a topic for many years, and through the basic current discussion, nothing has changed," said Kart Bock, Chief Executive Officer of BASF.
The U.S. is investigating us at the commercial and industrial level and we also do it, because it is in national interest to protect our trade.
Corporate leaders are generally not willing to deal with the defense system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For large companies, it's not worth leaving a mess record from home for a long time, it's not worth leaving a business from home with usb sticking, or it's not worth leaving a laptop missing in a hotel room at least to say.
Ulrich Hackenberg, car manufacturer Audi, says that it's a simple old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings as its use can't be as remote hearing aids
The German executive BfV advises you to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when negotiating for the risk on smartphone tours abroad.
The prepaid cell phone was released later.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, it is open to many companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium sized companies often lack experience, to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access to employees and financial resources," the BfV report warns.
The U.S. has warned other countries about its own businesses' economic intelligence.
According to the Washington Post, in February, the name of the U.S. National Hoffia with Russia and Israel, named after China, for economic information, in the hacking in another trailer of convicted criminals.
According to members of the board of the German Blue Chip Company, when it comes to economic investigation, "French is the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French Internal Hoffy Agency DCRI, said in an interview: “The services know well that although all countries are engaged in non-terrorist struggle, they are investigating their colleagues.”
The U.S. is investigating us at the commercial and industrial level and we also do it, because it is in national interest to protect our trade.
No one is foolish.
Georgia's teenager's parents believe their son was murdered in an unfortunate accident.
A Georgian teenager whose dead body was found in a rasterling mate at his high school gym, believes that his son was killed, the family official said on Tuesday.
Valdosta, G.A.'s Central Johnson was found in a straight standing mat behind his High School Gym Blairs on January 11.
According to investigators from London County Sheriff, Johnson died in a "unique accident," but the family of a 17-year-old boy rejected it.
Kenith and Jackie Johnson's presenting official Benjamin Cramp told Fox News Dot Comm that "he must fully believe that his son was killed."
He hasn't even believed in the death of the sheriff.
He said, "He must believe that this is beyond the logic of physical rules and general intelligence."
They believe that this is a consequence for the safety of the person responsible for the death of their son or of the people.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a book-bag, and he returned to a body bag."
U.S. Secretary-General Michael Moulre said on Tuesday that he is investigating a formal investigation into Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are considered.
What was the cause of death?
Has he been murdered by a crime?
Mure said this on Wednesday at a journalist's conference.
I'll follow the facts, they'll take us anywhere.
My goal is to bring the truth.
"I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation," he said.
Mure told the reporter that the snare test showed signs of Johnson's death as a result of "positive breathing."
According to Moore, a different cause of death in a second shot test has been found."
He said, "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Mure also said that if he has enough evidence to investigate a criminal or civil rights in the case of Johnson death, he will tell F.B.I. to do so.
Representatives were not immediately available for comments from the Office of the Laundez County Sheriff on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, the jury of South Georgia ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents are saying that they are hoping to find some signs from the video footage how his death was.
C.D.C. issued instructions on children's allergy for schools
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control children's food allergies in school.
The U.S. government has issued such directions for the first time, as the number of children who are going to school is increasingly suffering from food allergies.
In the U.S., every 20 children are allergic to food.
C.D.C. found that between 1997 and 2007, food allergy has increased by 18% in children.
This guidelines inform schools how teachers and employees should be informed of the food allergies of children, and how to handle them in the situation of no allergic reaction.
Schools have also suggested that they hold a stock of apeninephrine in order to face the possibly known thrillery (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the Apen brand which is most commonly used.
The State Assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily hold stocks of apinephrine in more amounts.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms communicated by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
The kids can say, "It seems like something is going to be in my mouth," "It seems like my mouth has hair," or "It's going to be lying in my mouth."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children's 'language unspecified'
Germany has become the first country in the European Union, which has granted recognition to children born with unclear Jannaung and to the third ling.
The newborn children will no longer be specified in the manner of male or female.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare sex to such children, this law allows them to declare sex on the child's birth certificate "defined" or "unspecific".
The new law aims to reduce the pressure on parents who can make decisions related to sex-specification for newborn children, and to fight against intersex children's contradictions.
According to B.B.C., an intersex person said years later, "No, I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to be a co-created, co-created physicians.
According to estimates, every year, one of 2,000 children is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersex, part of the group of about 60 situations, which comes to the end of the investigation of sexual development disorders, is a common term used for unusual characteristics, genealogies (indexation or dissemination), or unusually developed ling.
It may be that Valis Simpson is intersex.
The linguistic identification is still not correctly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when the linguistic cannot be determined, it is better to use the existing best information to specify the linguistic identification. And to make the physics-developmental methodology and psychotherapy, if such anxiety occurs,
The New York City psychologist, Dr. Jack Drasser, who is a specialist in Ling-Identifying cases, said the new law of Germany "ass good thing."
Intersex children create ethical disagreement.
"Some people are in such a situation as a life-stress that requires gym-medical treatment, but not with most children," he said.
You can specify the ling without shelter medicine, and then see how the identification is developed.
In what way a child will develop a lingerie, science is not very accurate to know.
No one can answer the reason why this is happening.
It's a kind of poetry why people are gay.
In the report presented in 2011 by the European Commission, intersex people have been described in different ways as transsexual or transgender people, because their position is not related to the ling, but is neither female nor female or female or female or biological composition.
These characteristics can show themselves secondary sexual extracts, such as muscle weight, distribution of hair, chest and length; primary sexual extracting such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in the structure and hormousity.
This report also provides an overview of the disagreements faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as of exacerbations, violence and secret crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-informed males.
Australia and Nepal have already been permitted to mark adults on their official documents male, female or "third ling".
In June, the 52-year-old Australian North May-Wellby became the world's first recognized "infinite" person after winning the legal appeal.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the third specification will be as X for intersex individuals in the German passport besides M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, the issues related to ling in neighboring countries in France are still contradictory.
In 2011, dozens of French methods-instructors from this strictly Catholic country signed on a petition to return the "long theory" from the school's books.
The U.S. Catholic website online also opposed this German law, saying, "While the world is going in such a situation, where the link is choosing options, but not sexual activity, we are going in the opposite direction of two and the columns of civilization."
The mother of a newborn baby in Maryland also told the baby John that she would like to see the baby being specified during birth.
He said on the website about perversity, "perversity is very stressful without additional limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's relationship is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, men and women who were born with both genitals were called hermaphrodites, who were called the name of the beautiful Greek goddess, who were twinling.
And even less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the ling as a slide that could be removed and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of gym-therapy, they understand that ling recognition is a complicated job, and sometimes it can be wrong with doctors, who don't know what their ling definition will feel when they grow up.
"In the midst of the first century, it was called "a medical emergency."
When these babies were born, you wouldn't call a psychiatrist, you wouldn't call a gym.
The existing theory of treatment for children with unclear genitals was presented by Dr. John Money, who considered the Ling reconstructive.
He argued that the social and environmental signs - how parents dominate the child - are acting with the child's genes and hormones by determining that he is recognized as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/John", their theory became controversial.
He advised his parents to take a child, whose child was an accidental couple during the Linging Linggrihar-Ureleddin (Sarmssion), to take him out of the child's mind and to make him like a laughing-travel girl.
Drycher said, "Meni presented the case as a successful case of the status quo, but he did not."
At the age of 15, the baby turned her back as a man and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he killed himself.
Drycher said that some doctors are still following the "Usci" form.
But with the arrival of the Internet in the 1990s, these men who had been through skincare began to come in front of "unfortunate of the paranim."
The same case was with Montana's 36-year-old author Jim Bruce, who was born with X.Y. male characteristics, but his genitals were unclear.
The doctors did not clearly understand that his wing was small, or his goddess was great, but they were sure that he could never live "satisfied life" as a man.
So, after some time of her birth in 1976, Bruce's outer organ and Ankosh's shelty-treatment were extracted and became like a superstitious girl.
She was given women's hormones at the age of 12 years.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was hard to ask.
At the age of 18, he had been vaccinated with him.
But feeling depressed and some dizziness, he asked for medical archives.
He found out about the terrible truth.
When I was born, I was injured - and no one told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented her body from producing testosterone in sufficient amounts, which could not develop her genitals in a reasonable manner.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, took the dose of testosterone and removed his chest.
She was defeated because of shelter medicine.
Today, he explains to people to make their concept of intersex individuals in an interface project organization.
However, the modern group of California-based Advocates for Informed Kways, Annie Tamer-Matis, expresses concern that the German law invites "chip and coach."
They say, "Too many activists believe that the German law will encourage parents to make quick decisions and to specify the child's "defined" decisions."
We are afraid that this will encourage the intervention.
We think it's better to define a male or female sex than to wait.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only predict it.
Tamer-Matis said that his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in third-language."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about more sex," he said.
The law of Germany relates to specifying it at the time of birth.
This isn't the problem that newborns are fighting at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their body themselves.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Arlene Bath, whose daughter is sexually disrupted, and who assist hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law will provide "power to both parents and children."
Baratji's daughter Katti was born with male characteristics, but she was known as a complete androgenic insensitivity memory called D.S.D.
Since his fault was in the hydrogen grade, women's extraction in Katti developed.
Its body has ioni, but it is not pregnant or disproportionate.
The 29-year-old Katty is married and is a resident in the Department of Hair Psychology at the University of Pensilvania.
Although he is bonded, he hopes to become a mother through or through a gas stationary surgesic.
"This law enables parents to make their own decisions soon," he said.
It provides them with reasonable understanding and time by some testing before writing “men” or “woman”.
In this way, you stay well - love the baby, love the baby.
You have a nice baby and enjoy it.
We don't need to do a sweat-treatment that can't be returned soon.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees them from the opposition that inspires their parents because they do not believe they are doing well," he said.
Finally, the child will determine which kind of gender is easier with -- and this will be a very good thing.
This enables children to make decisions for themselves.
The legal awareness camp was held by the Committee's Chairman and Chairman of the Committee by the Tahsil Ligal Serious Committee in the chairmanship of the Committee of the Medal School of the Romanger in Delher, in the presidency of the Jazz Sadip Kuar.
Students and other people were given information on the right of education and financially for previous people.
At the camp, Advocate M.L. secretaries, Rohin Burdwag and Sarpanch informed the people who were talking about the subject.
There were a large number of villagers in the program.
Report: Think of the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, the close advisers of President Barack Obama considered Hillary Clinton's tickets to Beaden's place by calling Vice-President silently for 2012.
The most notable threat in the mystery is that Mark Halperin and John Haleman's heavy expected 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change the game 2012."
Tims received a copy of the next book and said on Wednesday evening that the President's top advisors could help Obama resuming the expectation of the election to find out what the bombing biden could help to see the "wide group meetings and the late polling in 2011".
Time National Political Speaker Jonathan Martin explains the book's full information on the campaign of the main officials and put the bill of the former White House's chief staff for the name, to know what the secretariat of the former State Clinton impacts on the Vice-President.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the basic shape of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval office.
Only half a dozen of the president's close advisors – including the Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and the former White House senior advisors, David Axelrod and David Pulofef – were aware of the changes.
"Double Down" claims Dale attempted to change Biden despite his personal Tamil before making a final decision when his information had been reported to him, there would be no improvement in Obama's status from Clinton's ticket.
In an interview with Martin, Dale confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton in place with Biden.
"He looked at the whole scene, and one of them was that," Dale said.
Remember that at that time, when the governor was in danger, we were in such a manner, "Holy Jesus, what shall we do and what shall we do?"
While Dale told the research as "cautious", Martin had told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign once again invested significantly in finding how much this claim would profit when it was Pol.
"The campaign does not spend on voting and focused groups such as money until they are considering something seriously," Martin said at ACC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew their team was looking for changes.
Martin told CNN that he asked him if he knew his boss about the potential change?
While Dale said that she didn't seem to know the president about the potential changes," former Chief of Staff said it was "possible" that it knew Obama.
"Double Down" is certain: did the political investigation come to Obama's desk by not responding to it?
Kuper asked Martin whether he was seriously aware of Obama Biden Dumping Ticket Research.
"It's possible," Martin said.
Do you like ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first Glo-In-Dark Ice Cream - Gelfish.
Charles Francis has benefited from a lot of marine animals to develop the best breakfast.
He came to read a research letter on the idea, and China's assured scientists re-used the chemical light on protein.
Ice cream, foods that respond to the mushroom will increase the pH levels of protein and the ice cream will be shine.
Chris says the ice cream is enlightened with the reaction of the heat of the mouth, i.e. the more winning it will be enlightened, the more it will be enlightened.
The founder of the Ice Cream company, Charles, said, "This is an incredible thing at the beginning of the day production will get me about £200 of 2 grams of goods."
The protein that we are using in ice cream will react with neutral PH in GJB.
As soon as the mouth becomes hot, protein pH levels will increase and ice cream will shine.
We've been testing for the past few months and it seems perfect to share it on Halloween because it has a wonderful brilliant effect
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the glass of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So I'm going to get a cost of around £140.
It's a good taste, though.
The experimental company based in Charles Bridge is famous for its unusual taste, including apnea, beer, pineapple, meat and gold.
But his next creation has been proven more important.
"I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream," he said.
This is naturally impossible because of the ice crystal that makes upgrades above the ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is used by a counterfeiting properties of a jellyfish, which has been composed by Chinese scientists.

The fire party was called to save a lost P.P. on the mouth of a disruptive mountain from 50 feet above the ground in a warehouse
Cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after arriving in a small street torque
Three days later, he was watched by a dog-woker in the castle.
Fireworkers dropped the front part of the rock out of the road to save the dog from the mouth of death
After P.P.A. had hit him on the mouth of a shocking mountain over 50 feet of the soil, he got a happy life by calling the fireworkers.

George Kerevan: Euro Destroyed Choose Scots
One day, another story of fear of independence
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join E.U. as a condition of membership as an independent travel area throughout Europe.
Passport control on Berwick and signal stories about the limit of the continent wire on the walls of Hedrian.
It is true that the Stratclide Paper described the potential economic benefits of independent voices with the rest of Europe, although - predictablely - it was not described in the Headlines.
No one has described that E.U. Members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, so Brusels will actually be a cheap discount for non-compliance Brusels instead of getting it from Scotland.
That's why, again, A-Khanni.
And the thing that has been fractured for so long has been depleted. First, I heard the news about 40 years ago "the meaning of freedom is passport control."
However, this interesting old story has lost an interesting point in listening to it again.
Why should we expect Europe to be biding independently from Scotland?
Why are you going to take action for London's yoke in Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, war-made plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, the project has officially died in Europe.
In the entire U.S., the parties are getting stronger to oppose the U.S. or to close the euro as the same currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptil Internet Party - which has been established this year - suddenly received about fifty million votes in the federal elections of September, and thus offset offsets. Free Democrates (we influenced our Lib Dems)
The EU's plans to build Europe have always been domestically opposed.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be a change.
As well as the strict rules imposed by the Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project has gone far away because of the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
There wasn't much of the euro's impact in the excessive budget of national governments - that was only true in Greece.
On the other hand, the Euro system has stabled its members with the exchange rate of German exporters - what German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currencies unemployed, South Europe is in a state of harm inherited to its productivity compared to Germany.
The only means is to reduce pay and public business - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Europe's profound productivity has suffered somewhere further from current budget and currency problems.
In order to provide discounts to the French and German energy firms on the basis of consumers - as a result of the "heated" energy policies imposed by Brussels, the European Industry pay four times for electricity and gas compared to the United Nations.
This is the damage that we have already seen in Grandmaut.
Even if all of the world's wages are sold, the European Petrochemicals industry can't save from being affected by U.S. Shel Gas.
As a result, the feeling of revenge in people, particularly in France, who was ever the chief fan of E.U..
After the U.S. U.S. top politicians saw Germany as a means of maintaining control over Germany, and providing Paris with equal billing in the world.
But Berlin no longer requires Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies in Europe, which is why the economy of France is devastating.
Consequently, the Southern Front of Marian Lee Pen, E.J. Anti-National Front, has won the power-made sociallist on third place in the recent subjugation.
Currently, the front is the most popular party with 24 percent votes in France - it is a warning for the British Lab that they can't believe they're going to run for the left, even the profits for the right will be.
What's going on with his new fame in the French gowns, working class?
The party wants the use of E.U. elections in the European Parliament next year to create E.U. Anti-, best-in-value anti-goth.
If, as far as possible, the E.U. Anti-Party performs well in these elections, this kind of defeat can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is that in Europe, E.U. will soon end the euro's sham of anti-order and best anti-order emotions.
The euro will not end completely, but it will come back in any form like "Europe of the nations" such as the Futkar, which will be supported by General De Gall.
Germany and some of its diverse economies can retain the euro, but France and South Europe will restart their currencies.
I hope that the U.K. will keep itself away from the project in the hope of increasing closeness with the U.S.
However, increasing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the Cold Atlantic.
What's going on with the most recent Scotland?
We can choose to be a region of Lithuania (i.e., necessary).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Bruce to be different at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better work in the European system, except that we keep our own currency.
It will be easier to work together with other countries with equal thought in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic independence on the way to Norway.
S.N.P. Government in Scotland - notably - is the most successful anti-militanti-political campaign in Europe, which was proposed by Laber's Cansler Elister Darling. Assaulting (and active) Ghartham's reduction in the year 2011
Voting for independence for Scotland at this time would be absurd, as in that situation it would have to be accepted by the rules of the regime imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Along with the time: grow up soon.
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls are getting younger than their blonde girls.
Physical change doesn't mean that youth is weak.
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be convicted.
Experts believe that swallowing propulsion can be a cause of younger ages.
The case of childhood hasn't been so effective in boys.
The C.N.N.'s former speaker Pat Ethariz is a reporter expert in children's health and family issues.
What should a mother be worried if her daughter begins to develop breastfeeding at the age of 7 or 8 years?
This week at the annual conference of the U.S. Hair Medicine Academy in Orlando, Florida, the hair physicist Dr. Paul Caplowitz explained that these are the initial physical changes in American girls. These are the common ones in the new currency
Caplowitz says, "I spend a lot of time trusting the fans - that usually doesn't show rapid progress towards full-life."
Direct symptoms of development, such as breasts, hair and garlic, as well as physical smell in girls, appears from time to time.
However, in the last four decades, the age of Resolution (first monthly-therm) has been very modestly changing.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years in the first resilience," Caplowitz says, which are also authors of "time-to-time prejudice in men: the guides necessary to tackle this common problem."
The most accurate testing time for youth development.
What is the beginning of the yogurt, there is a discussion about it, but when there is an increase in breast growth before the age of 8, two call it "baby-aged."
In most cases, this procedure will become slow or stop - whose hair can be monitored closely by the doctor.
In a state of faster progress, an endocrinologist may need to investigate so that tumors or systems can eliminate the possibilities of serious problems such as the system.
There are treatments for premature monthly heat and other results: premature age increase of the diseases, which can cause an inaccessible increase and the natal step as adults.
The drug or hormone treatment depends on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are sad about drugs, but admit, "young pressure can increase emotional issues, and girls can feel different from their partners."
The second major problem can be understood: Aspirator simply doesn't want his younger daughter to be monthly-hearted.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy, or then what they're going to keep healthy," Caplowitz said.
A woman, whose daughter had started a monthly religion at the age of 10, remembers, "It was a hit."
Although they were symptoms of this and we were also talking about monthly-religious, it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school, and he was troubled back that he was the first monthly religion in his colleagues.
There are many pronounced principles about the causes of unchemical life.
However, there is no constant evidence that milk or other foodstuffs can be charged with hormones, chemicals or sexually oriented messages in the environment.
The boys, like the girls, are getting younger people from time to time.
Caplovitz this rule determines that its main cause is the breakthrough of the sickness.
In 2001, he assisted girls over 6 to 9 years of age to run studies, which combined body fat with childhood time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get their blonde girls before their age.
There are a lot of explanations about this.
At the global level, the reflection of time-for-earth, from economic situations to weather and genus, all things seem to be affected.
Other poetry: Although the boys are getting hair of the face and jeans in less age, but the movement of the juvenile is completely unclear in them as girls are.
Other doctors attending the A.A.P. Conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in children and children, it has become common to see the hair of the skin and the hair of the skin.
Dr. Laurens Silverman, a hair physician at the Horeb Childrens Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about it. How do we do the real start of the year?"
Do not hesitate to take advice from your hair physician to consider how to talk to your children.
Caplowitz advised, "This meaning can be discussed before the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond correctly.

On large orders of jet manufacturers for seat width disputed.
There has been a rope installing a fight for Dubai Air Force this month among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-distance flights
The dispute is focused on the width of the economy class seat in the aviation of long-flights, always as provided by airlines whose installed space efficiency is claimed by Latest Jet Arabs SAS and Boeing Company to be the key.
This week, Arbus has hoped to set at least 18 inches (46 cm) in an economisch cabinet this industry standard, but it should be decided by the airlines, according to its main counterpart Boing.
The controversy between aircraft manufacturers occurs when the potentially enrolled aircraft connections on a long-distance order after the event of 17-21 has failed to sell the large version of the engine.
How is the last section of the aircraft built - particularly if the setup is 9 or 10 equal to more capacity to consider the design of mini-jambo jets is being prepared?
Boing said it was the "777 X" that will hold 406 people in a unitary division of 17 inches and 10 people in one row.
Airbus said it would take 350 people into a seat that was left 18 inches equal to 9 inches.
Airplanes often trade in commercial press via advertising on technical issues.
Now, with Airbus 777 X, it is hoped to have more than 100 orders in Dubai, which is calling for further public.
Recently, it's been seen that something has been happening at the beginning of the war, these Finnesero showing it together in a restaurant with three together, would you accept it?
Airbus Sales Chief John Lee said he "is also offering long-distance flights from Boing Regional turbo."
As a change, people are getting larger, but the way to seat the plane isn't changing.
According to the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when Boeing 747 Jambo was not a modern ki long-term travel co tha, and between the centuries me 40-49 years old American Nar to weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average man's room in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
According to Airbus, its rival has been attached to a seat concept of 1950 when the new name "Jt Set" had a breakdown of the average term.
Airbus said he has established a research committee that suggests an additional inch of 53 percent sleep quality improvement in the seat width.
Boeing disputed on the seat measurement of Airbus, saying it is not dependent on the manufacturer's decision how airlines hire and facilities can be balanced.
It also says that the research shows that more than a seat's width depends on the experience of the cabin.
Boing Kebin's expert Kent Craver said: "It really tells the airlines to provide flexibility and trust in what they need to do to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what the benefit is."
He knows his business better than anyone else.
It's about the cohesive room for flyers, but it's a quick issue for suppliers that it can affect income.
The trade of at least $700 billion behind this dispute is sufficient in the coming decades to rise the competition of the airline order in the US and European exports.
The raiter's report said for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually a fighting issue between new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing have claimed that 20 percent per seat have been performing in their new connective angel design, the leader of that section, compared to 365-Cit Boeing 777-300 R.
The claim of Boeing's performance depends on the 10th 777 X Own original 9th 777 design.
The cost of the unit is now equal to 10 profits.
Kevin Kennedy, head of the European Airbus passenger facility, says "Boing is trying to capture more on seats to make their aircraft more competitive with our products."
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-Cit-per-line cabin is suggesting for the existing 777 S that many passengers are on the side of the layout, which can go with cheap rentals alongside.
Kabin's internal expert, my Karby, founder and editor's Ranve Girl Network said, "It will be very good for passengers of eighteen inches of seat width, but the reality is that Airbus's trade point proposal is operated by the threat of 777."
Airbus and Boeing seats are not supplied but are providing a list to choose from suppliers for airlines.
Jet sellers around the world also take care of checking this layout competition.
With more relaxation, all builders are also providing high-density layouts for low-cost aircraft services and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal to A350 but it is not sold yet.
However, until recently, Airbus has dropped extensive cabinet seats on some of its jet aircraft for the need for more cabinet facilities.
It is unlikely to fill a new industry standard flight without the support of other modern jet aircraft, but it can distort the selling of 777 X.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine can end up smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can end the enjoyment of smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to keep nicotine blood safe for the entire lifetime.
Testing on humans is required before starting and testing, which may take several years, but the professor Ronald Crystal of the Wii Cornell Medical College in New York said the oral signs are positive.
Professor Cornelius said, "We are very hoping that the strategy of this type of vaccine can eventually help millions of smokers who have used all the methods that exist in the market today. We have attempted to overcome the powers of smoking, but they have
The new vaccine has a harmful virus, which is prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus, selectively infects the intestinal cell, which begins to form a lasting thread of its subsequent antibody.
Antibodies search for any nicotine in the blood, and prevents them from rising under nicotine inside the smoker by impacting them on the brain before they reach the brain.
In the test, the vaccine was given the sugars that were subsequently given nicotine, they were performing their normal activities.
The researchers say that but what wasn't given the vaccine, it was "good," it was a sign that nicotine had reached her brain.
This experiment was described in the journal "Science Transnational Medicine".
The first tobacco vaccines failed because they had antibodies.
It had a dosage at regular intervals, so that the antibody level was made, but it became expensive and ineffective.
However, the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very much, as the intestinal cell will make an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future was completely safe, it could be given to children, before smoking cigarettes, so they could be saved from nicotine blood.
But it will probably be used to leave smoking by individuals who smoke.
"They will find out that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habits.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they warned the need for a lot of research.
Even after postmartm, Bagini's death was unable to stand up due to the real cause of the death of Bagini.
In response to the balloon on this, the first view is declaring the death of Bachin naturally.

We are denied to be influenced by Tripode Obid.
The former NSW Labour Minister, Joey Tripod, will be investigated by the State Carpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joea Tripode has refused to request his political master AD Obed, former New South Wales protector AD Obed, whose government-controlled three landscapes were hidden.
Independent Commission Against Discrimination (ICAC) on Friday investigated that,K, what Mr. O'Bid has infringed the ownership of the policy of the bands from several state ministers? Where O'Bid's ownership has two restaurants after the time of 2005.
Lin Ashwell, the former Deputy Chief of Staff's witnesses on Thursday, knew this accused's Mr. Tripody's secret statement of Mr. Obid? is now being investigated.
During the years of the discussions in 2005, the government had pressured to launch a public tender for trails.
They were against it and they wanted time.
In 2009, the round company for strips, which made Obiid earn 2.5 billion dollars of Salana, was renamed from the band band without strips.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Gates from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially on the side of the public band.
But he refused to change at Mr. Obid's request, Mr. Tripodi called for change in the government's tape policy
In August and September 2007, ICAC introduced a comment in a telephone call, Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripody and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to Mr. Obid's vote department after working in the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Assistant Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. "What was the telephone discussion in the development case of commercial tape policy, was discussed?"
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I couldn't remember what was discussed, but it was certainly not.
Surely not between me and Mr. O'Brien.
Officials say that Israeli fighter aircraft have spoken to Syria.
Israeli fighter aircraft targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Wednesday night, a senior administrative official confirmed the fax news.

Israel has attacked missiles in Syria at least twice this year.
457 External Employees may have passed "certification" tests on Visa
A "certification" test for foreign employees on 457 visa is being considered by the government, as its aim is to extend a strict operation.
If the test is adopted, it will be implemented through a standard made to prevent the 457 attempted family and friends by way of filling or pursuing special positions in Australia.
Today, a government debate was issued, deciding the government's vocabulary on foreign employees, pre-leaver M.P. Maxin McKu said today that it could crush Australia's neighbouring countries.
He said today to the U.S. Indian Institute that "external people are arriving at the end of Katar" and that "Australian people first work" is a very unpleasant repetition at such a time, while the Unions have been demanding a secure labour market."
Historically, it's demonstration was that Sweat workers should be secured - and if some people in the region have seen the reflection of that historical evidence, I won't be surprised.
The discussion letter illustrates the form of 12 measures, which were first considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Branden O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the people who laughed, has implemented five item changes, while the rest are considered.
If the "certification" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be investigated that "what appointment is true in such circumstances, in which the designated person, the owner of the person or the corresponding person is a partner or individual associate."
Employees may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, as first employers who wanted to organize employees in a small number have put hundreds of people at work.
During this time, a 35-year-old Shri Lankai Sharan Sahdah died of heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island after a suspected ship.
The person's very nine-year-old son had travelled with him to Australia, and on Wednesday, after his father's death, his older brother, Chicheri, was tied to a ride, which was on the same pottery.
Australian officials sent the person to the Iceland Hospital where he died.
The UK government announced a study for the rise in the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
Work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in northern Scotland and England, which will soon start with the first stage in 2026.
Minister of Transport Barones Kremer said the project would "be one of the UK."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said they are very "excited" by working with the British government on this project.
The first step will include the new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leads.
In June, the government amended the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England by £32.7 billion.
The British government, which was talking about Scottish transport, ordered HS2 to consider the possibilities of improving the rail capacity and time of travel for North England and Scotland.
It includes a chance of three hours or less of the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
“Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring closer to the UK and its cities.”
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be much more.
Without this, we will face problems related to the ability of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in the UK, including Glassgo and Edinburgh, which will be well connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elastair Carmichal: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to the "clear" return of Scotland from Mr. Carmichal to the HS2 network.
"Scotland is likely to have a heavy economic benefit from high-speed rail, but it will also increase economic burden on Scotland in the case of high-speed rail across the UK.
Therefore, we are excited to work in the British Government’s partnership, so that we can bring high-speed rail in Scotland, create profits for all and complete the Glassgo-Edinburg Line, which the Scottish Government has already planned.
I am eager to review the investigation report with the British government ministers next year and make decisions on the actions to come forward.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will now be effective in Australia
The U.S. has to continue to shut down its tablets and smartphones while filling and departing while Australian airline passengers are taking a soft step in the equipment-related regulations.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the US airline service companies open to change their processes so that passengers can read e-books during the critical stages of the flight, watch video or play games on their equipment, especially if they are in airline mode.
Passengers can still do this during a lot of flights, but many people don't seem to be able to reach their e-books and so on when they fly.
Australian airlines are considering this decision, according to which US airlines will have to work much more to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it is considering the announcement, but stressed that the ban on the use of electrical equipment in the important stages of flight in Australia is still effective.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations to control the operation of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the Authority said, "this issue comes within the regulations, according to which the operation of the aircraft service is to ensure that the operations are carried out by the operations of the operations of the operations."
Virgin, who is already talking to CASA about expanding the use of his in-flight WiFi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked for further action on the Viniamak's instructions.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in case of allowing the use of electrical equipment, because we really think it will provide customers with a better experience, because we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft.
Quantas said it would follow the current rules.
"Our current policy can't be used electrical equipment during filling and flying, and we don't have an immediate plan to change it," he said.
The FAA decisions are applicable to American alliances.
Thus, we always have an interest in financial developments that can benefit passengers and we will definitely consider the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind them.
The impact of this decision, each US airline service company will be different and will depend on the age of its aircraft.
Air service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio operations from their mobile devices, as well as to modify them in giving their rules books, training materials, Carrie-on Bagage Programs and passengers a brief description.
"After the verification of their airline compatibility by airlines, it will allow passengers to use lightweight electrical tools such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones that capture all heights."
In cases of low visibility, the driver will instruct passengers to close their equipment during the landing of the plane.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be put down safely during the flight filling and landing or in the upper cabinets.
Silver of Ponbrokers due to the difficulty of being felt by the middle class in Singapore

"My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all of our money has been deprived of it."
They say, although they earn 3,000 Singapour dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars), and their husband also employs, but family monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, this is the same demand in South-Eastern Asian parts - where domestic wins are rising - Valumax where they are trading their transactions, this week listed on Singapore Stock Exchange.
Jewelry is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Sushi Amirthaling, 1,300 Singapour Dollars - but almost unsafe bank loans are as cheap.
Ponbroker usually takes 17 percent interest per year in Singapore, which is slightly more than 15.4 percent offered by the U.S. Overclocking Bank, which is the local investor whose branch is in the same shopping centre.
Nevertheless, the bankers have no benefit from the need for credit checks or payments, and they can make more profits than the bank.
The growing expenses of life-japanity by families and the rise in domestic and consumer gains are faced by the difficulties in this area.
A strong increase in the following five years of global financial disaster, and a strong increase in developed economies due to the simple monetary policy, after cheap credits, due to the decline of their economy, the following and medium-sized income families are still in need to meet their needs.

Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer profits in Thailand, which is lightweightly rising this week from the technology industry.
On Thursday, the data has decreased in the demand for permanent exports and consumers.
The Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., economist Sungang Wang Wang said, "A decisive point is that with rising prices, people who come to the middle of the lowest class will try to increase their income in the best possible way."
Historically high values in gold values in the past two years have inspired people to keep personal assets falling, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to swallow the value of their family jewelry.

People say, "The feeling of sleep looks good, let's keep the gold chain of grandmother falling, and they'll take it back next month.
Thailand's largest ponshop operator, Egimni, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using their outlet in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of keeping the fall that the outlet operators in Bendimir, Valumax and Singapore, are planning to expand 15 others, not only in their neighborhoods, in Malaysia, where there are four shops or businesses where it is going to be, but also to expand out of Asia.
The company's finance, Singapore Stock Exchange, will use 60 percent of 66 million Singapore Dollars in this week's listing.
While some discount lanterns (winners) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Sushiyah says that holding a drop does not only get cheap rates compared to other winners, but it does not directly increase winnings.

$325 Million Savings Package for Taxi Health
The U.S. government stressed that there are also strict conditions associated with the $325 million rescue package for the Tasmanian health system that is going to be sick, which will ensure that the state government can't afford money.
Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, has announced that the National State is "acting immediate action" to resolve the existing conflict due to the high rate of the population, the disease of the island, and the limits of the system.
The decision of the finance-consuming conducted over the four years was consulted by the government with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
"The sheriff is a emergency rescue package, which is our belief that it will solve particularly the challenges faced by the state."
The $325 million package also includes an optional surgical plan of $31 million.
Autopadic and Motiabind Surgery Summit 2600 additional operations will help resolve the previous collected cases.
It has a vacation-in clinic, better care after going from the hospital, training of medical professionals, personal mental health services and local hospitals. Also welcome to launch the electronic health archive system.

Three members will be formed to ensure that the service is provided as effective and efficiently as possible by the State.
Mr. Wilki said that the meaning of $325 million would not be much, "there are no real improvements in reaching the Tasmanian public health system at a more flexible level."
However, they praised the government to respond to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought before the Prime Minister in early May."
Mr. Vilki said, "I hope that the federal aid package will be very helpful in separating the State Ree Public Health System from the hit-grate list."
According to the State government, these additional alternative processes will primarily prevent recent cuts.
But the Federal Opposition Health spokesman Peter Dalton believes that today's announcement is a "band-ad solution."
He said from A.B.C. T.V., "We are here because the Lab State government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You can't believe that $300 million is taken by the State Government and that $300 million is given by the State Government as a good news day.

The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its ability to make chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria has destroyed the important tools to create chemical weapons and jearil gas war materials, while the conflicts emerged in the northern part of Syria, which are very close to the place where the toxic agents have been put in place.
On Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the Syrian home war, which started three years ago.
This announcement was one day before the last date of the Chemical Weapons Organization on November 1st.
The Hague-based organization intended Damascus to destroy all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to fill the machinery used in war materials or "ineffective" to make them.
Mainly completing the initial stage of destruction, this important event is the stone of Satch Mile, aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Damascus until mid-2014.
Destruction means that Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still destroy the existing weapons and collection.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1000 meters of tons of chemicals and weapons, including Masterd Gas and Narve Agent Siren.
Britain's status Syrian Observery for Human Rights has reported that the announcement occurred at the time of the rise in the struggle in the city of Safira on Thursday, about which experts believe it is a center of chemical weapons production and also storage unit.
The Movement Group, which describes the number of deaths through the Syrian network, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.

Since then, he hasn't updated the data.
About 20 million people are forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's military party had been fighting against rebels in Saphira for several weeks, many of which were associated with al-Qaida groups.
On Thursday, Observatorie said that people were arrested on both sides, but he clearly said nothing.
This represents the threats faced by war, chemical weapons inspectors, who have a very short-term mission of ending toxic weapons in Syria during the War of Homeland.
In a statement to O.P.C.B. working together with the United Nations, it said that its party "is very satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all Syria's declared important production and mixing/disambiguing equipment - as a destruction."
He also said, "There is no plan of inspection activity yet."
Inspectors said at the beginning of this week that he had completed the first stage of confirmation work on 23 of the 23 centers declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to go to two centers for security reasons.
The O.P.C.W. said on Friday that the two centers were "attended and... the chemical weapons items contained there were sent to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether one of the two centers in the Sapphire, where the O.P.C.W. inspector was unable to go.
Syria has proposed a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will be approved by the Executive Committee of O.P.C.W. next month.
The Deputy Director of the O.P.C.W. Observatory Group, Ahmet Uzhuku, said, "I congratulate you on the strongness and satisfaction of the people in fulfilling the most challenging mission that has been done by this organization so far."
This home war has been running for three years mainly the government of Assad and its security forces, including members of Alawait Panth, and the conflict between the rebel Sunni Muslims.

Afterwards, the real owner of the land had been charged with the police and the administration.

Assault on the punishment of a bombing explosion in Bali
In 2002, the families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in a bomb bomb bombing attacked the bomber's death penalty, saying Umer Patech should face the fireing party.
Patech, who ran as one of the most desirable individuals in South-East Asia for about 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
It can be released in 15 years after the parol is given.
The 45-year-old Omer was found guilty of two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of many other allegations about terrorism, including a series of bomb explosions in the church in Indonesia on Christmas East in 2000.
Prosecutors have requested a life penalty, although they could also claim that this person who is called the "developing person" as a bombing master is the death penalty.
The decision refreshed the painful memories of the women in the fort, June Cortin, who had lost their 39-year-old daughters in the devastating attack by Pattek and his co-workers a decade ago.
Stoping his accusations, he said that Patech had to be sentenced to death.
I really feel that he had to be punished by other terrorists as well.
Sushi Courtin said to the A.P., "He should be standing in front of the fireing party."
I have to live without my daughters and daughters every day.
After completion of the night at 11:00 p.m. on 12 October 2002, after the explosion of the bomb loaded out of the entire club, the nomenclature of the club was met.
Peter Hughes, suicide bombers, were at the padding bar just 20 seconds before the bag was exploded with explosive material by the suicide bombers.
They were "deceased" three times while staying on life-protective devices as a result of the incident of the bomb.
Mr. Hughes said that Patech had to receive the same punishment, which was responsible for this period for the three other members of the Territory Party - Amrogi, Mukhals and Imam Sea - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given death sentence before someone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, and there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and killing injured people, 20 years of punishment is not enough.
Patek, Bali is the last person to be punished by the explosives.
He was rescued from being captured for nearly a decade, but finally in January 2011, he was captured in Pakistan's Ababbad, where the U.S. Army before Alkhaida, chief Osama Bin Lahad, had been killed less than four months later.
During the trial, F.B.I. Agency submitted evidence that the report showed that the contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda was in Pakistan in an attempt to re-established bill transactions.
Sushi Courtin says, "He didn't sacrifice himself."
Even today, it is not really sad that so many people are suffering from mental suffering.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by the events in Bali and Australia.
Sushi Courtin said, "This year there will be a lot of noise."
The petitioner can still appeal against his punishment.
F.A.A.: Air infiltration can now use gadgets in air (but can't call from cell phone)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but they will not be able to talk to their cell phones with anarchist - this is the case on Thursday - by the Federal Flight Administration.
However, passengers should not expect the immediate change.
In a news conference, F.A.’s director Michael Huartha said how quickly these changes are being carried out, it will be different in each airline.
F.A.A. will have to show how their aircraft, new guidelines, and guidelines are fulfilled, including training members of their driver party. How are the books and the rules to collect devices?
F.A. said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Jetblu are among those airlines who have already submitted plans.
F.A. said in a statement, "Depending on the state of the plan, we can accept the extensive use of the electronic device very quickly.
Currently, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door is closed.
They are expected to not drive them until they arrive at the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to re-stop their device while departing from the plane, and do not drive it until the plane completely departs.
F.A. said, under the new directions, such airlines whose airlines are fully secured by electronic regulation, they fill their passengers with flight by plane, departure time and taxiing time.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher heights are expected to meet these standards.
The President of the Association of Professional Flight Atendant, Laura Gladging, welcomed these changes.
"When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work with airlines to do so - it will be a winning thing for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we feel like the "hall monitors" have been upset.
The agency said it would still be prohibited to surf, donate, send or receive messages, or download data by connecting to the Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet.
Travellers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there can still be no conversation with friends, such as online screw games, with which the famous event associated with is that when actor Elec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the door in 2011, he had been deported by them, and American Air Force was flying to stop the device by them.
And laptops such as heavy equipment, etc. still have to be collected because the other person in the cabin will be worried about injury from their destruction.
The phone calls will also be banned during the flight.
The Vinyamak rights related to the telephone call are close to the Federal Communications Commission, not the F.A.A.
During the filling and departure of the aircraft, some electronic devices can remove the ban on F.A.A.
Last month, Mark Rozencan of the National Transport Safety Board, who is a national transport safety expert from C.B.S. News, said the cell phone is still considered at risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, but not because they may possibly create regulations in the navigation-related device, but also because they can create regulations in the cell phone towers when they are in the air."
The World Industry Advisory Committee formed by F.A.A. to examine this issue has stated last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure has risen over the past few years to reduce their use of restrictions.
Sen. Clayer McCaskyler, D-Mo, said there is no legitimate cause of security for the drug.
It is also difficult to implement these restrictions because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also show that nearly a third of passengers have forgotten or ignored the instructions to shut their device.
The F.A.A. began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996, when the F.M. Radio and high-tech gadgets of that time were reported in navigation and communications equipment.
New airlines companies are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved to be resilient to electronic intervention by F.A.A.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi from passengers to crossing heights for many years.
The modified aircraft for the W-FI system are also more resistant to regulations.
Huarta said most airlines companies should fall down on the criteria for more use of electronic devices within the end of the new direction.
Today's electronic devices, the previous generation's electronic devices are emitting very small power radio broadcasts.
For example, e-readers, it is a totally nominated transmission during the patch of the page.
However, the transmission is strong when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com is also part of those who are taking sides to reduce the restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded their entire e-readers in the airlines and flew to test the problems, but there was no such problem.
The F.A. Advisory Committee expressed feelings about the risk of using the device.
Doggles Kid, the National Air Force Passenger Association, said that he believes that the device's regulation is real, whether it's a risk name.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the provision of the aircraft system, most of which are too old.
However, the members of the Committee stated that F.A.A. Pilot would allow them to disable the device when flying in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group welcomed the changes and called them the general knowledge feature of people traveling in the latest technology round.
U.S. Trawal Association C.E.O. Roger Do said we are pleased to recognize that F.A. is not incompatible with passengers, protection and security travelling with pleasure.
The U.S. police, learning from the bombing bombers in the attack, have taken the room for the cvik reaction during the emergency situation of the security boss and during that time.
Running the traffic arrangement in a good manner, preventing deprivation of deprivation, arresting the total 1800 soldiers of the city for deprivation of deprivation of other deprivations including teaching the deprivation of deprivation.

Birds were left back in the forest for safety from North C Rig
The Northern C oil rigs of the birds have been abandoned to the forest from the beach by air transport.
This water rail bird, named Scotland SPCA, was sent back by Eberdin by the previous helicopter after he had been recovered to his Eloa safeguard center.
"This water rail was probably the winter bird of northern Europe, which came into a quick air chapet over the northern sea," said Colin Saddon.
It seems that the bird was tired and he took the oil rig.
He said, "He was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
Before leaving, the water rail was healthy and smooth.
Is Europe ready to do business with the UK?
The business for the UK was launched in April and promised to bring the business together and to determine that the UK’s employer and enrichment manufacturer wants to see what changes in our relationship with the UK.
For him, we conducted the largest and most detailed surveys of UK professional leaders and asked them what they think about the UK business with E.U.
U-Gov has thought of 1000 business leaders, which are representatives of the business size, areas and locations of the UK.
The findings of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large portion of entrepreneurs want to export out of Europe now, and want to focus on the countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member states are inactive.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, nor are they involved in the long-term and malicious process of improving the secret institutions of E.U.
When they asked their opinions about specific policy areas such as the multidisciplinary regulation to the product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive abilities should come back to Westminster.
The common dissatisfaction could be seen very easily by taking the single market, entrepreneurs say that the price of the regulation of Brussels is somewhere more than the benefits of becoming a part of the trade area of Europe - even huge businesses who were over-the-counterly engaged in these 40 companies.
Finally, and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants to move forward on the way to trade-based relationships and treaty change rather than with the UK, E.U..
The conclusion, which was viewed at the levels of leading business groups, suggested that businessmen are inspired to a "sustaining change", which would give U.K. back its lost power.
Its price is very high - the issue of a treaty change and a better deal for Britain changed 16 per cent votes in the non-assembly, while the party's stay in U.S.U.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: The survey shows that the British businessman, U.S., supports his plan to discuss the terms of the UK membership in the UK.
It also indicated that businessmen are expecting to repeat a substantial change to make the current power balance in the U.K..
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and it is becoming imperative very quickly, as the eurozone, the connected economy and the political union is increasing step forward.
Priority must certainly be jobs and growth in the UK, as the conclusions of our survey indicate that this means for businesses a new focused focus on business and the basic changes in the regulatory functioning methodology of Brussels.
Gazaprom's Elexie Miller announced a new round of pipeline in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said that the collapse of the South Stream Gas Pipeline structure in Bulgaria has marked the collapse of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today a historic event has occurred: the construction of the South Stream Gas Pipeline has changed on the Bulgarian part of the Bulgarian, which is the largest and important project in Europe,” Gazprom’s president Alexis Miller said in a statement on Thursday.

Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, ending the "forever" of the geo-racial risks associated with the Persian countries.
After the operation of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian Customer will receive gas at the rates discounted from the South Stream.
Gazprom said that construction should be started in other Daunstrom countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion ft natural gas.

The Royal Commission heard the charges of sexual crimes against two W.M.C.A. employees before Jonathan Lawr's accusations
In 2011, Karingbah’s hair care employee Jonathan Loard was accused of sexual offences against two of Y.M.C.A.N.W.A.D. employees.
But in his statement, the Commission said that it “sometimes has not faced the case of hair sexual abuse within its organization,” the Commission said.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the case, in which a W.C.A. employee was charged with hair pornography crimes, and another case in which children in W.C.A. Kareingbah Jim was taken care of him in 1991.
The Commission's assisting officer, Gal Ference, said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the Commission's W.M.C.A.'s claim that "W.M.C.A.'s external investigation has been conducted and that he has found W.M.C.A.'s farest in the case of hair protection is not accurate."
The Commission has proven that W.M.C.A. was notified, and received the second minimum rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
M. Green, who is associated with 21 years of age with W.M.C.A., admitted that because of the appointment of Lord, the "Should Me" commitment failed, and that it failed to ensure that employees were informed in terms of hair protection policy.
Lord was convicted of sexual crimes with 12 children during the period of two years in W.M.C.A. at the beginning of this year.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Greene rejected the suggestion that W.M.C.A. had a cultural problem, causing employees not to report a hair protection violation by Lord.
Employees saw about the infringement, gave witnesses to spending time alone with children by lord, begging them privately, sitting in the gates, saying that he loves them and allow them to play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's surveillance, and who had said for hair safety training, because he was worried about his behavior, testified that W.M.A. was at the time of the monitoring of Lord.
C.E.O. said that he did not accept the evidence of employees that they were not easy to report above their employees.
He said, "But with Lourdes, his friendship made his decision to inform him.
M.Hree said he had provided his viewpoint to W.A.C.A.N.W.M.M.D.M.D. that the text was "not to report" to the organization from the "jonathan lord event".
Mr. Hree said that the decision to sign the privacy agreement by employees immediately after the charges were faced, was made by M.C.A.'s baby service by M.M.C.M.M.Whiteley.
Its purpose was to avoid combining evidence, but it was not properly implemented and "excessive."
Special Profesor Stephen Smithson said that during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, WI.C.A.N.D. was not a safe organization.
He said that the appointment, monitoring, entry, training and monitoring of employees had "grave problems."
The hearing has been suspended until December 20.
Blair says they want to return to the UK.
Tony Blair said they would like to be Britain's prime minister again - but they believe that there is no chance of return.
In an interview from the Prime Minister's office for the night at the opportunity of his fifth anniversary, 59-year-old Blair expressed his opinion on various domestic policies.
After leaving his position after a decade in June 2007, Mr. Blair, limiting his comments to his role as representatives of foreign affairs and peacekeepers of the Interim Group, has been very hard to discuss British policy.
When asked whether they would like to return to the prime minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Ioning Standard newspaper saying, "Yes, it is necessary, but there is no possibility of such a thing, so..."
He urged the leaders not to reject the traders' community after the financial crisis.

The Chinese newspaper will be a "Germany"
A Chinese newspaper who had appealed on the home page to leave a reporter for the fault of the humane, he would be given a word of war, a press release said.
Guangzhou's newspaper New Express gave a viral public delicacy for the release of the journalist Chain Yongzhou.
But his subsequent Ms. Chen admitted on television that he had been involved in writing interesting news about the part-owned company of the state.
Vinyamak said that New Express had to go through "complete improvements."
The command came from the Guangzhou Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary survey showed that the New Express of the Yangzhou Awaning News Group published a lot of lies about the company's Jumlayon in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
Vinyamak said in a statement that "The editing of the New Express was inorganic."
He said that he had decided to put an administrative sentence by abolishing the license of Chen Young's reporter.
"He had ordered the Yangzhou Ioning News Group to fully improve the New Express, investigate the people responsible for it in New Express, and amend the leadership party of the New Express immediately."
Mr. Chen wrote in New Express many of the articles blaming financial irregularities in a structure-opposition company called Jumulation.
After rejecting them, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for their release, saying he supports Mr. Chain's journalism.
But after him, Mr. Chen came to state television, accepting to write and publish false stories for money.
He said from state mediator C.C.T.V., "I have damaged Jumloyan in this case, as well as the whole news industry and its ability to triumph in the media industry and people's confidence."
I did this mainly because I was a lot of money and reputation.
I felt my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's forgiveness, New Express released a homepage forgiveness, which said it had failed to check their report properly.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have been dismissed by T.V..
Experts say that profound guilt-revocation is carried out from time to time, despite the fact that a law in response to this year had prohibited officials from prohibiting a person to blame himself.

The U.S.-Mexican drugs have found their own railroad in Surang
The U.S.A. and Mexico have found one of the most complicated drugs toss-ups, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities have described the four-foot-three-foot-surrange as one of the most complex secret paths that have been discovered so far.
Surang is equal to the six-square-square-square of football pitch, which combines Tijuana, Mexico's Samip Godam and San Diego, U.S.A..
This area is filled with a bubble, which makes it easier to hide a drug-filled truck.
The officials said it had been suspended before Surang had passed a drug.
According to the court's archives, officials have captured eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of kokin in connection with Surang's search.
Three persons, whose officials said they were working as a driver, were accused of being detained by Marijuana and Kokin for the purpose of distributing.

The British police sent to the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange today a direct notice, which has been put on the crossroads of Ecuador in London and has applied for the Assassination.
Scottish Yard said he has sent to the 40-year-old Australian Insensitive a "report notes" for which he must be present at the police station, as well as said he will be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
In fact, they are facing appeals in Sweden for sexual crimes, as well as his choices under British law were ended at the time while the Supreme Court had filed appeals against him at the beginning of this month.

He is in violation of the conditions of his career.
Dutawasas refused to comment on the police's notes.
Assange fears that because of the release of more than 250,000 U.S. political cables on a website called Wikileaks, the United States will be sent from Sweden to face potential jailed charges.
1000 pounds to drive the car from 130 miles per hour with hot drinking between the feet
On the driver, 1,000 pounds (£1,000) were charged to drive the car by keeping a hot drink between the feet 130 miles per hour (210 km/h).

Mr. Kuk said: "After the increase in the stamp duty of high-value houses and the proposed anti-avoideans legislation, it is so difficult to discuss that there is no taxation on high-value property. There is no reasonable taxation on the high-value property, which should be achieved in respect of Pu

Scientists have also explained what is the relationship between the dog's hair and his mood.
The previous research has shown that happy dogs hide their dough to the right (such as a dog's view), while black dogs hide their dough mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that partner dogs can identify this sexual misconception of the puppy and can express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in the journal Karn Biology.
The University of Trento, professor of neurosymptomatic Georgia Valertigara, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and left part of the brain is involved in the stimulation that is different from the possibility of the stimulation. In a positive or negative way"
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He said that in human dogs, the left part of the brain was responsible for the arm's wrinkles and vice-versa, and two shooters played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how other dogs react to untruth dumps by other dogs, researchers looked at animals watching movies from other dogs.
He measured the heartbeat of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take a long time to understand why their dome sometimes falls on one side and sometimes on the other.
"We presented dogs with dog films - in shadow-pictures to deal with other issues putting in real-life version or in shock, and we could have seen the harvest of the pound" and put the pound on the left or on the right.
When the animals saw an emotional dog climbing to their right-hand side (of the dog's view), they were completely relaxed.
But when he saw the sun shifting to the left, the hearts of them increased and they looked unpleasant.
According to Pro. Valertigar, they don't think that dogs were consciously interacting with each other through these traits.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience what they should worry about and not what they should worry about.
"If you've encountered other dogs several times, and if they're constantly breaking their heads on one side, it's more related to friendship behaviour, and the left part presents less friendship behaviour, you're responding based on the same experience."
Researchers say these findings can provide better information to owners, veterinarians and trainers about the feelings of animals.
The expert at the University of Brussels School of Veterinary Sciences, John Bradshaw, told dog behaviour that it is not the first study to verify whether the left or left part is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs look at an attacking dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see the happy dog.
In other researches from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Unlike Italian studies, when the robot jumped to the left, it was more likely to reach his closer reach than to the left of the dog, rather than to be selling the dogs."
This was because in various studies dogs did not fully breathe in animals or robot dogs in movies.
He explained that it could help to study the way to respond to dogs by real dogs.
"While there is a lot of evidence from various breasts that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, there is still more detailed information - and there are no exceptions to dogs in this case," he said.
However, which can be easily recorded by his behaviour, it seems to him to see that we may not take longer to understand why his doom sometimes climbs on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Arctic maneuver stopped Glassgo Gig due to Alex Turner's disease

Pope Francis will announce the first cardinal in February
Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will form a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in its office on February 22.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church have top-class supporters, their position is only down from the pope, and these are the people who choose the pope, so Francis will designate the first group of their individuals, which will eventually help in choosing their responsiveness.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching 80 years of age, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope's elections - it comes into the group of 120 "Cardinal voters".
In a statement, Vatican spokeswoman Fader Federrick Lombardi said that before the new cardinals were being promoted, all existing cardinals meetings will be held, called Pope-Sabha.
"Pope Francis has already decided to announce its decision to be held as Pope-President in February to make it easier to plan other meetings with Cardinals from different countries in the world," he said.
Jack Valerio, a Catholic voters, said that the number of cardinal voters would be reduced until February.
He said the pope is generally the number of cardinal voters less than 120, as Cardinals, and, according to his wish, the name of cardinals over 80 years old.
The Pope meeting will be important next year, because this will be the first pope meeting to be elected to France in March this year.
Currently there is a type of prejudice for Europe and especially Italy.
"It would be interesting to see if the new pope, the rest of the world, is also making Cardinals Monotheus to rebuild balance.
In South America, forty percent are Roman Catholics, but their number is very low in Cardinals.
The Council of Cardinals by France - which is a group of eight Cardinals around the world, whose work is searching for the way to improve the Church, will also be the first cardinals to be chosen after being formed.
In the past, the pope decided all things on himself.
"Of course, France has chosen these eight cardinals to help," he said.
He said that it is such a "possible" that Francis would ask Cardinals for advice.
But we're not in this situation before - it's completely new.
Vallero said the pope would typically post the bishop of large places as cardinal, but France "was as surprised as much as possible - so we don't know who they will declare the name."
G.M. calls back pickup trucks in the U.S. to fix the siteback
According to a report from the U.S. Auto Security winners, the General Motor Company, its entirely new 2014 Sheverle Silverado and G.M.C. Sira has a shortage in the hand-driven Setback to fix about 19,000 trucks
In some trucks there may be a reduction in the front seat drilling system.
As a result, the union failed to comply with Auto Safety Standards about Head Records.
According to a report on the National Road Transport Security Administration's website, "if the vehicle falls behind it, it is possible that the head register cannot protect the driver in a proper manner, thereby increasing the risk of injury."
The recalled models were made between August 1 and September 10.
The G.M.'s truck began to be sent in June, and the year after the 2009 Diwalian renewal represents the most important wagon launch for U.S. Automeker.
G.M. told the owners of the truck about this fault in the answer of October.
The 16-day N.S.T.A. government detention, which blocked the rise in auto sales in October, was unable to review the notification letter.
G.M. said on Friday, in the sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks redesigned for the 2014 model year, there was a 20% increase in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 serial pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, G.M. shared 1.4 per cent in New York Stock Exchange.
Deception of Obama's voters
I voted for Obama twice in expectation of change.
They say that the great efforts of Obama have been restricted due to G.O.P.'s policy of opposition.
The policy of opposition of Obamacare's website can't prevent drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign reminds us of what could have happened.
Nathenial P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books today.
This is a book that I think it will excite my excitement during the second year's poisoning of the medical school and will bring the range of expectations in me.
Its name is "the courage to go" and it is a memorial of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.
When I get rid of my patients' beds at night and go to bed, this book takes me into a circle where politics has inspired millions of people and could stop your breathing speech.
The election was proven at once, and the news spokespersons had taken a break to show the historical importance of that time.
My colleagues were surprised in the eyes of the co-authors, and my parents kept the letters of each meeting.
A party of young televised individuals was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, he had 82 percent approval ratings during his office of President Obama.
Then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, such as returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a remote memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
The first time I voted for the first time, there was actually a change.
In a simple way, none of them could have imagined it.
I'm ranking Obama for a lot of achievements, taking our army back from an Affordable Kyer Act, from Iraq, "Don't Ask" to the end of Osama Bin Laden's death.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposition has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country: including immigrant improvements, public options for health services, shutting down on Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But as soon as I take the Obama administration to my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer to the end that I can give them.
I have come to the point of political disappointment.
The Republican anti-policy is not the response of foreign leaders, nor is it the response of drone attacks on Mussom children abroad.
This may not respond to data collection by the National Security Agency on the privacy of Americans, nor can it respond to protests against people who are revealing the government’s wrong crimes.
Without any trial, it cannot be explained the cause of the killing of American citizen Anvar L.A., nor of the limits of public funds and businesses that were reduced during the campaign.
It cannot respond to the conclusions of the report, which says the attempt to silence the media by the White House is "the most aggressive ever since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, it can't blame the failure of designing a simple website after three years of being signed in the Law of the Non-Portable Cair Act.
I don't know what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I had to assume that the government system could accumulate the political campaign that would lead to it.
It is directly that the elected office is not a preliminary path, as anti-political parties and random events such as Newtown assassination will shape our public discussion.
However, as I have given the above examples, they mostly seem to be chosen by the administration itself.
This makes you the most troubled.
I re-vote for Obama in 2012, but not because I was romanced with her expectations.
Mith Romani presented a confusing and uncertain option, which seemed not to define his policies or his position.
I thought a second run for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of the future elections, will fulfill the hopes we've been hearing about for a long time.
However, while Obama's appointment rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return through that book in 2008.
When I saw him, I remembered his missing conversations.
A part of the book was reading this week, which described how Pennsylvania had not suffered much damage to Clinton due to Obama's primary.
In a post-mart campaign meeting, he told his undertaking employees that he needed to return to the patrol, and that he needed to remain true to his goals.
He said, "I want to get my moso back."
We need to remember who we are."
I can't agree with you for five years.
The opinions expressed in this comment are Nathenial Morris.
Clayve Pammer claimed that P.M. Tony Abbott's interest struggle on the maternity holiday plan
Billionaire M.P. Klav Pamir said Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the maternity holiday plan was a fight because his daughters could be pregnant, and it could benefit.
The Maharth of the mining area, which is in dispute with paying the bill for 6 million dollars of carbon, has claimed, while he has attempted to answer questions about the conflict.
The U.S. Party can control up to four votes in the U.S. Senate, which can be important in determining how low carbon and mining can be done.
But Mr. Pamar has claimed that only ministers can have the same conflicts, and that Mr. Abbot's daughters can benefit from policies personally.
"Every parent may have an important conflict of interest in the case of a mother's holiday, because if any of her daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest in whether or not they have a holiday."
Two months after the election, the election committee officially declared Mr. Pamer winners by 53 votes of the Fairfax's Sunshine Coast Seat after falling.
Mr. Pamar has called for the winners of the election count to advance the process rapidly.
Toni's daughters are French and Bridget.
What is the result of the election to be held by us two months later?
"We should have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which we fill up our disruption on the computer, vote immediately and have results at 6:30 a.m.
Mr. Pamar also criticized the use of the pencil to sign on the ballots.
That's because if someone doesn't like it, they can remove it.
The use of pencils in today's circle seems to be totally uncomfortable.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Pamer said his policies included the construction of an international airport for Sunshine Coast, and they would take their new work "very seriously."
The public office is for public service.
"We have no other awards besides the awards of history that we can serve the community at this important time," he said.
That caused the speakers to be disturbed.
During the discussion of the meeting at this opportunity, the Association President Ramesh Singh Neji expressed intense attacks on the progression law-law in Pradesh.
He said the officials and their families have proved to be the rapidly growing attacks on criminals.
There is no fear of police and administrative arrangements on them.
Recently, he mentioned such incidents in different places that when the official is not safe in society, the security of the general man can be plainly alleged.
RBS has suspended two Forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its foreign exchange department, the case has received this information from two people, this is another sign that the suspicious currency market is growing in the shareholders.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclay, Dush Bank and RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market with $5.3 trillion donations each day, they are working with shareholders in the investigation.
These two traders will be RBS's first employees, which have been concluded with the investigation of the case that appears to be the recovery of the Libour Interbank Heather Cand.
The Bank has rejected commenting on the Nilban confirmed that the Bank has received a request for information from the bankers this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation is going on in this case, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other shareholders."
Last month, experts of the case said that RBS sent to the pre-trader and received from them emails and archives of fast messages to the UK Viniamak, Financial Advisory Authority.
Richard Juscher, this trader left the RBS in 2010, and it is believed to have been released from its current position of European leader of Forex spot trading in J.P. Morgan.
The leading Rohan Ramchandani of European spot trading in the city went to last week's holidays, while the former senior Kerenci trader in Barkley and UBS was established this week by the Standard Charter.
None of these have been accused of wrong actions on any trader.
In the case, experts said that Mr. Jusher's quick messages group included Barclays and the bankers of the Sitigroup.
UBS said that, after the Swiss Vinyamak, Finland has been told that he is investigating the suspect Herpher of the foreign currency market in many Swiss backers, he has acted against some of his employees this week.
At least six global authorities - the European Commission, Finland, Switzerland's Competition Authority in VCO, FCA, U.S. Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - on the bankers have currencies to conduct their friendly deployments in the market.
Known people of the case said, HSBC, Citygroup, J.P.Morgon, and Credit Suis were also under internal investigation, or received a request for information from Vianians.
The bank is searching for a misactivated surgical activity for many years with fast messages and e-mails.
The news about the investigation has been reported in the traders of such a region, which have been among the most profitable major individuals in the trading unit of investment banks over the past several years, but they have to face the challenge of this year, because the low-performance challenges in Kernsyz are facing the challenges of the year.
Some bankers attempted to press the case that it is impossible to transfer to the very vast and excessive Liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary to be true.
The senior trader said that despite the excessive amount of foreign currencies-currencies, the decomposition of the liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own influences can start on the platform. That means "you get a little lower value"
The news came on the same day, on the day that Credit Suis announced that the trader would be refunded this week from his exchange trade funds desk in London, which had damaged nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately informed the compatible authorities and is cooperating with its shareholders.
"We believe that the trader had worked alone, and he was controlled."

The Supreme Court has supported the Obama Health Service Act
As a major win for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Constitutional Health Service Act on behalf of Barak Obama.

The first elected president in Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has sworn to his position, but his victory day has rarely ended the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised the "new Egypt" when he swore to take the position as the first independently elected president of the country who took the place of Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
At its official inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morocco became an independently elected first Islamic president of the Arab world, and nearly 60 years ago the fifth president of Egypt after the removal of democracy.
He swore to the edge of the Nile River, which looked like the temple of ancient Egypt, in front of 18 black judges who had been injured by the court on his chair.
During the official broadcast on national television, Morsi said that "we are looking forward to a better future, New Egypt and the other government."
The group of the Muslim Brahmoud, who has been 84 years old as an unlawful declared organization since its establishment, and who is on the signs of the previous governments, is the trained engineer of the party in the U.S.-Life in the U.S.-Life,Natasha - Natasha, 60-year-old Morossi said "Az Miss

Only a few hundred supporters were gathered outside the court to give the new president to Mubarakbad from the time of Mubarakh, and the transport was also stopped for a little while, so that their motor is usually the busy streets of the south of the city.
Brenderhud's non-Christmasy "Hali Tire" has increased much in the personal reputation of Morsi who is flying overhead after his victory, and his speech on Friday wanted them not only to do the work of Islamism but also to perform the work of 2011 as the candidate of all those who were presented as candidates.
Morsi, wearing a blue-color business dress and red-tail, swore to the position of judges sitting in the wooden panels, saying, "Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern nation."
He then went to the Kairo University, where he had to speak his opening speech.
The military band was officially welcomed by the National Shuan instead, while they were standing in the currency of caution.
The military headquarters of Marshal Hushan Tantavi were also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the interpretation room at the main university there welcomed the narrative: "Army and people are a hand."
Founded in 1908 as a branch of religious proportional education, the Cairo University later became a branch of Islamic students in the 1970s.
Morsi on Friday swears at the Tahrir Square, which is the original place of the revolution, which ended the reign of the throne of Bavaria last year, and was removed from the military council leader by Shenley last year.
But in practice, by agreeing to swear to the court, rather than to be able to swear to parliament, they swear to the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morocco's speech in the Tahrir Square was filled with popular native currencies.

Khan has been responsible for this, stating the government that its security has been removed for political reasons.

I'm living in the warriors that call terrorists.
A security document of CRPF at my home was placed in the Aguai of all inspectors.
I've also been in charge, but I've had all my security suddenly taken back.

According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore over the past four years to celebrate the anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Instead, during the reign of the NDA (between 1999 and 2004) of Modi's claims, a tour during the stay of Athal Vihary Bajipaye's PM, when no advertisement was issued by the government over the Patel continuously for two years (2001-2002).
Based on the 182 metres height of Sardar Palace's Stachu of Unity image in Kevarda in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Palace's jaints before.
While the DAV record states that UPA spent Rs. 4,10 crore in 2009-10, Rs. 4,10 crore in 2010-11, Rs. 2,7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs. 1,4 crore in 2012-13 on the advertisements of simple patels.
When Central Information and Transmission Minister Manish asked about Modi's claims on Tuesday, he said he was not talking on the basis of BJP's PM Candidate facts.
The UPA did not have any advertisements on the patel in 2008.
That was because of the economic rape that year.
Although the money spent on the advertisements of Sardar Patel is significantly lower than the money spent every year on members of the Nehru-Gandi family and on the priorities.
The DAVIP was spent on Rs.9.38 crore print ads for Mahatma Gandhi's death and recurrence, 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crore for Indera Gandhi and Jawahar Red Nehru.
When Manish asked about this difference on Tuesday, he said, "This should not be seen by the view of the expense on advertising.
Because the price of advertisement depends on many things, which include advertisement signs or advertisement rates for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it reveals our commitment, whose opponents have attempted to deal with the conquest of a great leader without going on to it.

Progress from soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well is providing free health services in the rural areas of Cameroon
Weal and his party watch hundreds of patients almost every week.
There isn't much more medical in Western Africa; there is only one medical for 5,000 people.
Give your vote here or via mobile.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for someone in the top 10 to make the CNN's hero of the year.
The winning person will get $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to Hosea and disgusting, going to the hospital, which were not adequately equipped to help him.
Jameel Vel was injured in a car accident in Cameroon's capital Yunde in 1981.
At the beginning, only his arms were broken, but an infection increased that spread to his brain, and he produced a ratcarbude, which affected his rest of life.
Georges Well said, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would take our father out of the camera.
Instead, Veal was picking up a large crowd of clinics and hospitals with his father and receiving him whoever could be treated.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5:00 p.m. expecting you to be the first person to arrive in the hospital, but not so.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait for death to be in the mouth.
There has not been much change in the situation since the death of Vel's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, there is a doctor for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And if you are a doctor there, too many residents of Cameroun can't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country win down the poverty line, and nearly two-thirds of the healthcare business in the country is private sector.
Well said, "The only problem is poverty."
And because they are poor, they can't enjoy their lives.
Seeing his father and his countrymen's suffering, Weal made a strong decision to resolve it.
Dr. Georges and his volunteers have treated 700 free toiletries last year.
They also became a physician, and began to work as a vascular surgeon at the Yundee Center Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organization Eskoyim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they sit in Van and up to 30 people, take medical supplies from the roof and go to rural areas where people need treatment.
Sometimes there isn't even a variety with them.
They have to drive the vehicle from rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they get them truly honored heroes: the best accommodation that can be offered by the community, singing and dance.
The free medical service in these villages is really a reason to celebrate, and Vel - with its great smile and infinite energy - includes happiness-happiness.
The next morning, his party begins to meet hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We meet 500 people in each trip."
They come from the village to about 60 km away, and they come on foot.
All these clinics provide various kinds of medical services for the weekend.
Many people are treated with malaria, therapeutic, abuse, mudmy, peripheral and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may be sitting, donated glasses or free birth certificate -- this document requires the school but many debris family can't cost it.
In the evening, the party treats simple shelter with local understanding.
Operation is usually the school building, Town Hall or home; after the procedure, the patient goes to the recovery place, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator publishes in the operational rooms and sanitation equipment, and weal and their volunteers work up in the morning-morning Sunday.
This is a short speed, but the village musicians usually help to keep the party inspired.
Weal said, "They're sleeping all night in order to keep us alive and continue their work."
On Sunday, their party returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group - including Cameron's physicians and foreign medical students - has 700 free medical professionals last year, and they know that their assistance can change the world of the people they help.
One person said that because of the free treatment of hernia, she would be able to go to work again.
He said, "This will change the future of my family and my family."
In addition to working as a shelter at the hospital for the weekly clinics, they also work in private medical clinics around Yandue at night.
He said that this is his second job that finances 60% of his unemployment work; the rest is complete with private donations.
Kathy O'Malley said, "I don't know when they're sleeping."
They are always in hospital or are trying to make money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to participate in the campaign of Vel, are an experimental opportunity for them that they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "We are able to help in Jin-Shill Medicine to capture drugs for Dr. Well or clean the blood vessels, in which we are able to obtain experimental experience."
In the United States, you will never get an opportunity to do so as a second year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pass by themselves to reach Cameroon, and they often come with medical donations supplies.
However, after the arrival of Yunda, they are incurred by the cost of Ana-Knana, and the cost of instructions.
O'Malli said, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives to this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron will never end.
As a matter of fact, there is no difficulty in working like that.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill the promise made by their father, these are the things that make them very happy.
Well, they say, "I'm so happy when I do this job."
And I think about my father.
I hope they will see what I am doing.
I'm doing it to laugh at people, to reduce their pain.

Mr. Kerry, speaking via the video link at the Free Government Conference in London, said: "There is no question that the President, I, and other people in the government really knew about some of the things that were happening with automatic pilots, because it was as sure as they looked back in the 9 years of the second world war, then the capability, and the Cold War.

I'm sure there's nothing wrong with people in this process.
