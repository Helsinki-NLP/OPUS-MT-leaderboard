Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev’s leadership on Monday of refusing direct political discussions with Eastern Ukraine’s separatists.
At this moment, Kiev’s leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said in a statement by the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-speaking separatists who say Kiev and the West are the assistant of the Russian army attempted to push Ukrainian troops far away from their momentum places where Putin said the Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The aim of the militants is to remove these armed forces and their forces so that they will not be able to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was organized on Friday and Saturday at the Rirmkorjaamo.
It surprised me that the bowl came from the beginning.
Visitors were expected in two days, promoter Tom Kangas said.

We are still going to have hiphop festivals, that is, poppy is not allowed, Kangas convinced.
In Finland, a law which restricts the acquisition of explosives suitable for the production of explosives will enter into force on Tuesday.
In the future, individuals must request permission from the Police Government to purchase or hold in their possession substances or mixtures that could be used as the so-called source of explosives.
Such substances are water peroxide, nitromethane, nitrogen acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, as well as compounds containing them if the specified concentrations are exceeded.
Waterperoxide is, for example, in cleaning and washing substances, but the concentrations in them usually do not exceed limits.
Nitromethane is used, for example, at acceleration time.
However, prior to the entry into force of the law, the derivatives acquired must be held in custody and used by 2 March 2016.

Election: Super Raheem lights - Mario stayed in the shadow - Election - Night-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lanella was an electrical atmosphere on Sunday, when Mario Balotell’s fortified Liverpool arrived at Tottenham’s guest.
Super Mario’s first initiation was promising: experienced English providers saw a 24-year-old Italian work in a very different position than Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his top.
The Italians lost three high-quality paintings and only half of their sixteen shots into their own team.
The players who are already preferred by the player will expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers settled the role of Luis Suarez to Barcelona as a second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The team’s star starred the top of the middle-field timantin Raheem Sterling, who overthrew Hugo Llorisin’s important 3-0 victory.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just work.
The Balotellia is 20 centimeter shorter in English between the opponent's lines than in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who will be grateful for his best to run at about 34 kilometers of an hour.
Rodgers also deserves a great gratitude for Sterling’s development.
After the match, the Northern Irelandist told him how Liverpool systematically developed a more comprehensive player from the rising Wembley’s trustworthily lottery.

Ovarial cancer dies more frequently due to delayed diagnosis and access to complicated treatment in rare areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of death of ovarian cancer than in cities.
In 2005, more than 1100 Australian patients with ovarian cancer diagnosis experienced data and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after the diagnosis.
Researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in rare and remote areas are 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
PRINCIPLE: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers have been through women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the moment of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and the socio-economic status influenced the chance of survival.
In elderly women and cancer, the lowest probability of survival was when diagnosed with more widespread cancer.
Women living in rarely residential and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not endeavour to find out why women outside the cities are less likely to survive ovarian disease, but Jordan considers it possible to cause delayed diagnosis and difficult treatment access.
"Gynecological oncology specialists best treat this disease, and their reception is mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
While distant treatments are in general and the significance of distances is reduced, the researchers also suggest increased mobility of doctors so that specialists can take care of patients closer to these homes, as well as programs to support distant home-treated patients.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the long-term survival percentage of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, the 33-year-old Elisha Neave, a family in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovanieme wants to strengthen the stationary car park activity in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel in Pohjanhov.
The city administration decided on Monday that the Friendship Park and its neighbouring environment’s proposal will be set publicly to see the service point Osviitta.
The formulation proposal is asked for opinions from the Committee on the Environment and the Living Centre of Lap.
The city wants to allow for the continuation of the tourism-related motor tracking operations.
The location is intended to form a park area which includes the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
On the site, according to the proposal, there will be no more than 200 engines permanently from 15 November to 30 April.
Tank points may also be placed on the specified part of the area.
The new park is also allowed for maintenance.
The city of Rovanieme has rented the Friendship Park area for safari companies during the winter season.
The rental contract was last renewed in the spring of 2014 and the contract is in force in the spring of 2018.
Cell parking activities and formula change have also raised the resistance to hard voices.
The neighbouring houses have been sharpened both by their voices and their concerns about their emissions.
However, the emissions of the region have been examined and there have been no observations beyond the indicative values in the report.
Renewable vehicles are also smaller than old emissions.
The friendly park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure is transferred further, the hotel's safari customers should transport safaris to the departure sites by buses estimated at 15 departures per day.
The friendly park’s area and neighbouring environment, according to the city, is also sufficiently wide, better than replaced places such as the eastern side of the Ounasjee bridges.
The Friendship Park is good for its location because the activities can be expanded in the future, for example, to the area of Ounaspaljong.
Establishment of parking is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniem, which aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for businesses by reservation of sufficiently high-quality areas for logistically and functionally affordable places.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point of the motor climbing as part of the center, which has not yet received legal power.
The decline in property will be seen in garden shops
The decline in the number of residential owners, particularly in a group of under 35, can lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, as today’s young consumers are reaching the “main target group of gardens” for their own age.
According to the Financial Times report, renters spend only 55% of the amount of housing owners spend for gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in extremely urban apartments with no gardens. Moreover, the whole garden is reduced when the front door is covered as a parking space increasingly. These factors also threaten the garden area with an estimated value of about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the London subregion, the ownership of apartments has decreased from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, and there is the least cash per household in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), increases the rental of apartments or decreases the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS’s leading gardening farmer, says that “for example, plants grown in transportable farms are particularly popular among residential renters, as such farms can be included in change if necessary.”
According to the HTA report, the 1997-2005 period was a flourishing period of garden sales, as property and property increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will be exploring this year due to better weather conditions, and the weather last year will be harder in March and April.
Turkey hears U.S. diplomacy due to a spy report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has called on the country’s most experienced U.S. diplomat to make an investigation into a report on the American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Vice-President Bulent, the U.S. Embassy’s Officer and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
German Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept have written that documentation by the former analyst Edward Snowden, the United States National Security Agency, reveals Turkey as the main spying for information services in the United States and the UK.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the significance of the report saying that all the large states have stumbled to each other.
The previous report on the spying of the German Enquiry Service to Ankara resulted in a more hateful reaction in the Turkish government.

Majorca Police Chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
The statements of the case presented evidence of the torture by police and officials of the Calvian City Government at the Majorca Public Prosecutor’s office on Friday.
Police chief Calvian, located on the island of Mallorca, has been arrested for the feast as a result of the allegations of corruption made by the movement and bar owners of the famous Magaluf region.
Lieutenant Commissariat José Antonio Navarro was set to investigate after several entrepreneurs of the Punta Ballena Street submitted corruption against him. The Punta Ballena Street is mostly located in Magaluf bars and nightclubs.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the evidence of the case presented evidence of the torture practiced by police and officials of the Calvian City Government at the Majorca Prosecutor’s Office against Corruption on Friday.
The Spanish National Charter arrested two other local police officers in the case of corruption, and they were interviewed by the judge in conjunction with Navarro.
The newspaper ABC, which appeared throughout the country, wrote about the partyality of the hosts of nightclubs, which significantly disturbed their business.
"There's no more money, but survival," a trader told the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries at the headlines of magazines this summer, when a 18-year-old British holidaymaker enjoyed oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the authorities have attempted to stop Magaluf holidaymakers from using uncontrolled and distorted use by reducing the amounts of distorted, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the playhouse, where the oral video was recorded, was assigned to close for a year, and the owner of the night club and the pub crawl organizer were assigned to Carnage for a total fee of EUR 55,000.
First of all, the popular destination of the young British tourists in Magaluf has also become a popular trend in the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents due to alcohol use when people have jumped from the balcony to the other, or from the balcony to the hotel’s swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday at the summer bombers, when the missiles and cranian bombers bombed their communities during the 50-day Israeli and Hamas War and schools remained closed while fighting the region again.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the bombing of missiles in the Southern Israeli communities, but the tracks of the battles are still visible.
In Ashdod’s Pashosh day house in the south, workers removed the traces of the sirrals from the walls and trails before the child’s arrival of the missile in the day house.
“We’re a bit scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in the Saad-named kibbuts, in the Israeli municipality, and works as a English teacher at the city’s school.
Many children in this area need painful routines.
Bart’s eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, believes that returning to school for a long time feels "a little strange".
“We have had difficult times when we haven’t gone home anywhere,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited his support in a kibbuts near the Gaza border.
Before the beginning of the last week's fire break, thousands of inhabitants of the Said border regions had remained indoors or left their homes to safe areas far from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and cranees.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of Gaza are suspected of returning the Palestinian crane killed in the community of a 4-year-old boy.
According to the Ministry of Education, a fair ten families have not yet returned.
Children of these families have been placed in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, near the Gaza border, in a city that was under the heavy Palestinian regime.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised to "care for children's education and safety".
Israel and Hamas have agreed on a fire break that is currently in place on Tuesday.
It immediately stopped the battles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as the Hamas demand for the removal of Israeli and Egypti islands and the reopening of Gaza’s air and sea.
Israel wants to take away Hamas’ weapons and return to the dead bodies of the Israeli military in two wars.
New indirect negotiations in Egypt are expected to begin later this month.
According to the United Nations and Palestine estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of which had civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel did not agree with the number of dead, but at least half of the dead were soldiers, even though there was no evidence of this.
On the other hand, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai employee.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot 4 591 missiles and craneats to Israeli cities mostly south of the battle.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 expressions and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and estimated that 250,000 people have escaped the protection of more than 100 UN schools, which have been transformed into temporary protectors.
With tens of thousands of people still being protected and fighting, school authorities moved the beginning of school last week.
“I hope the school will open soon and we will go back to school, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children,” said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, a protective school in the city of Gaza.
According to the generally used measurement, apartment prices have risen to a maximum of seven years in Australia's winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic apartment price index in the capital of Australia rose by 1.1% in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the rise in summer, July, and August, prices increased by a total of 4.2 percent, or more than the same months after 2007.
The annual price rise was 10.9%, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices did not rise smoothly throughout the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
RP Data results show that apartment prices increased by 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7% in Melbourne in the previous year.
Adelaiden, Brisbane and Darwin’s housing markets are the most volatile; the average price rise is 5%.
The weakest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per year due to government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, spring began in Australia to increase the number of housing in sales over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"With the rise in auction sales of housing, a generally slight sales rate and a continuing low interest rate, it is likely that housing prices will continue to rise over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted recordings to the Month
The new museum and photography have attracted recording audiences this summer in the Month.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 guests have visited Serlachius Museum of Art.
The new Gösta museum was opened in June and there was a show with pop art classics from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
The Month’s photography week once again told the visitor’s recording on Monday, when 14,500 visitors attended the Momenten event this summer.
These figures are not true.
Many have gone through doors and windows,” says director Pauli Sivonen at Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors throughout the year will be nearing hundreds of thousands of Serlachius museums this year.
Over the past few years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
In the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, there are about 11 000 inhabitants.
The museum director Sivonen reminds us that the new museums are always open to phenomena.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue for a long time in the summer.
In autumn, the art museum will open new exhibitions.

Amphetamine lost to murder in Kayana
The disappearance of ten grams of amphetamine was required to bring a murder charge to the Kaiyanist who was born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man and the other man went to the apartment and shot the drugs as a suspect to have an apartment holder, a 34-year-old Kayan man.
The prosecutor contested the charge and claimed that the second man was a shooter.

August was rarely warm in many places.
According to the airline, the same warmth of August is repeated on average once a year.
The statistics of the airline institute show that the average temperature was higher in the entire country than the normal.
In most countries, the difference was one to two degrees.
Due to the summers of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than normal.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in the first week of August in Pora, where the measuring was 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never tried me.
She never said she loved me.
Henry was born to a seven-born family of immigrants from Jamaica in the British Midlands region of Dudley in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died at Henry's 19-year-old boy's relationship with his father was far away.
Henry is currently training for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, which has been developed on the basis of Radio 4 channel series.
The sounds are a mixture of reggae and rappia in upbeat-tahds.
Henry had to go through painful memories of his childhood.
He has often been in therapy after his mother’s death, and he has been thinking a lot about his father’s relationship.
My father was very hard to read.
He never saw his face, just the voice said, "Stop beating."
Leave your sister alone.
Go! Go!
Now I'm looking at the cricket.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer box or the beauty of cricketing.
I've never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life, he was the smiling man in my corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metallic bulb in Dudley and thus got an idea of how his father’s life had to be, although the working conditions are better than at that time.
The sullates are now slightly brighter but are practically dark, smoking, labyrintic depths, where smoke, smoke, and nose are eating and bringing into mind the import.
The father used to go to the bath and only to the ground in the air, and silently he began to sing to himself when he washed the sweater out of himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had done that work for years to get us a food table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood was missing the closeness of his parents.
My father never wanted me and never told me to love me.
Just when my mother began to get sick a little before she died, we began to talk to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter of Billie, Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he missed from himself as a child.
Do you always play "I love you"?
Stop that hate now!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why don't we have friends?
She's a great mother
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he had been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why don't Dawn and I have to be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the causes that led to the death of my mother.
When I began to suffer from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor ordered me to make a full translation.
After that, I started a lot of fitness, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce my symptoms.
It’s very difficult –
And boring.
Nobody enjoys eating meat.
Henry's well-known, short-lived, maybe describes his change during his career development.
After getting a lot of good feedback from critics from their role as Othell, he has been excited to perform the theatre.
The following were the Comedy of Events and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Theatremaking offers a different experience than sitcoms and comedy, which Henry has done for his entire career.
Henry began in the field when he was only 16 years old in the factory.
A teammate noticed him making imitations on the floor and contacted the New Faces skill competition.
Henry's television survey began in the mid-1970s. "For a long time I was the only black imitator and comedian on TV," she says.
Henry learns how to do the work.
I had to grow up in the public lighting language, I had to learn how to produce jokes from the limestone between 1975 and 1985, while I was staring and being on television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the right to play for The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people appeared in black blacks, so Henry ended in comics for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I would never have participated in it, but I wouldn’t miss it.
Although my position was weird and devastating, I was able to work on huge events and learn how the audience was treated.
However, "britti-tv awarded, multi-year-old favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "a wild parody of black people".
Henry worked in the 1980s in a second series of comedians, where both were destroyed and admired by black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was released in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his character as Gareth Blacklock in the Chef comedy series!
In the next decade, Henry spent some ads, documents, TV series and films, but after his 2008 show on the BBC, LennyHenry.tv, he said to himself, “What you are going to do next, Len – now it seems like you are only on your site or on the sidelines.”
The following was the documentary series of Radio 4 "What's So Great About?".
The first part was Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us at school well, and I think it belonged to a white high school that uses sucking shoes and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's issue raised me fear.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: “Try.
Don't give up the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry stated 20 songs about Othello's last speech for documentation and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It seemed like a part of me had missed before, and now it was put in place.
“This is the matter, this is important, so take it seriously, teach your bag, do a small background research.
Therefore, the exercise process was hard, and I read the play for months before it was performed.
The show was finally successful.
It was apparently expected to fail, but it did not happen.
Soon afterwards, Henry played mostly in the Comedy of Events.
Suddenly, I was at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There were technical problems in the game once, and Henry felt clearly that his task was to entertain the audience.
"My little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to leave 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director’s assistant reported that the presentation would be continued as soon as the problem has been fixed.
I walked out of the show, and some of my thoughts would deprive me of ease.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to treat others.
“You are part of the game, stay in your role.”
Henry "Fences" theater Duchess Theatre
Teaching the "Fences" exhibit was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This game was also well received, so it was like a sign of God; "This is what you have to do."
That’s what Henry says with a final voice.
Then I decided to stay here.
I really love this job.
I love the gyms.
However, Henry is still a comic in essence: small humor boys constantly discontinue our discussion while changing his imitation to another.
Stop the stand-up comedy is a matter of will, because getting an immediate gratitude to the unknown public seems dangerous.
If you are constantly jealous of it, it can lead to an injury.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at Apollo theatre when it feels like it, but generally it no longer enthusiasts me in the same way as before.
I'll ask Henry if he's going to go to a new stand-up circle again.
It brings me real joy to sit with a director who helps to modify the whole journey at the beginning, middle and end, and I don’t think I want to ever give up from it.
Is this his new birth?
I think so.
I like to play...
It's really fun.
The show is constantly telling the story, and it is fun.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is preparing a register from officials to remove "morning workers"
Kenya has begun to prepare a biometric register from officials trying to remove "morning workers" from government salaries.
Employees who did not register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government’s report said.
The government doubts that thousands of people will continue to pay their wages after their assignment is left.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised that the public sector’s corruption would be dismissed in 2013.
According to the previous audit this year, for "morning workers" wages and other financial abuse, it cost at least a million dollars a month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account after a person has died or left his official mission, BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reports about the capital of Nairobi.
All officials shall notify themselves in the register within the following weeks in the identification centers to ensure that their information is stored in the biometric form of registration, according to the government’s notice.
As a result of this, everyone who leaves this without a proper reason will be removed from the wages.
"This measure makes sense to the public sector significantly, as it defines how many souls really work in their roles, and also cleans the wages at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of the 'morning workers'," says Anne Waiguru, Officer of the Ministry for Discrimination and Design.
The result of the 2015 financial year may remain a deficit of EUR 25.5 million, unless the city adapts its operations and expenditure in a strong economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the year remains approximately 9.4 million deficits.
Possible efficiency measures included the scale and level of the services, the purchases of services, the sale and grants of assets, and the increase in tax and payment products.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is 8,5 million.
There is no ease for the situation of the municipalities.
New responsibilities imposed to the municipalities, inadequate increase in tax revenues, increasing unemployment and five percent cutting of state incomes are further weakening the prospects.
The aim of the Economic Seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be achieved.
The ship must turn to the strategy's objective, said the city government's President Kimmo Heinonen.
The city government has restored the presentations to be prepared by the headquarters.
The proposals of the city government are based on a budgetary debate at the Economic Seminar of the Authority in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the delegation seminar, the budget proposal goes to the city administration and the city delegation through the board of directors.
Ten Turkish police officers are arrested for suspicion of "young" government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey for suspicion of "governmental protests," local media sources say.
Police have not commented immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, among the arrested were 14 high-value police officers.
Some of the police were involved in corruption investigations last December, subject to government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey accused of organizing and tracking telephones.
Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during that time) said that the part of the police’s actions, Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen, was against him and other in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally an important day for families, and as with thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the expecting journalists that not all schools were reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the land for future generations:
The ceremony of the first day of September were not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian army must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who serves as a leading teacher at Slaviansk school, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first school day include traditionally giving children's writing strips, air balls and flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry said the twitter was unlawful.
The confirmed Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry was sent on Sunday evening a stunning picture of a Democratic pilgrim fighter with the accusations of abuse of power.
The tweet was removed later, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unconditionally from my account.
"I don't accept a tweet and I've removed it," the later publication said.
Perry’s background troops did not immediately respond to the clarification requests.
While tweets were sent from Perry’s Twitter account without confirmation, it’s unclear who published the picture.
The first tweet contained the stunning devastating trailer of Travis, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of rail drinking in April 2013.
Perry stopped the Lehmberg Officer's funding when this refused to leave, resulting in a large hearing in Austin this month, accused of being Perry. Perry is a possible candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the tweet was: "I don't always run in a fool, three times allowed with larger proms... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry to show with his finger."
I'm the greatest Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg Agency did not conduct a large prosecutor's investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio, appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the accusations politically.
His influential legal aid team has requested the judge to reject the accusations and said that the law on which the governors at the most prosecuted office in Texas is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million of State aid to a public non-inflict unit acting in Travis County and taking charges of the public sector when Lehmberg refused to dispatch.
Perry’s decision led the left-wing monitoring group to file an official complaint on the matter.
The Perry confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes also famously.
After reaching fifth place at the 2012 Iowan presidential election campaign, Perry threatened to quit playing a game by publishing a picture on Twitter on the lake linked to the text "Come from here, South Carolina!".
According to Berkeley, the housing market is again "normal"
One of London’s major builders has warned that the Southeast England’s housing market has “returned” to the normal level of activity.
The capital city of London’s apartments have stumbled in a huge demand and a sharp price rise while fearing the widespread credit bowl, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on housing loans in June.
The founder of Berkeley’s high-level building, President Tony Pidgley, said on Monday that “the market and the number of trades have been restored normal since the start of the financial year” and added that this has enabled a “stable operating environment”.
London’s housing market went well during a period of time in the effort of foreign investors to the capital.
According to the Marix Register, the prices of apartments in the city only rose by 18.5 per cent last year and so clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
Average prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about the fifth of the previous year, reaching £423,000 price rise by the end of April.
However, a boosted pound has made a less attractive London real estate object in recent months - some of the interests have also been affected by new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric of possible "map tax" before the May general elections.
London’s real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that a April housing report, which reported more strict loan requirements, would lead to low market growth in terms of sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent information from the UK Bank showed on Monday that the amount of approved loans declined in July, indicating a delayed housing market.
The property broker Hamptons International has declined in London’s 2015 forecast for real estate prices, according to which prices fall by 3 percent, because the price index of the property owners’ opinion has already begun to weaken.
The number of stores made in the most expensive regions in London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has risen in the fourth quarter to the end of the year, the real estate broker WA Ellis says.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, which increased revenue from sales of real estate to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the good-designed, right product demand at the best locations has remained stable, and therefore the sale has remained harvest".
In June, the company reported its sales of 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than before the financial crisis in 2007.
The annual profits calculated prior to taxes rose by 40 per cent to the back of the year, thus 380 million pounds and the turnover increased by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
Pidgley told Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s year’s profits correspond to the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the year’s pre-tax gain is £450 million.
The Berkeley stock sold at the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon at a price of £23.96.
Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures on the web
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to be in possession of hundreds of other star images of the year's Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence on the internet.
The Hungarian Star representative confirmed that the pictures are real and condemned the hacker's "breakdown of privacy".
Officers have been contacted, and everyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen pictures will get charges.
The pictures originally published on the 4chan image page were apparently failed due to Apple's iCloud storage system's weakness. The list of hundreds of other hacking stars is alleged to have dozens of other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not known how much of the pictures are true, however, Scott Pilgrim against World star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at the privacy of my husband and me years ago: I hope you have a good mind," Winstead tweeted.
However, the Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series prohibited the authenticity of the pictures and tweeted that "this so-called naked pictures of me are NOT INTERNATIONAL, do you not understand?"
Let me finish this as soon as it starts.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that popstar Ariana Grande banned the authenticity of star images.
We only have a remarkable extract from Howard Jacobson’s gratitude to the new novel that tells you about love and j.
They dissolved, it described the best thing that happened, and they gradually left each other as if a box left out.
Only at that time she heard from the woman that she was too serious, painful, intense, distracted, and perhaps also a little bitter.
Then he shook his hand.
He recognized a little bit.
Yeah, he was a little bit like a naked.
His last victim was a relationship in the early stages that had been promising, however; it seemed that this relationship could have facilitated his sole boredom, and it might have even brought some content to his life.
Solomons had unrestrained hair and had a delicate charming lovely heart, from the northern village, which was even farther and farther than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with her older travel partner, whose aunt Kevern was supposed to be her sister, aunt had inherited a house that was located in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately the Paradise valley.
He hadn't lived in the house for years.
The tubes were soaked, in all the bathrooms there were sharks, ethans had left their traces in windows, holding the entire place in their own, and in the garden they grew rich grains that resembled gigantic cabins.
The house was like children's garden, at the same time threatening and mysterious, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is awarded the Booker Literature Award in 2014.
Conditions will be published next week
The summer was sitting in his hand with Ailin on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hill, enjoying the surprising warm spring evening, both listening to the sharply challenging recipe, through which the whole land heard the sharp sound of the sharp music and the sharp news of her father, when the sharp sound of the sun of Ailin, and the sun of the sun.
Your legs are too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive, and they were no longer called in the recipient.
They were not forbidden – nothing was actually forbidden – but they were no longer called.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word forgotten.
The general opinion was achieved by what was not achieved by the laws and the proclamation: just as in literature people would choose to read heroic memories, cooking books and romances, with regard to music, they prefer ballades.
When the day was wild, Kevern began with the keys of an imaginary piano, singing serenadia to the grand legs of Ailin with a comic voice.
The unit didn't understand.
"It was a jazz pianist Fats Waller's famous song," Kevern told him, and at the same time raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This is how his father always did before the book "j" screamed in his lips.
It started playing between her and her father when she was young.
His father told him he was playing the same game with his father.
If you saved the word from your mouth with j and you didn't remember lifting two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game at that time, and it wasn’t even now.
He knew that it was expected from him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
I've never heard of this.
Jazzi wasn't really proclaimed, it wasn't just called.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was space in life for only one word.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same way.
Its unpredictableness made people nervous.
And jazz was a nozzle that was introduced through music.
Although Kevern hadn't heard Sammy Davis Junior at the age of 10, jazz musician had become familiar with him through his father's colleague CD.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailin, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There is no need for laws or force.
The reputable society meant that each of its parts accepted as grateful – as grateful, for their savings as luck in trade – the principle that each group made natural things for it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, African-Caribian sucurus people were best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were as though they were talented with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that every family had a functioning phone used to handle things.
Those who remained from the Polish community worked for pipelines; the last Greeks broke the boards.
When SE, THIS, THIS, THIS, HAVE come true, those who originated in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled, feared they were accused of shaking their tears, and feared that they would go to the labyrinth, and they would go to the labyrinth, and they would open their tears,
Let each act according to his gifts.
I had only heard ballads, and he was hard to understand how Kevern’s just-song words that were insulting could have ever been dressed as music.
Through music I expressed love.
“They are not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except for the big fans.
My father never broke anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion about safety.
No word would pass through the sound intake of gigantic cable plants.
I didn't even understand it.
Why did your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers to his lips along with Ailin.
I thought she was strange now.
“It was fun for my father,” he said.
The ignition of the ignition was unfaithful, and his hair covered the Kevern view field.
There is nothing else to see around the world than the giant, dark hair shade of Ailin.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so once," he said, but he didn't hear a convinced.
But it doesn’t explain why you sing it to me.
It seemed to me that I was really confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked at it again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your nickname, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my neck is too thick?
I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for him.
"You're attractive to me because of your thick nails," he tried to fix the situation.
I've turned around in that mind.
It wasn't helpful.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, was missing the convincing charm in which he could control the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe her father was going to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite its smooth eyes.
Solomon's house rose red and rose up on the terrace chair, and dropped the recipient, and poured out the wine they had just drinked.
Wine was only made from the backs, so he couldn’t use it as a cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to be as if the leaves of palm trees were in a storm.
“And your thick head is that which will draw me around in you,” he said.
Except that I don't feel like that.
The summer was sorry for Ailin, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the time that Ailin decided to oppose him.
Did Ailin think he'd beat him?
He had never told Kevern about life in the hype of the northern island where he grew up, but Kevern was sure that it was basically the same as life here.
The same huge, beautiful sea that waved against them.
The same mixed men, yet after TAPAHTUNE, even more clever and cruel than their misleading and dismantling parents, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to strike any woman who would threaten to oppose or tempt them.
A thick head?
He'd still see a thick circle unless he'd be careful!
The first thing to do was to say was the most common erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the first thing to do is to do with the antibodies of unimportant love ballades that pump out of the recipient.
He said that was too much, because the imprisonment in himself was an enemy.
Solomon's body language invited him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace as an old man.
Ailinn also felt as a crash, but the depth of Kevern's sorrow surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They had hardly known each other.
Ailin followed her journey – just as her travel partner looked at Kevern’s journey from the window above – of a man who was himself the cause of his pregnant life.
Adam left the garden, he thought.
He felt compassion for Kevernia and the men in general, although some of them had lifted up their hands against him to strike him.
He turned his back, strange, shameful, slaughtered man, who had lost all the fighting desires – why did he feel that that vision was so familiar with him, even though he did not remember that he had never seen anything before this moment?
When Solomon was alone again, he looked at his legs.
A few years ago, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the General Mielipide in a private institution in Ofnow, conducted a brief research on the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in the regions where the decreasing of violence, or the ending of it, was taken into account.
"The ball has already been achieved, and there is much yet to be done," he wrote, "to be balanced for thousands of years in battle and most often in the natural aggression of the people who have won, especially in those rejected and remote collections, where, despite the widespread churches of thoughts, the human harm has been experienced in the shortest time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it has born.
His people cry about sentimental balladies, tell stories about the winning opposition of Ahmi, and swear on the names of good marriage and family life, but at the same time the old cruelty keeps intact in their way both rural communities and urban communities, and in addition there are evidence of a newly-reaching, even more poorly-reaching workplace.
"You have to regret the tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I would like to read less novels.
The first Nussbaum looked down on the ground.
Also, I have to ask: Are you atheist?
“I don’t have to answer that,” said Esme Nussbaum.
You're a lesbian?
First of all, he still pleaded with the right to not answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I oppose atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There is no prejudice at this job.
We are the servants of an unreliable society.
Although some kind of hypersensitivity itself is fully acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, just what you showed me.
Obviously, you have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or wickedness, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
WHEN THIS IS THE WORLD, OR THE WORLD, as if it had happened yesterday, it would destroy the basic nature of the earth.
The first Nussbaum looked around when talking to Rabinowitz.
Behind Rabinowitz’s head, the flaming pink LED light declared a guide that Ofnow had shared in the land for a quarter of the previous century or longer.
Smile to your neighbour, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit music, use your phone, chat, explain, listen, don't agree, ask for excuse.
Speaking is better than silence, and singing is better than it is written, but nothing gains love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered silently, when he was sure his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine being.
I am worried that if we are not warned, we will see the same errors that were initially caused by SII, THIS, OR THIS.
This time, we don’t get rid of our hatred and unconfidence.
Luther Rabinowitz forms a pyramid on his fingers.
This element meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you're making mistakes, the things our grandparents may have done or haven't done.
You also go too far when you say that they've defeated 'his anger and disbelief to others'."
Someone like you should not have to remember that when it comes to understanding the past, or to defend the present, we do not speak of "we" or "they".
There was nothing 'we' or 'other'.
It was the time of chaos, that's all we know about.
"If we are quite honest, in this chaos," Esme insisted on continuing, "no group of society can say their behaviour is good.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was good or bad.
It was then.
We don’t have to talk about it anymore – we agree with it.
And just as it is unnecessary to share charges, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is any way to make them.
But for what does the past exist if it is not learned --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said that Esmen was time to leave.
The next day, when he went to work, normally, he hit a motorbike with a footwear, whose driving was described as "feastless and weak".
There's something happening.
The Lesothon Army bans a strike on its plan; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho’s military officials have refused to attack the government and said they are acting against police who are suspected to attempt to gun political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and defeated government buildings in the capital Maserus.
The head of the state traveled with his family to the neighbouring country of South Africa, when he said he had received a death threat.
Army representative mayor Ntlele Ntoi refused the attack and said that the army responded to the threat that came from "political fanatics." Police have been told that they were trying to gun fanatics.
“The military’s defence forces took action after receiving a number of surveys that some police forces are trying to weapon young party fans when they are ready to cause problems,” he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to South African Government President Clayson Monyela, the army’s actions seemed to be a revolutionary company.
"Although no party has argued that the government has rejected its power, the actions of Lesotho's defence forces appear to be the symbols of a revolutionary company on all sides," he said.
According to the Lesothon Army officials, the soldiers will return to their Kasar army on Sundays, and the capital had a quiet atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government away from Thaban.
Thabane says he believes he is the subject of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There has been tensions in Lesoth since June, when Thabane suspended the sessions of the presidency due to the disputes of the government.
He denied the power of the government, although it was otherwise alleged.
Microsoft Creates a Data Center for New Zealand
Microsoft has established a large data center in New Zealand where the company does not agree to specify its location.
The company notes that it does not report the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the focus is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In the public, the center was previously established by Oulu or Kajaania.
Microsoft completes Oulu’s office, which takes about 500 people to work.
In total, Microsoft has announced its resignation in Finland for up to 1,050 jobs.
Microsoft’s Communication Director Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company did not comment on how much new data center employees were employed.
The establishment of the data center to New Zealand said on Monday.

Four Tips for Better Water Pictures and Videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, you have to choose a number of different devices options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each of which paid less than $ 350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that should be followed.
Always check your device twice.
Even though you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed with waterproof.
In addition, set the camera description settings to match the images or videos to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have an option to optimize the display conditions under water.
In addition, before jumping into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, others even 50-60 feet deep.
Explore both conventional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and digital camera reviews.
Take a few pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to match the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Although you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and the image can either be successful or failed.
Take several pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows you to draw, which means taking multiple pictures at a time in different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface by photographing your pool, lake or sea.
In this way you will also get more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors appear.
Try to get to the nearby destination.
This is an important advice on the land when describing, but even more important under water because the light conditions are nuts.
It is extremely important when you have an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide screen angle, i.e. the photographer must be close to the object to fill the entire image frames later.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear to fatigue
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates despite the growing, democratic reform-requiring peace.
The decision will likely end the Hong Kong Business Card for long-awaited protests from the start of activists to plan and implement the protests only hours after the release of the decision.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress will allow the Communists in practice to expel all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still irritating," said Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are working with an independent government.
Li Fei, Vice-Secretary of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese administration, saying that being a general candidate in the election of Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when leaving the UK to China Hong Kong, Beijing promised to the residents of the region to choose its own leader from 2017.
According to China’s leaders, the decision was a democratic breakdown on Sunday, because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to control the strict electoral process through the appointment committee that is managed in Beijing.
According to the new sentence, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In the summer before the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most highlighted protests in the region over the years.
The Occupy Central With Love and Peace is largely behind the campaign to defend democracy, whose organizers are threatening to block the business card if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a true general voting right.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main management buildings.
In the memorandum, the movement organizers announced that the movement would move to the new period of civil inconsistency, and they would give rise to protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not report the details obviously fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a press release on the web, the organizers said that the business "continues to hold the Occupy Central temple as the last means to be launched only if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way".
We're very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has been defeated and that the power of the Centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and on Sunday security measures were strictly close to the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, the silence feeds many of the feeling that the inhabitants are silently losing power from their cities.
The wave from Mantere has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, will disappear under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its statements threaten the state of Hong Kong – the business world.
“The protest they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how much it takes and how long it takes,” said Regina Ip, a long-established legislator.
We don't want you to be worried that Hong Kong is going to get rid of us.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
The Chinese state media also presented stories that Hong Kong Democratic activists are the arms of the revolutionary Western governments.”
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on the right to vote with over 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of profitable democracy in the region.
U.S. prom tradition strikes British universities: new students private tickets
We respond to our demand with enthusiasm by establishing the UK's first-class luxury travel form for today's students.
The company also offers other transportation vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival of the university.
Stewart says that the service also has a security aspect.
The service is the best possible alternative for students who otherwise would swallow their property across the country on late cargo cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy and high-grade transportation as possible to the university.
According to the company's representative, the reservation has not yet come because the service has only been established, but added that "the students will start ordering within the next few weeks".
The company believes that the service is in demand, although most students pay £9,000 annual school fees.
Today’s students are very different in terms of their expectations and expectations than they started 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticized a service that is not realistic.
According to the Vice President of the Organization's Higher Class, Megan Dunn, "This service plan seems to be really far from the life of a majority of students."
Many of their studies begin this month are shocked by the level of living costs when financial supports available in the form of loans and loans have remained after the high rise in basic costs.

One bedroom house with a price of £12,000 is located on the private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where your pigs are headed to the sofa.

Basketball: Encouraging fans almost too much: Sasu Salin had to rotate on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the body of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his U.S. match and explained the blood of Ukraine's second half-time by standing solutions.
But Salin moved all the honour to the suffoaches and did it in style:
I had to turn around there at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, but in my eyes, I couldn't do anything.
The black and white sea was almost too much for me.
The power moments of the saloon held in nine surfaces in a fast tail, balloon riders, plates and dishes everywhere it took place.
I don't know how it happened, but I got in such a flow mode that it all succeeded.
They just come from some point of view, now to an unintelligent place, Sasu crashed.
That's my role.
Do everything that's right.
It was great to see that the others were caught up.
It took the whole gang.
Salin is a team’s joy pill and fan, so it’s not surprising that his example raised the entire team’s flight, which was too much for a big and hard-working Ukraine’s five.
Finland in the World Cup after 32 years of pause: The previous game remained tough for judges
Heikki Montonen was the main coach of Finland in the 1982 Argentine Championship.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's flight ball team played the last time in the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finnish double coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remembered the tournament one thing like yesterday: it was the first round match against France.
"In the game's decision balls, the judge's game was so hard," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already been on the back line.
Suddenly, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the pastes would mix more,” Parkkali said.
Finland played chief coach Heikki Montosen in command and finally placed 17th.
Now Finland is once again among the world's championships when Poland's championship will be fastened on Saturday.
Many factors have changed strictly in international airball over the course of 32 years.
The power values of the players are in their direction the same class as before, but the quality and skills are now more.
The average length of the players has also grown.
"The game is even faster," Parkkali said.
But how is it in Poland?
Finland’s player material has expanded, and the load can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the start line.
Then it can be strict,” said Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a battle against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the championship tournament.
Hopefully we're going to hit the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down,” Parkkali said.
Lajilegenda Reino Kosonen was a team of two teams in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö winded in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening care at the Buenos Aires Maritime Church were part of the programme of the country team in the 1982 World Cup tournament.
Kari Kalin (ook.) grew up with his teammates.

The Finnish tourists rescued Cita-Kora from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were struck on the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini greetedly offered help.
Weekend Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his assistants again.
In a public Facebook update, Mikkelsen told him that the Cita dog with him on the mountains on Thursday had damaged his wallet.
The lost dog was no longer able to walk on the ground.
I tried to put it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it be.
I tried a lot of times to attract and pull it a little forward, but his legs didn't just wear, Mikkelsen wrote when he updated.
According to Mikkelsen, there is no help from the police, from the nearby hotel, or from the crossroads.
In the dark of the evening, the situation began to appear threatening.
Fortunately, there were two passengers who were ready to help: Tamperean Antti Soini and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog breast in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells him in the message he sent to the evening.
Soon there was a German man who had a traveler with him.
A pair of couples were arrested by a wounded dog from the patch to Cita.
The German man came for a moment after us, when we were thinking about what to do with a dog and wearing a dog in the heads for a moment from the breast, Soini says.
Photography: Toomo Soini
The dog was pulled down with a walker.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically severe, but in a difficult landscape it slowly slipped.
Around half an hour later, however, Cita was happy to go down.
After the event, Mikkelsen again searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them again.
The voices responded to him on Sunday, but the Germanist is apparently still unavoidable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
They certainly don’t know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soinis were on their way home.
They had received Mikkelsen's joyful announcements: - I'd like to hear another one better!

Genetic deviation is often diagnosed incorrectly
The British woman feared death for years due to misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years to survive because he had a second illness.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Prototh disease (CMT), which means a number of heritage diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK Welfare Organization, the wrong diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as they are so little known.
According to estimates, approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and pain in the arms.
The disease can also cause insignificance or pain, and it is unhealthy and advanced, which means that the symptoms are worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was ill with Friedreich’s ataksia (FA), with a really bad survival percentage.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he was 18 and died before he was 30 years old.
Today, the mother of two children, 51, says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I've been a day-to-day, and it took me longer than any other.
I had never been able to roll or roll with other children, and I was tempted at school because I walked and ran in a different way than others.
When Rodgers was 13, he had several acyl reservoirs to cut off his legs. When the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers where he was told he was suffering from FA.
“I was guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I wrote to the FA Association the information on the disease of the check-in in my home.
When I got the information from them, I was shocked and paniced.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair at the age of 18 and died before I was 25, and I would still lose my entire operational capacity.
I passed this through myself and I planned my own funeral.
Rodgers tells us that at the age of 17 he found that his walk wasn’t worse than he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just threw me and said, "Little girl, I don't think you're having this disease because otherwise you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you've suffered from a significantly less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetics, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
“When I was explained what CMT disease is, I thought I was delayed,” she says.
Charity CMT UK orders the CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

The warriors were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.

Hull washed the attackers with Hernandez track recording
The election party Hull set the recording sum for the acquisition of the Uruguayan team Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will exchange Hulli's Italian expansion from Palermo by £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The deal is three years old.
Hernandez hit 14 paintings last season, when Palermo won Serie B and rose to the Italian main series.
In the Uruguayan team, he made seven paintings in 14 matches.
Last summer in the World Cup final tournament, Hernandez came to the field in two matches.

On Monday, Hull also told him that he had acquired the Senegal team captain Mohamed Diamen West Hammer.
Russian space experiment failed - geets sent to the sex game died
Five small gekkos sent to increase in space have died, the Russian Federation Space Agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
Geko travelled on the photon-M4 satellite for more than a half months.
The satellite returned to the ground on Monday morning in Finland’s time.
The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the reproductiveness and use of geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous geogeneous ge
One male and four cows were involved in the experiment.
Although the test sounds unique, the purpose was serious.
The effects of weightlessness on the development of eggs, for example, are only little known.
Through the effects on geoes, it is possible to anticipate the effects of pressure change on humans in a similar state for longer periods, according to New States in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death of the gees and the cause or cause of death are resolved.
According to Interfax’s news agency, “sex” passengers were frozen.

France arrested terrorist suspects at Nice airport
France arrested a suspect at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to be a recruitor of a Syrian jihadist group.
The French authorities informed this on Sunday.
The officials came to trace the man after the 16-year-old girl had attracted money to leave Syria.
She had to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe that the girl was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul but warned the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unknown about her daughter's intentions, and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
The man is from Czech Republic, but now he lives in France.
The French authorities had already followed the man’s actions.
In France, the authorities have been worried that the radicalised youth in Iraq or Syria’s wars also constitutes a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that about 800 French citizens or books in France travelled to Syria during the recent conflict, returned from there or planned to leave to Syria.
Koponen: We have good chances to win
The team's desires to continue to play when Finland will meet today in its second match of the World Cup in Ukraine.
If the opening stage for the United States had been expected, Ukraine would again be part of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary gains.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have good opportunities to win, Peter Koponen predicted.
Ukraine hit the matches on Saturday in the first match of the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team is trained by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, in charge of Ukraine playing aggressive basketball.
Ukraine’s key player is the leader of Eugene “Pooh” Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the world champion of a hundred meters after three years.
Jeter cast 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter is a quick departure, but yes, we've been played against these before and we have to get our standard defense in good condition, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday’s loss for the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that on the field we can see a normal crash, Möttölä said.
The alleged Hollywood star incubation spreads online - a part assured to be real
On the Internet, a number of naked pictures that are alleged to present well-known public persons.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has become a victim of a "naught campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence representatives, which would seem to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a terrible violation of privacy.
Officers have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged, representatives are threatening.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the pictures she spread about are real.
He had taken these pictures with his husband years ago.
When I know that these pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I just can imagine what harsh trouble was seen for this.
I feel compassion for all who have been victims of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice says that the pictures that come on their own name are misleading.
True or false naked pictures are also moving from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunstist, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka painter criticized his own saying, “They don’t do enough to get out of here.”
FC Honka is currently at the last position in the Liga.
Painted by Walter Viitala comments on Sunday after the VPS match describe the mixed current situation of the follow-up.
I haven't had a paint coach for four months.
But everything needs to be adapted,” said Viitala after the 1-2-look ended.
Honka made a lot of defence errors in the match, especially in the first half.
It wasn't a bad idea for the defence game.
Player traffic has been in Hong Kong this summer, and for this reason also the defenders in front of Viitala have changed closely to the will.
With the gambling brake, many young players have also gained opportunities that they may not necessarily deserve.
"But part does not work enough to get out of here sometimes," referenced without nominating any individual player.
Hongan chief coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat the same with the Vital.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to train and play to have fun and you think you're a whiskey player, and you don't have to work, then you're probably in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I have given a lot of youth game time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players cannot expect immediate success when the players are constantly changing.
During this period, I haven’t had the same composition twice in a consecutive time.
Especially in the defence field, the rabbit has changed.
This is the biggest reason why we are in this place,” Kuqi said.
After the loss of the VPS, the hook is a serial juicer, secondly in balance with the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left, so there is still time to avoid falling into the One.
I've never hit the team, and I'm not going to hit it now.
“We won’t really get rid of this series,” he said.

In the 1990s, he conducted the Kingdom series.

Ice Bucket’s Challenge to Leaving In Investment
Britt Isabelle Roberts shouted so hard when cold water was thrown on her that she damaged her face's bone.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully.
The woman was treated when she was worried by Ice Bucket’s challenge as she was so strong that her leakage went out of her placement.
Isabelle Roberts cried so hard when cold water was thrown on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I only shouted, but when I shouted, I felt my leukas began to melt," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is thrown to the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts, a moment before an accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my lung was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to thank the first tree.
A 20-year-old British who took part in the super-recommended challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where the leak was placed back to his place.
The video key has become an Internet sensation, and it has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View angle of the wolf (also): How can the increase in fan number explain?
Today, it was a great archive.
This was what the footballer Sakari Pehkone said in 1995, when Finland played in the EM final tournament against France at the Athens Marouss Football Hall.
Not too soft.
I remember the game when I was there.
There were also about a hundred Finnish who shouted to draw 20,000 viewers, otherwise empty-handed bullets.
What would Pehkonen say 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukrainian Championship?
In Bilbao, a hundred Finnish fans are eighty times.
The 1995 EM championship was a Finnish basketball search time.
The men enraged their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian race at the Helsinki Sportsfield.
This victory would open the doors to the European Cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann joined Möttölä in the final tournament.
A solution that many disagreed.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far wise, even though everything wasn't done according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team crashed deeply.
In the battles of Athens, the Finnish were known to be a bit more than one hundred.
Among them were journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown incomprehensiblely.
Nobody knows exactly how to tell me about the Finnish turtles.
The estimates have moved between 7,500-10,000.
Whatever number between that is, it's totally inconceivable.
Here’s an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global economy, companies are crossing borders.
In the sport there is still a chance to see how we are going internationally.
With increasing mobility, we can visit seeing how our girls and our sons will succeed in the world,” says Professor Hannu Itkonen in Physical Sociology.
Of course, both in Spain and in the Flightball Championships in Poland are Finnish who want to live.
Common experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
In the sport itself, there must be a lot of attraction.
Weep raises the sport to the popular culture.
It is a lower threshold to go to sports halls than to see art in Berlin.
Without success, the mass can’t move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, chief coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to get to the top sports professionally.
Nearly ten years ago.
Then the direction changed, and the team's activities were lifted to the foot.
The Air Force made the same movement a little earlier.
They both enjoy the fruit of the work.
As itkonen says, both types have succeeded in producing their top sports, with sacred trinity functioning: sports-media sponsors.
That is why the audience is also interested.
And the media has learned what such a carnival support is, it reminds me.
Could the balloon species transfer this massive interest to the home series?
On average, the racing and air ball is played for hundreds or a bit more than a thousand viewers.
Weeps should consider the question good, and not necessarily give the answer that would promise very good species.
The second school believes interest is moving.
The other one is the one who doesn’t want to have a sweet soil.
This bubble is ready to live for the World Cups, but in their basic thinking, the series are not double-interested.
It's a challenge for followers in the middle of the curve.
Bottax tont assurance - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola is awarded by the formula carrier Valtteri Bottax's beach quote.
The municipal government agreed on a 1.4 hectares tonne delivery on Monday.
Tont will rise in the future.
The success of Bottax has been followed in Nastola since this mapping time.
He is tried to be an ambassador to market Lahtea, Lahde District and Nastola.
Gift cottage is located in Koiskala, Kärkjärven Beach.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate store.
In the area there are seven buildings in decomposition, from which the municipality will be decomposed at the expense of six by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved its fourth Belgian competition for Formula 1 this year.
He's five at the World Cup.
Bottas is an original Nastolian and lived in her childhood at Villahte.
He lives today in England but goes to Nastola whenever he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited high school and youth rooms.
Design-intelligent clothes come - but hardly for the poor
It is currently presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open Tennis Camp in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart spot testers are the field balls, but also the amateur Marcus Giron, who belongs to the top of university players, holds that.
He says that the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The silver sensors of the nylon have been drawn from which the information is transmitted to the bucket in the bucket and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart heart rates, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
The central unit is removed before the washing machine is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told the exact time for the start of the sale of the tape, nor have it even suggested its price, Tech Times reports.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that contributes to smart clothes.
Californian Athos has brought smart and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart, breathing and muscle work.
Clothing costs $100 per piece, and the size of the central unit for them is $2100.
It was also written by Red Orbit.
Fixed way to save in lessons
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 per student, so Matt Schroeder will soon start his second year of study to invent a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system in which later years of course students borrow their books against a namely compensation instead of selling books on the same path.
“My mathematician book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the whole semestre and a bump of ointment,” says Schroeder, a 19-year-old student at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his book in the last quarter would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the Board of Directors of the University, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on curriculum and educational supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent lessons, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay it clearly less than the book that students purchase.
According to Neebo Inc., more than 250 campus bookstore stores, leasing books has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books of universities’ books were rental books in the spring, Neebo company president Trevor Meyer reported.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online stores
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay in the campus’s book store.
The recommendation price of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostet's ninth printing book "Calculus" is almost $290, but the book from Chegg.com is available at the price of $239.99.
Buy Used
Used books are a good option if the reader does not disturb other notes and has spent the appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used in Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University’s last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” using Amazon.com online store for only $42.
Without a new book, it would have cost $48.
Massachusetts’s Amherst’s College Without Walls School director Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if they can use previous pressures on the course.
Sometimes new pressure reforms are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old pressure can only be found in the fracture part of the price, which should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon library stores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular shopping site for used books.
Rental
You should consider hiring lessons if you care about them well, remember to return them and don’t need them when you’re on the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the whole semester will cost about $20.
Explore the rules of the rental company, such as notes, use of the accent and spending on the following payments.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Acquiring e-books instead of ordinary papers can also become a question.
Sometimes these books are rented by paying for the right to access an e-book to its owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store receives the e-book "Calculus" for about $61 for six months.
According to Bracey, many students in literature save the most, because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
Compare different sellers is worth whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29-year-old, who soon begins in Pepperdin's Legal Affairs, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price, as it can ensure that he is looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learns this through his car.
The delivery of the book he bought was left for four weeks, and he finally had to acquire the book at the full price of the university's book store.
Tampere Legion Theatre is 20 years old
Theatre founded in 1994 opposes unemployment, exclusions and passivity.
They are welcome to everyone who wants to perform the art.
Organize expressive entertainment activities for unemployed people aged 17-35 years of age.
The proposals often take a position on society.
In recent years there has been a depressive topic for Depression Moderata, Remember! - humorous stories about narcissism as well as classical recommendations.
They believe that every person can change his own life.
The number of people died in firefighters nearly twice as much as last year.
The number of people died nearly twice this year compared to last year.
According to Spek, 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
Last year, at the same time, the palm olive oil was 31.
Most of the dead, 36, were men.
People over 65 years of age were 11.
According to the firearms report, the situation was worse in 2009, when by the end of August 64 people died in fires.
Most of the firefighters occur in the apartments.
There are 17 fireplaces, 21 houses, and seven small houses.
Spek reminds me of the fire safety of my home.
At least the functioning of all home firearms should be ensured, according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial accumulation tools are easy to use.
There must also be an impeccable departure route from all home premises.
Children should also tell what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered from Newport’s city centre on a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the Cardiff City Hall at the so-called summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events for the weekend and talked to demonstrators who had arrived from Belgium.
Young people were rescued from Australia’s Blue Mountains
KAKIS teenagers were raised safely after they stayed at night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went to Govetts Leap to Blackheath after midnight on Sunday.
The parents were worried about the young people who hadn’t come home and called the police at 8:00 p.m.
The local police and drivers' search party was sent to search for young people, and the two were found at about 23 p.m. near Bridal Veil.
The girl had broken her knees, and the man fell down and hit his head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were lifted up on Monday morning.
The victims were taken with ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrawn from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were given a resignation order.
According to Ukraine, calculators have steadily taken together with Russian tanks on the field.
According to the Army representative, the counterparty’s load has been so accurate that it is likely that there are Russian professional soldiers as a shooter.
Over the past few days, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the south-eastern sea of Ukraine, the Ukrainian party's party ship was risen in the morning, the border guard said.
Eight of the Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard wasn't sure where they were shot from.
Separators have already stated on social media that they have started.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov, however, demanded that Ukrainian troops should be immediately attracted to positions from which they cannot shoot civilians.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the negotiations of Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and Ethiopia, there should be immediate fires without conditions.
Lavrov also recalled that Russia will respond to the newest possible economic packages.
First, we are coming to protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the action of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Rankings received from Malm and Copenhagen
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the harsh whales dropped Southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floods would break several roads, mix the traffic and bury the cars alone.
The authorities estimate on Sunday that the flood can take a long time, although it was predicted that the rain would stop on Monday.
The rain could be surprised by the Swedish authorities, and not the weather warning in advance.
Ari Mustala, a member of the Finnish Air Science Institute, estimates that the rainfall was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder if it was difficult to predict.
French socialists should “be quiet and help France,” Francois Hollande said.
Valls called on the deeply distributed left to "exhibit his feelings" towards the socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of a new government was not approved by the majority of French.
The President deserves respect for all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our task is to stay with him," Valls said and earned aplodies.
As a quiet living, the Prime Minister urged the government to leave a quiet 35-hour work week in France, despite the debated new economic minister Emmanuel Macron earlier this week, a debate on a revival proposal that the rule should be deprived.
On Saturday, Hollande asked socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, issued disagreement with the meeting of Socialist representatives who expressed different opinions and criticizing the Socialist Party that it would allow France to abandon hope for the future.
Marine Le Pen, head of the ultra-right national government, rejected the ongoing disagreement between socialists and said Valls would not believe the new government would last a few months.
Francois Hollande may have left the war, but also Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous wasn't late for even the summer.
"No new government will last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal for the distribution of the representation and assured his party's election victory in early elections and he himself would be willing to lead the party.
The French-governmental party suffered a rash loss in the municipalities in March, and the extreme right had a list of majors in the EU elections in May.
According to the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party may be divided into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Post-university political researcher Pascal Perrineau warned that French will soon lose their patience unless the new socialist government manages to improve the economy and high record unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the audience must quickly notice that the change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get worse.
Pokka fraudulently fraudulently fraudulently fraudulently fraudulently fraudulently in the part of the program, the Finnish producer Kirsi Alm-Siiran, Nina Rahkola and meteor Pekka Pouda.
The Hunting Finland program released on its Facebook page last Thursday about fun video tracking on Thursday.
In the video, writers Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to smuggle the Finnish advertising show on the next day, but the smuggle does not go into the tube.
Alm-Siira is confused in his words when he tries to say the word to his budget, and his mixture also gets Pouda and Rahkola to lose his pocket once after once.
And these heroes should be allowed to draw direct broadcasts even tomorrow, the Facebook update in Finland says.
The video has become very popular on Facebook, and it is both loved and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, was the third in a series of portraits in 1972.
This is the Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
At Fredrikinka Street in Helsinki, the House of Construction Majors was held at the Socialist International Meeting in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the shower, seven guards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we got a lot of time to photograph five minutes.
I took this picture within five meters.
The light and the background were at the point.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir's viewpoint shows that the leaders of the Middle East have had difficulty in the past.
In the competition, you will be able to get the pictures of the famous people or events taken.
It’s wonderful that you can succeed with other images now, as long as there is an idea and a visual rotation.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best picture of Lasse Virén from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Argument: Aarnio study has already paid over 5 million euros
The investigation of the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already paid over 5 million euros and required 30-50 employees.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed his work on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
The limits suggest that the control of the lawfulness of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining the information systems of investigation and justice.
Modern technology allows for the reuse of criminal materials.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where information collected to detect the crime is automatically filled with electronic proof chain, while enabling comprehensive legal control.
The claim is reviewed on Saturday.
Over: The 1999 concept of vegetable food forgot the school wall: "Fish and canoe foods belonging to the fish diet"
The picture of the special newspaper on the wall of the Women's School of Purchase has caused food on social media, says Yle on its website.
Plant foodstuff!
Vegetable diet includes fish and cannaves at the school breakfast.
Only when the list has meat, we prepare a vegetable option!
This is the case in the forgotten wall of the school, in the 15-year-old newspaper.
You can see the picture from here.
The social media picture has led people to send a remarkable feedback to the municipality of Pirkalka.
The chef of the Food and Cleaning Service, Arja Vaarma, says that the forgotten sheet on the wall is not correct and it should have been removed a long time ago.
Obviously, before my arrival, there was sometimes such an idea that was discussed with healthcare.
Each student receives a meal according to his desires, he notes to Yl.
Today, at Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetable food option only with parental permission and a physician or health care nurse certificate of the vegetable diet.
Fortunately, the decision will be justified by the fact that young plant food tests may leave a lack of nutrition and the lack of meat or chickens may be surprised by the parents of students.
Norwegian Cruise near $3 billion Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the third largest crossing company in the world, negotiates to buy its competitor for $3 billion by Prestige Cruises International Inc.
With the sale of Norwegian Cruise, a market value of $6.8 billion, it will enable Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruises and rich customers to continue its competition against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on the possible agreement may be published already this week, however, it is also possible that negotiations will not result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private capital investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be made public because negotiations were not made public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruises and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comment requests and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise company has 13 cross-country companies covering the route map of North America, the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13% from 2012 to 2013, with its turnover amounting to $2.57 billion.
The Prestige Cruises, which operates from Miami, is located on the Oceania and Regent brand names, including a total of eight cross-border units, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than last year.
The $29 billion cross-season industry is expected to benefit from the rise of economies in the mid-classs of China and India in the coming years.
Companies are competing to get these new customers one option when choosing a crossroads.
Prestige Cruises registers its first shares in the U.S. market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares after trading in 2007, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its combined Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion to Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise enrolled as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting’s share of the company was 28 percent, Apollo’s 20% and TPG Capital LP’s share of the private investment company was 8 percent by the end of June.

The city government of Tampere is dealing with this today.
Animalia hopes to support the strong initiative from urban governance.
According to the Director of Animalia, the University of Tampere’s Arbitration preparing the Hall of Tuomiva, during the delfinaries in Finland and around the world, it is worthwhile to end quickly.
Fortunately, over the past few years, there has been a widespread view around the world that the roof of advanced nipples like delfines in the delfinaries is not animal protection or ethically sustainable.
I would like to take this view to Tampere as well.
The ceasefire of the Delfinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination.
According to the judgement, the death of Nesi-delfine confirms the requirements of the sub-period of the delfinary activity.
So death is a sad follow-up to the history of the narrow delfinary of the Sarkcenieme.
It’s time to put a deadly point, close the delphine prison, and start to find out how Tampere’s delphine can be transferred to a limited sea area, to some kind of delphine safeguards, the danger of judgment requires.
This could not experience a return to the original life environment of the delphine, but hopefully the rest of the delphine living in the Radius could experience more life than the unpleasant concrete, the Danger of Judgment hope.
The aim of the Animal Protection Association is to prohibit the use of all wildlife species in the circular circles in the overall reform of the animal protection law.
There are also delfinaries.
In support of the request, the Executive Director of Animalia will participate in the Declaration on behalf of the Delphine, which will be held today.
The protest at the Embassy of Japan in Helsinki will take a stand against the delphine hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting period, approximately 2,300 delfins are brutally captured or killed every year, either for the use of delfinaries or for food.
Putin calls for Kiev to open new state negotiations with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday urged the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations between the "state property" region, Russian news sources say.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that separatists would rule from the territory of Eastern Ukraine to become part of Russia, but that it would need to re-examine its role within Ukraine in order to give the population of the Russian language authority to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin’s demand for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal partners is responsible for his obvious negotiations strategy, which he has followed until the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists to dominate the region and forcing the position of the Ukrainian government, thus making it possible to assert its position in practice.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to regain the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region of which the separatists were dominated by the joined Moscow on March 18, the Ukrainian Crimea.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novorossia", "New Russia" - this term resembles the days of the revolution of the Russian Revolution.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace negotiations are "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians are carrying out campaigns for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces are attacking civilians in regions governed by separatists.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical aspects, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state of Southeast Ukraine, taking into account the interests of people living there," he said.
Putin’s reference to “state ownership” is associated with a broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the leadership of Kiev, trying to deny the fears of the Russian-language regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov said.
This cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal conflict of Ukraine."
The Interim Representative of the Kremlin, aimed at correcting Putin's "false interpretation", stressed that the Russian government treats the rebellion of the separatists of the eastern regions in a way different from the Crimea, whereby it, in practice, encompassed a region with a majority of the 2 million population of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would be considerably more difficult to connect even Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the region's 6.5 million people are not ethnicly Russians and because, according to conflict-precedented opinions, most of the population supported remaining in Ukraine.
The independence of which Russian diplomats have discussed at international forums would give local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would in practice give the Kremlin power in terms of the territory that connects Russia with the Crimea.
On the Black Sea land, which was attached to Russia five months ago, the Russian Navy and commercial maritime port areas and historical coastal dimensions are located.
The region between Rostov and Crimea also has minerals, factories and metal coatings that produce vital products for the Russian Army.
In his official speech on 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko proposed that lawmakers of Ukraine – after new elections – consider constitutional amendments in order to increase the decision-making power of regions that differ from the core territory of Ukraine from their own economy and to their own languages.
However, his vision of his independence appears to be strongly different from the view of the armed and afflicted separatists of the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin filed his latest demand for the government of Kiev to negotiate with Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced further last week in the invasion of Russian tanks and troops in Eastern Ukraine from a peaceful region on the coast of Azov.
Ukraine’s security authorities are afraid that the adoption of Russian-supported separatists in the city of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a greater effort to overcome the entire strategically important coastal region to Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military personnel to establish the city of Mariupol, which is known as a port city producing steel from half a million inhabitants, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke in Brussels on Saturday asking the leaders of the European Union for further actions to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon reach a point from which there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not make decisions on direct action; the leaders introduced additional sanctions to enable them to be implemented if the Ukrainian crisis is rediscovered under unclear circumstances.
Ukraine's soldiers had to attract their position in the territory of Ilovask, two Russian banking army and 1,000 troops moved to the territory of Donetsk last week to strengthen the difficult separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers on the island of Ilovask in Russia were exchanged to 10 Russian counterparts, arrested on the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
The opening country in Milan was made by the Japanese tournament Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute.
The second half first hit Sulley Muntari and Jeremy Menez a little later.
Lazio also won the end of the game, but Diego Lopez fought Antonio Candreva's shooting.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
The San Siro stadium was just on its side at the training debut at the former Inzag in Milan's attacker's stadium.
A total of 39,000 viewers were announced.
Australian publications and Gabi Grecko in the nude scanning circle
Geoffrey Edelsten has stated that he was stolen by the hackers perhaps by his stuck and Hollywood A-star Gabi Grec's naked pictures.
In the entertainment world, a group of Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures have been published on the internet as a result of a widespread fame crash scandal.
Hacker has been claimed to own a total of 60 naked stars of the Hunter Star in Lawrences as well as other superstars, such as the top model of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingn, the singer of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as actor Kirsten Dunsti.
The pictures of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovskin and Melbourne have also been stolen during the iCloud year.
The list has 101 famous names.
Last month, the Greeks who had been excited by the former said to the Confidential newspaper, "This is imaginable."
All personal contacts and pictures should be kept private.
It is ashamed that private information can be stolen and distributed.
The Greek case in New York City is reported in the online magazine, saying the victims "feel ashamed".
Hackers are believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of Palmer's samples on the upper edge of the pool.
Palmer's films include "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series stars Strahovski and Sucker Punch actors Browning have not commented on hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence's representative told the TMZ that "there is a terrible violation of privacy."
Attorney Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker on Twitter: “The publication of stolen images does not differ from the sale of the stolen product in any way.”
The publication of stolen images should not make it possible, just from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like at home and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fans.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red, but Finnish blue.
According to STT, Finland’s win was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish singers.
It seemed to have played at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game, Finnish Captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland had already lost 0-2 in the match, but won 3-2.
In the fourth section, Finland made the miracle six points backwards.
Cuba already led a 16-10, but afterwards the Finns got a hurricane.
However, the parsata Finnish fan was disappointed when on an field, the charter machine was unable to land due to the hard suck of Katowice.
The fans who ended in Warsaw were late.
The Finnish balloon fans have conquered Europe in the last few days.
In the Spanish World Cup in Bilbao, there are more than 8,000 fans.
Just as every Finnish basket would have been the winner of the match, U.S. star player Stephen Curry invited Finnish basket fans after the match on Saturday.
