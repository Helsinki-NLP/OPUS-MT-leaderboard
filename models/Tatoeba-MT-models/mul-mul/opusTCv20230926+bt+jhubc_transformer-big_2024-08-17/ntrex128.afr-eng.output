The members of the Wallis Assembly are worried that they will look "soothing"
There is conspiracy among some meeting members on the proposal that they should change their title from AMs to MWPs (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the meeting to the Wallic Parliament.
Members of all over the political spectrum are afraid that it can blow a spottery.
A member of the Working Party says his group is concerned because "it with Twp and Pwp space."
For readers outside Wallis: In Wallies, twp means stupid and pwp means discharge.
A Board member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Wallic Conservative Party says his group is "inacceptable" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of suck or stupid.
In this context, the Wallish letter w is like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you pronounce.
The Assembly committee, which currently proposes legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called the Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Wallis Government Act 2017 gave the Walliese Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received extensive support to appoint the meeting a Wallic Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Welsh Parliament Commission chose members or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in consultation with the public.
The AMs are apparently busy to propose alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus may be a headache for President Elin Jones, who must submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the working mode of the meeting, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the drafting of the committee system.
The AMs will get the last saying in the question of what they should be called when they discuss the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name must be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to eliminate decades of conflict with neighbouring Greece, which itself was a province called Macedonia, out of the way.
Athens has for a long time argued that its neighbor's name in the north represented a claim in its area and has repeatedly made caption against its application for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the people's vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's watches are silent because churches in Harlem suckle
"Histories were spoken, said the old men I spoke with, there was a crew and a church in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"No one of these two is there anymore."
He said that the disappearance of Croatia is understandable.
"People socialize today in different ways," he said.
"Croatia is no longer the neighborhoods where people don't go regularly."
As for churches, he is worried that the money from stock sales will not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the types of people who will not help the rest of the neighborhood's refugee system.
"The overwhelming majority of those who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will be the day that these churches completely close even closer, because most of those who enter into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white municipalities before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist community turned back in the 1930s.
A black community that worshiped nearby took over the title of the building.
St. Martin's was overseen by a black community led by Early John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from retailers in125st street, a main street for purchases in Harlem, who didn't want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the charion "the poor people's watches."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something different: "a cultural cat" and "a remote historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's hasn't replaced him.
What the last few months at St Martin's play is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some introduced by the body leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Archbishop.
The church council, the church’s governing body, which consists of leathers, wrote to the Bishop in July with fear that the Bishop "will try to carry the cost" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the Bishop.
Some members complain about a lack of transparency on the side of the Bishop.
Hawaii injured 13-year-old in California
A Haai attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured him when he hit the first day of the cruise season in California, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7h near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was busy with friends for a half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying to help and then grew closer with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first curve prison, but then he realized "that he cried, "I've been bullied!
I'm dead!"
Her entire key bone was open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
"I cried out that everyone should come out of the water, 'There is a hail in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy fled to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known what the attack is responsible for.
Life rescue captain Larry Giles said at a media intelligence session that a hague was noted in the area a few weeks ago, but there was a certainty that it wasn't a dangerous hague speculation.
Giles added that the victim had caused traumatic infections to the upper part of his body.
Officers have closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's say Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are fighting with department store-type beauty walks that are staffed by a specialist assistant.
As part of a large expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while selling fashion and homeware back, the larger beauty trends in 11 stores around the country will be tested and if it is a success next year to more stores.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill racks that are used for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury says it will double the size of its available beauty products to up to 3,000 products, which will include for the first time trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its Boutique grinding series so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that attracts more and more younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test perfume dealer concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and the second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet purchases and a move to smaller quantities of food that are purchased daily at local shops means supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury, said that the stores will look more like department stores when the supermarket chain attempts to fight with more services and non-food products against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsburys have placed Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since they both bought these chains two years ago, which, according to their herbalware sales, has strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsburys tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ends to an argument about how the profits from the pharmacies in its stores should be divided.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's 281 store pharmacy business sold for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, three years ago.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering a wide range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty processes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be helpful to provide advice.
Our series of trade names is designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now a territorial beauty destination that challenges the old way of purchases."
"Peter Jones" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones ran out of 'wave' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrawed her from a £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothing and future trade name, Truly, no.
The couple's business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The 37-year-old This Morning provider announced on Instagram that her hair was pulled out.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last moment - to focus on her own reus contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "wrong" when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a tensioned meeting in her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunity - which was up to £1.5 million - means she can't give enough time to their home-and future trade, Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fort.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones climbed on a radiator and exchanged Britain for one of her holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at a distance.
It would be her long-term future that she would wear over the next few decades.
Her decision to take her away has completely fooled all those involved.
No one could believe what was going to happen on Tuesday, it was so close to the show.
There is a house full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that are right to be sold."
Knowledge believes that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that make the most money flow, can hunt millions out of the bag due to ice investment in products that range from cuts and candlesticks to clothing and housewear, and the possibility that its announcement can affect even more delays.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a three-year-old mother, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been following Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple holds a holiday together and Jones owns a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an I'm a Celebrity ITV provider.
A source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words "and then fall in love with us"
He sought criticism of what he was getting from the news media because he made a comment that some would be considered "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give it so much?
Trump said in his House "Newsleevers vote."
"I didn't give anything."
In a second meeting after Trump, Kim described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a big step after North Korea's nuclear weaponry.
But negotiations on nuclear weapons have been burned.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership conference in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "other-consensual response" of the U.S.'s early North Korean disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure full.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic part in his meeting.
"We're going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on the way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have provided positive results - it has ended fire tests, helped to free immigrants and causing the remains of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this tribal arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing just there," Trump said while showing to the crowd right in front of him.
Getygolf and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, hundreds of deaths
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign neurological organizations have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been rooted, no national disaster is announced, a prerequisite to catalyze international aid.
"In many cases, they were unfortunately very clear that they didn't ask for international assistance, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is busy gathering a team to travel to Palu, it's not sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokeswoman of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid attempt.
Given the earthquake that continues to endure Indonesia, the country remains terribly weakly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami collisions are built in Aceh, it is not a general face of other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning syrene in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although it was a warning of power.
This is the best challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's flooded infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and spent costly money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko's administration is drawn up by funding shortages as he will take the re-election next year in the face.
Mr. Joko also stands for the pressure of emerging sectoral tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands of themes such as Christian and Muslim legs with cattle, pillars and bows, and other primitive weapons on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scored a good resemblance against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He hit the ball to the left before he hit the target ball far away.
The attempt was high over the window as it was wearing to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball jumped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in the case.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and hit once and didn't think too much about it and just shot."
Chelsea was half-time 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper played Mateo Kovacic again in that playground with a mirror head before he hit the middle field and hit in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic received and received in the middle field quickly.
With a beautiful front screw, he put Hazard into the window.
Hazard passed the defense and with a left-foot scale passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farest target network.
Liverpool will take place Wednesday at 3 nm the fight against Naples at the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will be attending 3 nm in London in the UEFA Europa League for Videoton.
Detaly increases to 832 Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people have been arrested under the robbery of buildings that hit the earthquake on Friday at a size of 7.5 and caused burners of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was occupied with the puin of indoor buildings.
Police arrested man, 32 years old, suspected of murder after a woman's death
A murder investigation was sent from stack after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.

The police encouraged people in the area to come forward that they had heard or seen anything.
Speaking inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early stage but I am calling on anyone who was in the circle of John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything missing, to contact us.
I also refer to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that can be necessary for us."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe that they know the woman came up at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued as the police said they were in the process of enlightening the victim's neighbours.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but has been reported by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was unpredictable when he found out what had happened.
It is now said that it will take hours before they are released again.
A police officer said to a man that the whole area is now treated as a crime.

Anyone with information is asked to switch @MerPolCC DM, 101 or switch Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's status of Cromwell is recently met with 'rewritten history'-twiss
His rejection will be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "soothing" and "a attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the deletion of statutes that Oliver Cromwell's statues would be a subject outside the Westminster Palace.
The imagery of the British Civil War was still executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's minority illustration of Cromwell is proven by the 19th-century opinion and part of the history writing of a figure that many people believe is still worthy of memory.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is being treated by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate illustration, it is the subject of continuing historical debate.
The fact is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognized figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murdervark Several Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwestern China.
The man, only identified by his "Yuan", was found with a dismissed blood-covered killer near a hook at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post Sunday reported.
A pig farmer is prepared on May 30, 2005 to spray pigs in a pig farmhouse in Xining of Qinghai province, China.
He traveled with his nephew from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, her nephew found him dead and found a door open to a neighbouring pig.
He said there was a big pig in a hook with blood on his back.
A Forensic investigation confirmed that the 550 pounds of pig killed the farmer.
"My nephew's legs were bleeding and disgusting," said the nephew, called "you," said the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 vm to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A brand manager told the Evening New that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and brand authorities negotiated after claiming a compensation for his death.
Although strange, there are cases of pigs that people have previously reported attacks.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their place in Massachusetts and left the man with critical infections.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pounds of pounds a Wally farmer crashed against his tractor until his wife crashed the animal.
After a farmer of Oregon was frightened by his pigs in 2012, a farmer of Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "speak."
"They're just playing.
They're very curios... they're not trying to make your seed.
You just need to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res from Hurricane Rosa brings widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rose, however, will bring floods across northern Mexico and Southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.u., a category 1 orkan, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trail over the Pacific begins to take shape and move eastwards to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will be severe tropical humidity northwards in the southwest of the U.S. starting to award.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture in response to the upcoming trigger over the coming days will bring severe rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous kits floods, waste flows and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will cause place-place rainfall numbers from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Kits floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It will be extremely unreasonable to walk into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain may cause deep desert rivers to touch and dark storms to bring permanent local winds and dust clouds.
The next trip will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall rates of more than half inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth fishing.
This will be the first rainfall of the season.
Some distributed tropical rainbows will leave Arizona to start Sunday and early Monday to get more widespread before the rain runs Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October may see intense temperature temperatures across the U.S. as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropes remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the warmth of the summer will again increase and expand.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern U.S. October will start warmly, with widespread 80s from the Southern Layer Plates to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of high temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday the attacking testimony of the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christiane Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political death point continued, with broadcasts that regularly interrupted programs for Friday's up-to-the-nippert'ie injury: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to the FBI to conduct a long investigation for a week.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee that her 100 percent is sure that Kavanaugh beat her in drinking and tried to pull out her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartfelt testimony, said he was 100 percent confident that it did not occur.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people have looked after it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company has counted an average watch figure on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Syfers were not immediately available to other networks that it showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to meet people looking at the office.
To put it in perspective, this is a audience as large as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion host Kavanaugh's appointment strongly supported, had all the networks previously interviewed with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day long, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was always high after the hearing.
Flake was the main figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where warriors shouted at him when he tried to take a hyser to a Legal Committee.
He stopped a few minutes with his eyes down while CNN was living in a picture of how he was slaughtered.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?"
It was said to him, "You can do so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and went to the door of the house, saying he would have to say more at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all live hours later when the Justice Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do this with the intelligence that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was in front of the hand that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump filed an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May criticized her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political player" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times officer.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May on September 29, 2018 at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview along with her on the newspaper's front page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued with her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said a proposal that Britain and the EU should have to make each other's rates "fully ridiculous" in advance.
Wayde Sims shooter: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the emergency shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Amptenare released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the strike.
The police found the glasses back on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS-associated WAFB reported.
After they interrogated Simpson, the police said he admitted that he killed Wayde.
Her borrower was set at $3500,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge Parish's legal lighting office issued a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gun injury on the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's predecessor task, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and Territorial Citizens for their assistance with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Alleva thanked the area law application for his "free and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-ses predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
Her average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 backstages per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball player Will Wade told the team in "slaughter" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about," said Wayde.
The volcano is in a hurry to Mexico City
As a result of the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital reached.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after acquisition of activity in the crater and recorded over 24 hours 183 releases of gas and as a product.
The center has multiple drainages and shootings monitors.
Images on social media showed how thin low gas motor windscreens cover near Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geofisici has noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which has been 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a earthquake with a size of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police bots with Catalan separatist for celebration of independence votes
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-one-independence travellers with unusual police orders, and thousands joined protests to remember Catalonia's first polarising vote for dismissal.
A group of masked pro-separatists who have been kept back by unwilling police, flocked them with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually wear from tourists.
A storytelling also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their bullets to keep the baking.
For several hours, pro-on-dependence groups sing on a tone "Not forgotten, no excuse" in confrontation with the Unionist's shouting of "Lank Life Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for low injuries occurred in the injury, the local press reported.
The tension is still high in the region of independence, one year after the 1 October referendum by Madrid is considered illegal, but is celebrated by separatist-Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent but the participation was low, with those against dismissal that largely boiled the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police in violent attacks attempted to prevent the vote line from continuing across the region.
Pro-ona-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent an appeal in support of the national police.
The accusation continued, but was forced to take another road.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist visit with his wife, said he was no longer hoping for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"We spent one of the best moments last year.
I've seen my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but naked victory in the last December elections, Catalan pro-on-dependence parties shook this year to retain momentum, with many of their most famous leaders, either in self-determined balling, or in detention for their role in the organizing independence of the referendum and subsequent statement.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the allegation to support the police on his phone, said the conflict was added by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-controversy since last year, announced that he will attend European elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to deny the retreat in democratic values and the oppression we saw from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men are arrested after a car in front of the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, are arrested after a car has repeatedly crashed against a house in Londonderry.

Speaking inspector Bob Blemmings said the building itself was damaged.
A cruise bow may also be shot at a stage of the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston to secure victory
Advanced Livigston hindered Rangers to place Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as the driver of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was to prove the difference when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed in the Premiership this season without a walk and came to stand next week in front of the predecessors Heart, which are their eight points.
Rangers is first hosted on Thursday for Rapid Vienna in the European League.
In the meantime, Livingston expands their invincible lobby in the division to six matches, with headquarters Holt who has still not tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston's chances against bot visitors
Holt's team had to run for a long time before they signed a goal, with their round burningness that brought Rangers all kinds of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but turned in front of the target corner, then AL could play widely just after he approached and met CH's headquarters above the target corner.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with deadly moments.
Thus, the decisive goal was reached.
Rangers dropped a frozen head and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who together gave Menga the opportunity to scrape and sign a goal from the middle of the window.
At that stage, Rangers ruled possession but couldn't drive through the home defense and target guard Liam Kelly was largely unpleasant.
That pattern has continued in the second half by Alfredo Morelos a turnover of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated by Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow widely labeled to escape Livingston's open game.
Crossing has repeatedly reached Livingston's frame and repeatedly reversed, while two penalties – after Halkett's deputy Glenn Middleton's challenge – were removed.
“Fenomenal” by Livingston – research
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont by the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal games and performances for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations of this rising job.
Their gambling style and manship are almost unchanged since their return to first-range, but a lot of honour Holt has come to the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was enormous with his minor defense ranking while Menga for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall usually held on their tons.
Rangers have been inspired.
As much as they did at the time under Gerrard, they couldn't keep those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could walk through the home span, which is somewhat a week's team for Rangers, which they are in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was Saturday (29 September) smiling and blue air when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO members.
They have had an outbreak on issues that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then allowed Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police said security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering before the mosques but many supporters came up closely to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan visitors – many of their Kurdish – also made their votes thick and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The controversial allegations reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as a hero and explored by others as an outcratic.
Deptford-Pad Accident: Bicycler dies in a motor crash
A bicycler died in an attack in London with a car involved.
The raid was located around 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedici was present but the man died on the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
Metropolitan police said officials were working to identify the man and confess his neighbours.
Shuttles and bus drives are in place and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six guards were injured
Six guards were injured in a high-security jail, the prison office said.
On Sunday, BST broke out around 09:30 and is still running at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist-- "Tornado guards" has been called to deal with the rebellion, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to a wings.
The guards are treated on the stage for low facial obstruction.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been developed to pay attention to a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
His employees are treated for damage.
We don't do violence in our trunks and it makes it clear that those who are responsible will be referred to the police and can remain behind trails longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the head of the prison was received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, unwilling officers were invited to pay attention to serious disturbances during which staff with balloons were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfloede (Drink areas Trek Dalk Benefit)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure in Arizona hits but that's exactly what can happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves over the southwestern desert and brings kits flood risks.
The National Value Service has already issued shields for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and late on Monday will come closer with rain.
The National Value Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "twenty tropical cyclone since 1950 retained tropical estorm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inch rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inch in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated total of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside of the kit flood risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is stirred by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest currently experienced drying condition.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona experienced at least extreme droughts, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa leads the road to approaching land around the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still against Hurricane Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes colder water in the Pacific tea and therefore reduces its power.
It is expected to reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and contains a significant flood risk.
"Total rainfall from 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then, as a tropical storm, move north over Mexico before this Tuesday early morning, reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression and then move through Arizona and to southern Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger expected by Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening kits floods and puinstreams in the deserts and land shifts in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
A 20-year-old man was imprisoned after a 16-year-old man was found in Somerset.
The occupied teenager son is found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were detained at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers have appealed to anyone who may have any phone images from what happened to progress.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "gotten under the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for the right Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered under the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified and denied Christine Blasey Ford's assertion that he had sexed her decades ago when they were teens.
Ford also witnessed her claim during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliant and quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most skilled legal spirits of our time," a jury with a clear record of public service," he said.
The president directly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican emergence in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing," he said.
That's why I'm looking for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resistance and obstacle."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held not later than Friday, a senior GOP leader said to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shooting, zoenami, with increasing numbers
At least 384 people have died and many have escaped when huge waves on beaches broke when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a feast on the beach when burners of up to six meters (18 feet) high in sunset broke at the beach, many after their death dropped away and destroyed everything on the road.
The zoenami resulted in a 7.5-dimensional earthquake.
"When the zoenami triggerment emerged yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB, said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The zoenami didn't come on its own, it hit cars, dumbs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the zoenami moved across the sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to jump the zoenami free and survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and stores that have been destroyed, bubbles that are confused and have an inner place and a mosque that is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the town was still injured.
A series of earthquakes is felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Assessment and Application Technology Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's success cult was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell on Hirosjima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the point of a long, narrow bay, could aggravate the size of the tsoenami, they said.
Nugroho has described the injury as "important" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have an entry place.
Some of the victims were found where they were trapped under the puin of buildings that were inhabited, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and injuries could be bigger along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake.
Communication "is totally obstructed with no information," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and added that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not report that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In amateur images shared on social media, you can hear how a man on the top floor of a building desperate warnings about the upcoming zoenami shouted to the people under the street.
Within a minute, a wall of water hits the beach and swallows the buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't explain the image immediately.
The shooting and tsunami caused large power failures that cut communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send freight aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still needed food and other basic needs.
The city's airports are only reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit the cleaning centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsoenami death rates have increased over 800.
This is very hard.
Although World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where employees in deck shelters were trained in their office courtyard, they passed on the way by tons of destruction, Doseba said.
They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very hard.
Even while aid groups start with the important task of launching the catastrophe relief task, some people have complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience are prevented to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, stocks and staff from overseas can start only after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we can set it up for international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the application of the second night on Palu to Friday's earthquake and tsunami are friends and family of those who are still missing, hopefully that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the tragic storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a riol pipe.
Sunday, a woman who was rescued for two days was trapped with her mother's appearance along her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National False Swift Swift, has completed two of the missing False Swift Swifts for the Asian Games that ran earlier in the month of Indonesia.
Another of those who returned to the Roa Roa Hotel, Mrs. Mandagi included, was his students.
"As a senior in the field of falsehood, I've got my own emotional load," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells us how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed on social media under the Falskermsweef community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festivals.
His messages, however, were just answered with a gray note, instead of two blue note.
"I don't think it means that the messages aren't delivered," he said.
Thief steel $26 750 during refill of OTM by Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning at a Brink's employee who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Taxi.
The car's driver was about to empty an OTM in a entertainment complex and prepare to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man came down behind the Brink's worker and stole the bag money to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects flying from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name after Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The object previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for a long time used the byname Ye and used the byname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that had cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the program's manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is a shortening of its current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe you" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you"," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with a radio provider Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm you, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a more reflective of who we are."
He is one of a number of renowned rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known among other things as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preferred name for Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also come to an end with or without a connector and hoofletters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised initiating the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody compensation against students to never use military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to confess the Mexican people."
Military date shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people died in a time when left-wing student movements posted across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities attract youth to bands.
The U.S. has to double KI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made KI announcements, even shortly the U.S. is an overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced last year their plan: they want to be No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the KI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next break in KI," Lee said.
The duplication of funding can double the chances that the next major KI performance will be achieved in the United States, Lee said in a weekly interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent KI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a KI system that robbed the highest-ranking American Othello player and later became a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next will be one, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government chairs, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate law," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed influential people from other universities to work on KI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S. KI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in KI," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations share money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at entering partners from the industry and the academic world and the Withuis announced the formation of a Committee on Artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in KI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aiming at creating a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been fired months later.
Macedonians vote in election or change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," acting that would resolve a decade-west dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which had a province called Macedonia, has filled their northern neighbourhood's name representing a demand in the area and rejected their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign doubted whether the rise would meet the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum referendum read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price that could be paid to chase permission for Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies like the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union's samples, because this means life safer for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians said they would accept the result of the vote to decide it.
This change will require a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
The state's election committee said there were no reports of accidents at 1 nm.
However, the rise was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko vote for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name that will work the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
For the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small elevation and pulled chairs to tents set up by those going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us to be like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring many necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A recording published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another recording, carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote.
For the referendum to be successful, the vote must be 50% plus a vote.
A resignation in the referendum will be the first serious resignation for a pro-western government's policy since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigation through the entire Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton defense from the way in Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it ridiculously easy to appear during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a set of targets at the beginning of the series.
He chased by three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed by a defender before hiding several others on the edge of the Brighton target hook.
He then sneaked his face to the left, where he found for Sterling.
The English predecessor used his first touch in the hole to send the ball back to Aguero, which used his right foot to hit Brighton target guard Mathew Ryan with a snap to the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces problems with his feet," City Manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are pleased that he had a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League fighting.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area at that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the farest target corner.
The Sky Blues' predictor just shot the ball in just before he was over the back line.
City takes Hoffenheim in Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 nm. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
With the nationals out of the game, there isn't much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to launch the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still outplaying complications for the Rockies, which has a game-progress above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least won a promotional place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday, but still wants to draw their first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowds and the other team will probably play at the highest level from any point I'm going to be in the face of this year.
Why don't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their beginner on Sunday, but it is a good report to let Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, had a throw-out session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-on Saturday.
The Washington lawyer is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 exhales in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds meetings in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his High Court election Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we did was on the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big – I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing, and that’s why I’m standing everywhere for these candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "A man sees this agile, agile radical group of Democrats, a man sees this happening now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by using any possible way, a man sees the community, the geniality.
"They don't give to anyone who they seek, on whom they should walk to get power and control, it is what they want, power and power, we don't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "refuge and obstacle."
"And a man sees it over the last four days," he said, and the Democrats called it "wrong and common and genial and false."
He referred to the name to Dianne Feinstein, the Senate's High Court Committee, who received harsh orders from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
You're leaving the document out?
Uh, uh, what?
“No, uh no, I’m waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I’ve ever seen.”
The labour party is no longer a wide church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under sensation, it wasn't just a surprise.
I am the last person in a string of Workers Party LPs for whom it was said we were not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has received similar treatments because she has unprecedentedly risen against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the mood of sensation criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy has differentiated from previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting said Friday that "we want the meetings should be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers Party LP, that was exactly what was Friday's AR meetings.
Unfortunately, it is not today the tone of many meetings and the promise of "more friendly, more favorable" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views within the Workers Party are not patient and any opinions are judged based on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I thought I had shared similar political outlook before, expected from my beginning to make a U-road and take positions that I would never agree otherwise – regardless of national security or the EU single market.
While I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I’m saying – there’s a thorn of sketches on social media that demand that I don’t be re-elected, denial of politics from the core and to say to me that I don’t have to be in the Workers Party.
This is not just my experience.
I'm really happier than my colleagues because the comments that are focused on me tend to be police.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who every day strike a flood of sexist or racist offenses in the face, but never crush away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of deception have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with any "musical of infidelity" or change of selection arrangements the party becomes stronger.
I have had a lot of advice for the last two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so expressed and then I'm going to be "okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government’s negligence that literally denied my state-run school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – despite being a local council member or government minister.
I've never hid my politics, including in the last election.
Nobody in Nottingham East could ever be confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who took place on Friday, I can just say that with the country shipping on a Brexit that hurts all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to shake time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the message I actually had is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, or it's now their members of the Working Party: I'm proud of serving you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or will stop my political benefit from doing what I believe in the best of all of you.

Sections 38 - 17: The Unknown
Two late three may have drawn the final result slightly, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserves to beat in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now on the top of the pound, the only invincible team of the ten.
At the end of the age it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, which had the home span and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and we're still unwinned, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Once to Ayr, they have taken their chances better than what we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, fucked by Frazier Climo, made Ayr before, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, which was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot signed an unfaithful three.
Climo has increased Ayr's prominence with a criminal head, just before him, just before resting, fucked a solo three to make this resting 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's three, fucked by Baggot, reduced the backdrop to five points.
There was a long retention for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott, which was deleted on a portable, and from the beginning Ayr grew up the front with a Stafford McDowall three, fucked by Climo.
Ayr's observer Captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card and then Melrose used the extra player with an unforgettable three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The homespan made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed Climo without the ball, and from the streets, MacPherson pressed the ball behind the upcoming Ayr lounge.
Climo fucked it, as he also almost did from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's target and sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth of the house.
Still Game star seems to take a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems like Still Game star is moving to the hospitality industry after discovering that he has been appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays along with old comedy show Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nine season will be the last of the program, and it seems like Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun screamed that wanted to involve Kiernan at Glasgow's "flowing restaurant industry."
'The sea is our s'n': Bolivia's surrounding country hopes to reopen the Pacific court
The Navy patrols a mass-covered fleet office in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Navy bases from Titicaca More to the Amasone are covered with the fighting shout: "The sea is to our right.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the land surrounding Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile is still fresh – as a result of the need to rescue the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is probably the highest that it has been in decades, while Bolivia waits for a judgment by the International Court on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and is obviously expecting the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH judgment on large screens around the country, in the hope that the court in Den Haag will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to provide Bolivia with a sovereign transition to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president – which is a controversial fight for reelection in the face of next year – also depends on many of the Monday's pronouncement.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he said in August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia will decide for the benefit – and that will change less if it would.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to recognize Chilean territory, and has argued that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's pronouncement comes to the last appeal only six months shows that the case was "not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's case, it may have delayed over the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was captured by the current Bolivia administration," Zárate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric took the only remaining Chilean approval, she told him.
Bolivia and Chile will face talks again at a stage, but it will be very difficult to carry out close talks.
The two countries were replaced by ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in Den Haag, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extremely quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and a chance to end "to 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the maritime issue as a political cruck.
Bolivia will never open its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not come unless its U.S. can trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country will never first disarma their nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri was on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a meeting in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is obviously on the edge to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream image" that continues sanctions and U.S. caption to a statement that would also bring North to its knees after the Korean War ended.
Washington is cautious to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking significant steps to disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about taking away from an arsenal that the country is considered the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump debate.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of big main covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn the sun away, you don't have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of laws over-growing main covers at their SS19 collection on the loophole that emphasized the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Excessively unpracticed care has passed through Instagram this summer and these designers have paraded their confusing creations on the loophole.
The outbreak by Valentino was an over-sized beige hat with a firearm wide edge that enclosed the model's heads.
Other over-growing accessories included water trays decorated with jewelry, a toenail and even a potato – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One creature looked like squad equipment, with a snorkel and dark glasses, while another looked like a mixed roomyshot.
If you're looking forward to the great fashion, it's your happy day.
Stylish viewers predict that the enormous guard may be on the way to the shops near you.
The overwhelming guard follows shortly on the hacks of 'La Bomba', the strokehead with a two-foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpracticed shoes spread across social, sent another great creation over the loop – a stroke-strand task that was almost as large as the swivel-drawn model that weared it.
The burned orange raffiasak, made with raffiafrains and made a white leather handle at the top, released at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hoods and beach bags appear in stores for the next summer – as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the application for over-growing additional ones."
John Edward: Language skills necessary for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a rite of academic excellence performance, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examinations, which has only been reinforced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 scholars across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their scholars and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world language continues as a popular and desirable course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in your own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only rely on English when we want to build relationships and confidence with people from other countries.
From the recent U.S. exams of this year, we can see that languages are above the liga table with the highest success figures in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages has a higher degree A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students had a higher degree A in Mandaryns, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young adults in the future.
Languages now, as a scholar, have the same regard as the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculum and elsewhere.
A recording by the United Kingdom Commission for Professionals and Careers in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons why employees are struggling to fill jobs are attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
With more likely jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future with such a lifelong abilities.
To communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically be placed above the competition.
According to a YouGov recording of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent couldn't speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and was the only language spoken by a double number percentage, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in today's children's language education.
To know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped with a better chance of getting meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will vary in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught as essential for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandaryns or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teacher staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equipped with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future involves.
It can't be seen at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still very important to the future of the country, and therefore it should be reflected in education.
Actually, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will launch Sunday for San Diego Lakers
The wait is almost over for fans to see how LeBron James makes his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers-afriger Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday's predecessor opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he's going to play, he's going to be determined.
"This will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell said James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an early week's exercise, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six matches in the predecessor program.
"I don't need to get ready at this stage in my career," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Congress Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a flag election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump's first of five scattered relationships next week, including stop at friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote that is currently being held for his choice to fill the stakes in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming inter-election because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over Congress when it is voted in November.
How long is Trump's engagement in West Virginia tonight and how to look at a man online afterwards?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, has been scheduled for 7 nm. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can look below through live flow to Trump's merger in West Virginia.
Trump will likely pay attention to this week's hearings to the nominated Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been stressed by allegations of sexual disability with an expected confirmation held up to a week while setting up the FBI investigation.
But the main point of this excessive relationship is to help the Republicans who are faced with difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign said that these five connections were aimed at visiting volunteers and supporters next week, while Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Government over the Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's match, which was arranged for the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind the stamp.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a hire at the votebus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have the courage to fight to keep hope alive when they enter Sunday's single game
After three single sessions, Saturday afternoon four games were possibly just what this Rider Cup needed.
The swinging slider of momentum is a totally conceived sporting concept but one in which players absolutely believe, and definitely in competitions like that.
Where would they say that the momentum is now?
"They ran with six points and now it's four, so we wear it as a little momentum," I counted," Jordan Spieth said when he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points before and twelve more to be played.
However, the Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have such a little wind in their seats and that there are many to encourage them, not at least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the clean field and led by his example.
The shoe celebration crew became harder as his rounds progressed and he thought a critical sethou to win match four totally equally while he and Thomas were two rounds with two backwards.
Her set of games that won the match at 15 for them was greeted with a similar screaming, the kind that a man says he believes that the American team has another chance.
"You really need to get everything out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that the players are listening to.
18 puppies to print their stamps.
The only players who have more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's poor but nice couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only few who didn't sign one about job number on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one about job number on Saturday morning as well as during the next nine Friday morning.
The lobby, and the way their energy appears to flow to and from this exploding crowd, confirms that they are the players that need to be crushed on Sunday, and there will be no willing player like Fleetwood or Molinari who can delight a potential European victory when the sun is about Le Golf National bag.
Optionally both at the same time or at different puppies.
It's too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short meals with Sergio Garcia, the four-morrow hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One hold over the number of jobs and two doubles on the front nine let the Spanish and Sweden land in a hole from which they couldn't even come.
There is no one to help you out of your hole on Sunday.
The four balls and four games are so exciting to keep closer due to the interaction between the couples, the advice they give them, the advice they don't give them, and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
To date, Europe has always played better as a team and has taken significantly on the last day, but this four-play session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the struggle that party, especially at home, doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 for the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy benefit on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they have come with a 10-6 prize from Saturday's four-and-quarter matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victorys over a shocking Tiger Woods to take their counts so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who attempted to keep the trophies they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, ruled an American team that was disproportionate in the morning's four balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. has gained more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they don't let the backwards crash.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newer who won four points in a race while he and Molinari, called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, is just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup that signed four points after their first four matches.
Following Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played excellently together to overcome a papa Woods and American newborn Bryson Dechambreau with even a more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who ran himself on Saturday through two matches, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four games and seven in a race.
Justin Rose, who was silent during the morning's four balls, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are the first and third on the world list.
However, Europe has not always had their senses on a pleasant day with a windshie southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth won a huge tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the brand for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They signed a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to crash Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after losing the first two puppies.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has recovered a backstand of four points when they enter the single game, although Furyk's team has just to play equally to keep the trophy because they already love it.
After they were the second best for two days, however, it doesn't seem to have a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will not "unselfishly" disarmad without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continued to aggravate their uncertainty from the United States and that the country will certainly not unite its nuclear weapons without such properties.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had "significant welfare measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test area and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unite our first disarmament."
While known North Korean complaints reiterated Washington's resistance to a "fascist" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons, North Korea will be rewarded if it takes step-by-step steps, its words seemed meaningful because it did not unilateral removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally rejected in Pjong's
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first top discussion between a US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 when Kim took to work to "destroy nuclear weapons on the Korean skiing island" while Trump promised North Korean security.
North Korea wants to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang should first open its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted demands of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by burning the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a forceful way, and even dismiss against the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of people who are unknown about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are worse than our unfaithfulness."
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second top discussion between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader earlier in the week gave attention to the United Nations.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue was about the destruction of nuclear weapons from South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of nuclear weapons would not have done so in the Korean shipping point."
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was irreversible that North Korea's firearms would be directed to the U.S. country mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump called Kim a "firearms" on a suicide bomber.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea "fully," Kim exaggerated for his courage for taking steps to disarma, but he said that a lot of work needs to be done and that sanctions must remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for it, saying, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council that "the application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue jealous and without ceasing until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unified sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to deploy funding for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in the outskirts of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second top debate.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress has been made, but North Korea accused him just hours later that he had put "beautiful demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break a missile and also hit a nuclear complex as the United States "consistent measures."
He said Kim told him that the "compliant measures" he wants to see are the security security that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalization of relationships with Washington.
Harvard students take a course of enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all its graduate students to get more sleep in an attempt to study the growing macho culture by working on coffee plants full-night sessions.
A academic found that students at the world's top university are often unnecessary when it comes to the basic principles of how to look at themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he offered a speech about the effect of sleeping intake on learning.
"At the end of this, one girl came to me and said, 'Why do you tell me this first in my senior year?'
She said no one told her how important she was to sleep - what surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to enter the course after it was found that students were seriously sleepless during the week.
The long-term course includes a few interactive tasks.
In a department there is a picture of a sleeping room, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise clothes and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency and the importance of a sleep gyrotine.
In another department, participants are told how long-term detention risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer can increase.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then courageous participants to think of their daily routine.
"We don't know that students' behavior will change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the health effect is to choose to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in studying the whole night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeping is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student should be a 'secret weapon' to avoid stress, exaggeration and anxiety, he said - even to avoid it to put weight on, because sleep intake puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he went to Harvard last year, one of his classrooms.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to conduct him for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all evening students to complete a similar study program before they join the institution where people fight with each other.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting up an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb your circade rhythms and to do so, you can lead to sucking.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal wins Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sartion of a day-to-day breakdown when Dolly Menga's target cap Steven Gerrard's unholy team took care of a 1-0 layer.
The Ibrox spa wanted to win their first as visitors since February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave Gerrard its second down in 18 matches as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which took place in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga allowed seven minutes to rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers span would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers now fall into sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target difference.
And there may be further difficulties for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object seemed to have been thrown out of the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that passed by Ayr after the end of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and would have been in his noppies with the way his well-trained team shot their opponents at each turn.
Rangers may have dominated ballbests, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
In fact, they had to sign after only two minutes point when Menga's first deployment Scott Pittman passed to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened his great chance.
A deep frozen by Keaghan Jacobs later found Captain Craig Halkett but his defence companion Alan Lithgow could just miss a scout at the back of the target.
Rangers overcome control, but it seemed that there was more hope than belief about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to get a penalty at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless ordered, but dispute judge Steven Thomson rejected Colombian's requests.
Rangers made it right to get only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was swallowed by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a mark target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening at the 34th minute might be against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it, although it's just for their hard work.
Rangers haven't seen a deep piece of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cooling head and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he broke Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and had almost immediate effect when the wings sent to Morelos but hunted the impressive Kelly from his string to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett who had long balls after long ball palm.
Holt's team could increase their progress in the last stages, but McGregor got up well to get Jacobs back before Lithgow could get out of the corner.
Rangers' deputy Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a criminal head when he hit Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanak: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TEL VERDER ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of tracking and measuring radio activity, an invention that ultimately led to the device called Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, such as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
"What is this on earth?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Speaker used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set these overflows, you can even hear the effect of the atoms that are transmitted by radio activity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, it's about it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer can teach the immune system to "see" rower cells
New cancer can teach the immune system to "see" and kill rower cells
Substance teaches the immune system to identify rower cells as part of treatment
The method includes the removal of immune cells from a patient, its change in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test test shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman who has been treated with anesthetic, who teaches the immune system to identify rover cells, has seen her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from a patient, its change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising substance."
HER2 "drivs the growth of various types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorate cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "learn" them how to attack cancer cells, worked to blow some sort of leukemia.
Kanye West started spotted after his performance on SNL with a pro-Trump, while behaving a MAGA head.
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was released in the athlete during a Saturday Night Live after an executive event in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would put him preferably in 2020.
After he singed his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he behaved a Make America Great, he exploded against the Democrats and reiterated his support from Trump.
"I talk so often to a Witness and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star spotted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's legal committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it's not outdated, West's image material has been loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock for West is trying to spot by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him behind the rise over what he had on his head.
"They put me in the back of the bowl.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They've made me boil!
And then they say I'm in a low place," the Washington Examiner said.
"West said, 'Will you see the lowest place?'" He said, "Will you wear his superman's garment because it means that you can't tell me what I should do. Would you like to move the world forward?
Try love."
Her comments were at least twice exploring the audience and members of the SNL roll distribution seemed to be distracted, Variety reported, with one person there who told the publication: "The whole athlete died."
West was introduced as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former clerk, Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by the head of the TPUSA conservation group, Candace Turner, who said: "To one of the most encouraging spirits: THANK YOU YOU WEERSTAND BEED TO THE SKARE."
But chat program wife Karen Hunter found that West was merely "who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen to reward someone NIE (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe accepts an ideology and announces that puts my community in danger.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the space cluster announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being that had been known earlier than Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who changed his name and followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who had previously been known as Prince.

The prosecutor will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-sword role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticized the stereotypes of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be treated to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic men in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married her co-worker from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31, also, admitted that he felt "really strong" to make this issue work.
"I feel quite strong at the moment - where did we go wrong with maleness?" he said.
"What did we learn when we grew up with the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television is very likely to be responsible for growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely male characters.
He said, "What was born and what was taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that make young boys feel that they must have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something seemed to be wrong with our young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones prosecutions and prosecutions when the series next summer comes to an end, because he says he's 'clair with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a rower.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so it gave me my future family, and my life from here," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married Leslie's family clothing in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The overwhelming majority of new cases is transmitted by sex, representing a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spreads through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people gaining HIV in this way has almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical matter in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to work on the case.
Maxine Waters denied that an employee late GOP senators' data, condemned "dangerous lies" and "co-responsive theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday issued claims that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawyer's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the allegations were conducted by "ultraregic" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even deceitful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the home address and telephone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual disobedience against the nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The game took place some time after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the locations is linked to Waters' office and made the information of a member of Waters' staff.
"This unreasonable claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened due to this fraudulent and false claim - was therefore not responsible for the removal of this information.
This unfair claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon criticized online, including former Withuis personal representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is a witness to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he must not be angry.
He wouldn't be challenging.
He did not question the motive of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who is accused by critics that he was apparently angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who attempts to highlight Waters in the mid-election of the kisses, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he said.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "has informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the defendants will be put to the guard," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spiespottery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit in any new film with a British entry and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English axiocoma spottery franchise - which then began with Johnny English in 2003 and further shocked with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will language-in-the-size self-sacrifice on the subject of how brilliant power we are willing to be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the unhelpful Johnny English with his pencils and rubber face had his license to put everything up for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English film hearings.
He is, of course, the missed secret agent who despite his bizarre claim to a slightly sophisticated elegance of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good sketch from that old man who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening of the London Olympics 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveller and international man of racials, leaving chaos behind him, which Atkinson played once in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest version of you.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval pantser vessel and the screwboard shortly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gifts for physical comedy are displayed but humor feels fairly flooded and uniquely overwhelmed, especially when the "serious" film trademarks like 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy itself with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it's focused on children rather than on adults, and for me Johnny English's teaspoon is not as original and focused as Atkinson's stylish clips in the person of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A Kuberkraker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the disturbance of the agent to the service - an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strike for a prime minister who is an inflamed and famous character, who already experienced a total collapse of political involuntary: Emma Thomspson does her best with this kwasi-Teresa May character but there are only few in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy has been threatened, she must call someone out of her resignation.
And that means the sucking Johnny English itself, now serving as a teacher at the one delicate institution, but giving out of the record lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are a few cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spying school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency task and is translated again by Ben Miller, with his former long-term companion Bough.
Bough is now a married man, married to a duckboat commander, a allmapstieks role in which too little is expected from Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of them to completely upset everything in Her Majesty's secret service are fully at the service and come to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is among the dangerous tattoos of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the real-life Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journeys from ridiculous skills: pretending that they're killing a French restaurant, causing their chaos when they smoke themselves on board Volta's luxury hunt; and English lets pure anergy break when he tries to use a piece of virtual reality to get acquainted with Volta's interior house.
For that last scene nothing is saved, but as cute and excited as it can be, the whole affairs are quite like children's TV.
Very medium.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't turn to think: Can the British don't give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes his talent really reach him right?
It's a plan for the British to work on a Friday for only five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to be paid for a Thursday work - but for five days.
The party wants to claim that corporate base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution must be transferred to workers by giving up their extra day.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day week - but they will still increase the same payment home.
Sources say that it will "pass" to the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in favor of the workers.
To change after a Thursday month was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior working party said to The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This won't happen at night, but a four-day work week is an ambition that applies to the party's approach to rebalance the economy for the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers Party will not be first one to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a Thursday week during her campaign for the general election in 2017.
However, the ambition is currently not signed by the entire working party.
"A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party."
Skadu Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to wipe out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from "unconditional directors" and "winners" to service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their entire investment as a Labour government can make "deductions" on the basis of alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in direct companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector companies to employees, which can get annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their opinions
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week and raised the question of whether any Republican senators can convince the findings of the office to withdraw their support.
In an interview released on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything that could make them change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more acceptable than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and the accusation came out, and said, "Did you do that?
He was surely strong, undefiled."
Graham's voice seems to be unchanged.
"I formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would require a charge of dynamics," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Brett has jealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"Everybody who calls it couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the World Burger Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the host of the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equal impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Feast is now in its seventh year and during the feast, tens of thousands of people will flow to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy not only acts by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the opportunity for the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Burger Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Army Project, an international speech group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the opportunity (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concert travellers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to create them consciousness.
But just how successful was the 12-year-old World Burger who remained to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "cliquity" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twitter?
Since 2011, Worldburger says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a crowd of different goals.
It says that these actions helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that would potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements that proceeded from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based company of investors and implementers committed to "aid children to reach their full potential", and promise to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end disnutrition in the country after they have gained more than 4,700 twists from the world.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman said in April 2018 during a London concert.
The group also said, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional stimuli.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that asks "what makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
"This will be a long and hard way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-participation movements for us, we will be successful, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the artists who will perform at this year's occasion in New York, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. fleet can be used for "blocking" to turn Russian energy exports - Minister of Home Affairs
"If necessary," Washington can leave him on his fleet to repeat that Russian energy lands on the market, including in the Middle East, revealed U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it works on the invitation of the legal government - is an intention to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe," he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and ways to handle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seas are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke endorsed the participants of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profits that regard themselves as the "vote of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches to handling Russia and Iran and noted that it is practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, less or more, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "one talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a lease to replace Russia, far away the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unpaid" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin reasons that Washington's firearm opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy can't be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view has uncovered Germany's reaction, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) called on the U.S. to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "reflect" it as president in 2020, Massachusetts said.
Massachusetts' Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "regard it" to stand as president after the mid-term elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider this to stand.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set up our stubborn government and it includes a woman at the highest sport," she said.
"After November 6 I'm going to seriously consider this to be president."
Warren said her opinion on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he "has taken the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very expressed in her Trump's criticism and Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
In a twitter Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation for our vote."
A recording released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should be in 2020.
Eight and fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts elections said that the senator would not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe recording.
Two-and-three percent supported the idea that she should be standing.
The recording showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should be, with 38 percent who support the idea that he should be potentially standing and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to be possible in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin to PTSV by Donald Trump Congress
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested on Monday and accused of an accident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he is going through since his return, I have felt sympathy with other families that feel the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers return," she told a audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the departure" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hanged, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their co-soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence, attacking a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of firearms while he was under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Taxi.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District Columbia support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims flying from band or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the court government order Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and release the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policies has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and her violent band members," she abused her, but US officials refused her asylum on July 20.
She was in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, described as nations that deepen problems with bands and domestic violence in the face.
The new U.S. asylum policy in 2014 reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals which allowed immigrants without the necessary documents flying from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia Attorney-General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the state, federal and international laws of the decades."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be determined to be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the demand, and such lawyers know that policy," the friend-van-die-hof government order said.
Attorneys further argued in the law order that the policies that immigrants refuse access would harm the U.S. economy and said it was more likely that they would become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary work."
Attorney-General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration law firms in June to no longer allow asylum to victims flying due to domestic and band violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their country as a result of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to relieve all problems – not even all serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu while deaths doubled in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly slight.
"It feels very stressed," 35-year-old mama Risa Kusuma said while she was sitting at a devastated city in Palu, a crushing center.
"Every minute brings an ambulance.
The water is scarce."
Inhabitants have been seen where they return to their devastated homes, searching for door-to-door possessions, trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-scale shooting, are overwhelming.
Of the occupied, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's hostility hospital where patients are treated outside due to continuous severe nausea.
Trane fills his eyes as he tells about the violent earthquake that offered the fifth-storey hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"It wasn't time to save ourselves.
I'm printed in the walls, I think," Haris told Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a marriage.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but I was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of 'refusing' with 'propaganda ad'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertising in a U.S. newspaper awarding the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador to China Beijing accused of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China’s Daily paid entry in the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s state newspaper mostly sold – after he accused China of taking part in the U.S. Congress Elections of November 6, a complaint that denied China.
Trump's accusation of trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, noted U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently captured in an escalating trade war leading to the fact that they made tariffs equal to each other's imports.
China's wages early in the trade war were aimed at slaughtering exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had sold US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a Sunday's Des Moines Register opinions, "it now aggravates slavery by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government caught America's chosen tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, a man at the newspaper box in the street here in Beijing will find very limited deviating voices and not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have made about the disturbing economic trail of China, stated that the media is under the strong inch of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has denied the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans reject women's elections with Kavanaugh debakel, warning investigators
While many top republicans at the Hooggeregshof nominated Brett Kavanaugh are standing and defending him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, investigators have warned that they will see reactions during the upcoming elections, especially women.
The emotions about this are very high, and most Republicans are recorded that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor in political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School for The Hill said in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s appeal for an FBI investigation on the nippers would be enough to strike angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, D.C. official.
On Friday morning, protesters "November is on the way!" drown while protesting at the Senate's entrance portal while the Republicans who have chosen to control the Legal Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic, has filed.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political investigator, told the news agency.
"People say that's already high; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among swais-female voters in the predecessor and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even in the case of Ford's public testimony that the details of her allegation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court mentioned, investigators said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue to confirm.
"This has become a confusion for the GOP," Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the vote of the committee or the final vote and if Kavanaugh is placed in court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities of the U.S., a group helping elect Democrats, to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more than the latter's side.
A new recording from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe or probably Ford's testimony, while 35 say they believe or probably for Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh probably or definitively hit during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to Flake's appeal, the FBI currently investigates the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford swore to the Senate's Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh ordered her at the age of 17 while drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Hooggeregshof-nominated her gender portions were displaced while attending a party during their students' years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world's web plans to start a new internet to announce the struggle between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world's web, invites a start-up business that tries to deal with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech-leader's youngest project, Inrupt, is a company that develops on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee pointed out that the idea with Inrupt is "world rule."
"We have to do it now," he said about the project.
"This is a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
This may include contact lists, deals, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and in one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is entirely dependent on the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the release of a total change, either, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential vote in the debate on network neutrality.
Even while Inrupt lodges, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm greatly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual celebration
The only spiritual Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during the First World War has been honored in his home village 100 years later.
Lt.kol honored Bernard Vann gained the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sharp shooter and never knew he had gained the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbols" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's awarded performance.
According to the London Gazette, from September 29, 1918, his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin led "through many dish missing and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later crashed him to the fire line and led the line forward with the "largest courage" before he only claimed a field weapon and disabled three of the department.
Lit.kol Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German striker – just more than a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said her grandfather's action is "something I know I can never do, but something that is annoying."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also went to the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Jeungrkes.
Michael Vann said he "feeled to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a crowd of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206 but get Peppa Pig
Imagine yourself, you'll stay awake all night to watch the followed Bellator 206, just to not watch the main event.
San Jose's program contains 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on the way to declare each other the battle, watchers in the UK were allowed to be stupid when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were impressed after they were awake in the early hours, especially for the battle.
One supporter on Twitter described the transition to the child image as "one sick joke."
"This is the government's rule that the content was not suitable at 6 nm and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Marketing and Communications Bellator, said when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to join future UK viewers.
"I think when I think of the remission, I think we probably can do something," Coker said.
"But this is six hours in the morning on Sunday there and we will not be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were many SMSs that were sent around and again, and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six – as we do normally – and we have tried to offer more to our fans and just passed over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "minder" about sexuality
Olympic poet Tom Daley says he has grown up with a sense of minority about his sexuality – but it has given him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school before he realized that "not everyone like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had lured his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that to become a parent, he was less concerned about winning at the Olympics.
The regular provider of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, took off a few months due to the disease.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "minder" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of less than, and otherwise feel, the real things that gave me the power and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would disappoint no one when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal fan became a high-profile LGBT kidnapper and used its appearance in this year's State Poland game in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has lucky his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “has caught him on his side.”
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but says the age difference was never a matter before.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar height and low points.
The couple became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says her "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last goods he asked if they had already had tickets for London in 2012 – because he wanted to be in front of him.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be in front of him," he said.
"I stopped his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed about for a long time of my life – to get to my homes at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musician – Proud by Heather Small – who also resonated with him in building after the Olympics and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and leave on Saturday's Rider Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder tournament, but he will have to rectify his shape to repeat it's an unfortunate mylpaal.
Mickelson, who plays for a record- 12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball game and four numbers.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he was already often for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day to be racial and work on the top of his game work in the hope of correcting that screw.
Even at the top of his career, he never was the direct driver, and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long ruvel is always punishment of the persistent hold.
And as if the job on its own isn't challenging enough, Mickelson arrives Sunday in his ninth match against the exact British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with newborn Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are behind four points, start the 12 single games well, Mickelson's game may be absolutely essential.
Furic expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He has fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knife on his back and his arm placed around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes Hall and he has contributed so much to these teams this week.
I probably didn't think he would play two games.
I have put more in perspective, but that's how things worked and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, like anybody else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the player who played most of the Ryder Cup games.
It can be the end of a Ryderbeker race race that never really matched the heights of its individual performance.
Mickelson had 18 congestions, 20 congestions and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his presence had contributed to the team unfair aspects.
"He's a snake, he's sarcasm, he's got, he loves to screw the crazy, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaking with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows a big deal can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage for the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dean made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point priority, but only won a navel crab with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2
"A man continues to remember himself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the naked crop," Bjorn said, on the photo, after he looked at how the National Class of 2018 was for Friday.
So, the story will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
You're going full-speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I’m still telling you, I’m focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we’re also well aware of who’s on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added: "I'm never going to move forward with this.
Morre is a horse of a different color.
Morre is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a gholf player.
This is the message you need to transfer to players, put the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also put the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will want his players to be more individually travelling than they did as players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk himself had already changed on both sides of that great last day, where he was part of the wish effort at Brookline before he was lost as he finished when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain in 1999, spoke his players courage on the way to that last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but a man wants to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins in one direction, it puts a lot of tension on that middle game.
We have set up our team and shared with the men we felt, you know, will bring something magic to us tomorrow."
Thomas has gained the task of trying to lead the counterattack and come in the main game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I have chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it until the end," Bjorn said about his single game choices.
Germany's new warship is re-established
The German army's latest fregat would have been put in service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to error systems and growing costs, local media reported.
The invasion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the splinter new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fregatte, has now been issued to the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit-Korant, which has received a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the fleet in 2014, but the arguing post-delivery issues struck this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that ordered the fleet in 2007 will replace the revival Bremen-class fregatte.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a striking order of air weapons and anti-navy missiles as well as various secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest fregates for up to two years away from tuishawans.
But ongoing delays means that the advanced warships – which obviously will allow Germany to project power overseas – will already be outdated at the time they are in their service, says The Zeit.
Last year, the F125 was stored when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel in service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipship in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a ship builder.
Few are known about the reasons for the return, but German media have stated that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is implemented in a campaign.
Sagteware defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 navals – only half of the mantra fregated on an older Bremen class.
It also came to light that the ship is drasticly overweight, which reduces the work direction and reduces the fleet's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are probably twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also affected a question.
This obviously reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that hit the new fregates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany's fleet is engaged in crashing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet's "boots that can be deployed are busy to touch."
The officer said the issue has worsened over time, because old ships have been put out of service, but no replacement vessels are provided.
He decided that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
The National Trust listens to the Secret Life of Mummy
New research is conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aimed at revealing how multimouse uses the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will throw new light on the behaviour of the unique flying sugars and help lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprandavvergler mouse as well as the brown long-court and Daubenton-vergler mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important places on the property to track multi-music activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also make mobile recordings using manual guides.
Expert clan-channels of all recordings will check the frequency of the multimouse voices and determine which species do.
A Habitat Card and Report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat for the multimouse are the most important and how it is used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as forest creation and how to best manage forests for multimouse and other associated species.
Multi-music populations in Scotland and around the UK have declined significantly over the last centuries.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and vice versa may also contain a risk, as well as flyer and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as home cat attacks.
Multimusics aren't really blind.
However, due to their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a sophisticated egg orientation technique to show goggs and obstacles on their flight routes.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, is very serious over multimusics.
This is ten trained experts who regularly perform recordings and sleep inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated multimush reserve at Threave landscapes in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland's ten multimush species.
Farm manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal place for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for multimusics," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about multimouse that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to bloom."
He emphasizes the need for multimouse searching for maintenance in property because it is possible that unknown destruction of a single cramping area of up to 400 wifi and minors' deaths can mean and can destroy a whole local population.
Multiple mushrooms are protected and it is illegal to kill them, stir or prevent or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the audience to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our multimusics and for many of our species we don't know how to move their populations."
Ronaldo makes rape claims while prosecutors prepare to report German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape claims against him as "false news" and said that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
Her prosecutor is ready to publish a German newspaper, The Mirror, which has published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus predecessor is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 at a Las Vegas hotel.
He claimed to pay her $375,000 to stay quiet over the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he talked to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of all.
"I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's prosecutor is about to prepare to press Der Mirror over the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "unacceptable access to suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral compensation for any amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious injuries of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room after claims, where he raped her after an anal, according to documents submitted by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo after the alleged incident fell on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" left in the steak by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a skiing outside the court because her "sponsor was for revolt" and was worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the skiing because she is still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack to join from Manchester United at Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement to the Italian reuse, Juve.
Brexit: The UK will lose it 'for ever' as its car manufacturers
The UK will "beat it forever" if they lose their status as world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbed" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the case of a non-contract-Brexit, posts can eat.
The Burnaston plant – produced by Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – manufactured nearly 150,000 engines last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK motor manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, feared to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini investment in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what motor manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "net time" basis, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there may be deviation at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and tectose of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep up for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated prices to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success, but also to catch this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The markings of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful series of supply chains."
Toyota couldn't say how long production will be stopped, but he warned that added costs in the long term can reduce the establishment's competitiveness and eventually consume posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite Union's colleagues on board, says his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it will never come back again.
"We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be re-released, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Adjunct Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein can be "released with another week" while the baking board has been nominated for the high court Brett Kavanaugh, said Withuis Sunday.
Rosenstein keeps watch over the work of a special law advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election intervention, links between Trump aids and Russia and possible violations of law by the president.
Whether Trump is defeating the adjunct prosecutor-general, or not, and thus threatening Mueller's independence, he has been killing Washington's skin stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing an employer to take talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to Withuis, in the middle of reports that he was on his way to thank him.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "opt to" thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was issued to avoid a disruption with the Senate court hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual disbehavior, both testified, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump posted a weekly FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote.
Trump's Secretary-General Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date hasn't been fixed yet, it can be this week, I can see that it will be issued with all the other things going on with the High Court in another week.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will differ with that claim: Sanders hasn't held a Withuis personal information session since September 10th.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rareness of information sessions is not because of a contradiction to TV journalists who are "effective," although she said: "I'm not going to fight the fact that they're effective."
She admitted that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without getting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it a lot and you've seen it a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a personal information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the Withuis or participates in open sessions or press statements with visitors of dignity.
Solo-press statements are rare.
In New York's week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unrelated and over time, a strange appearance for journalists who were there.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fear
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff who have written in Scotland's NHS work to show the country's gratitude and express the desire to follow Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months' ears before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to cover the costs of treated status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the U.S. government has also stripped their preparations for a possible non-contract scenario.
I know this is for all of you a very worrying time.
That's why I want to repeat how much I contribute to each employee's contributions to the price, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services, and with which the patients and communities that serve us benefit.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery
Tennessee State Tigers' linear player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after taking a major defeat on Saturday 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Span Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee's head-in-law Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and some kind of injury there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/ size of the injury yet," and Tennessee is still trying to recover when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second academic year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
He killed him five times on Saturday before he left the game, bringing his total standing for the season to kill him at 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher sealing taxes when buying a real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher sealing tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the harbourless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to draw young voters
The seal tax will be charged on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the harborless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher sealing tax when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash used to help the harbourless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success attempt to draw young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to make high earners.
The sealing tax increase will be raised on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that the government's plans will help to counter harborlessness.
The extra tax – which is outside the current sealing tax, including the highest levels imposed two years ago on second houses and houses purchased to rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury is expected to bring up to £120 million a year.
A taxed 13 percent of newly built London property is purchased by non-UK citizens who raise the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the residential door.
Many well-known areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spoke villages” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in sealing tax to help more young people possess their first home.
He accused large building firms of holding their real estate prices high by raising ground, but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to retreat from quotas to affordable houses to restore Britain's "residence" disaster.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an ongoing series of housing improvements, including rental management and end of "no error executions".
He also wants to give greater power to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I'd like my prime minister to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means restoring our small home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it can't be right that it's just as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies to buy homes as for hard-working British residents.
Too many people, the dream of homeownership has touched a distant dream and the humiliation of harborlessness is too great reality."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's driver at a stage.
The 42-year-old Scots enjoy the challenge of blowing new life in the Northeast Span, which is currently in the third place in Liga One, three points among the tops.
He moved to the Stadium of Lig this summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I took the second team, but it was already," Ross told the BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But when I was a kid, I often looked at my father to Scotland at Hampden and that's something that pulled me away.
However, the opportunity can only come if I'm successful with the club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he wasn't worried about following such established names at such a large club, after he had previously shown Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's presentations.
"For the moment, success will be measured for me by: 'Can I leave this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"This isn't an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself as successful if I can find the club there again."
Ross's career in the management is only three years longer, after a period as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period at Hearts' staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Champions League in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playground at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This was probably a real crossroads," he said when he resumed how he took over Alloa's legacy.
"I really believed the government was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds strange, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence of it and experienced reasonable heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that one should come a week.
I always go through it in terms of stress and pressure of work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable thing I've been in my own skin throughout my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 nm. on Saturday, recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain's sucking Croatia's income, but it put more pressure on restaurants chains.
Drink spots and crew groups sold in July by 2.7% – but receipts in restaurants decreased by 4.8%, figures showed.
Peter Martin, a business advisory company CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Prerespected sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected meant that Julie was following a similar pattern as last month, June, when drinking places were at 2.8 per cent, outside that restaurants were even valued.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant shops in June has just worsened in July.
Drink-led drinking places and croupiers have done much better and rise more than the restaurants have fallen.
It's also the sun, but it's not as bad as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Within controlled Croatians and drinking sites, sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, with food washed down by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an RSM relaxation and hospitality analyst, said: "This results continue the tendency we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to shopping in the out-the-house-out-market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suck, although a drop in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly difficult and beyond continuous cost pressure.
The long warm summer couldn't come at a worse time for food-leading operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we have experienced will bring the necessary relief since August."
Total growth in sales around drinking sites and restaurants, including new sites that opened up, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trademark announcements.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents.
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – reveals a recording of secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents and teachers
The recording of 20,000 high school students reveals an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news raises fears that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head account" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret for adults.
A recording of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the Instagram photo shared page.
The news raises fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "head account" to show for parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who dropped her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who encouraged others to "power her".
The research, at the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of those admitting they had private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worried that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "vote for athletes" in Scotland Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle is elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the General Annual Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job-and-field leather and President Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect for Scots, the UK and the world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit very much from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm willing to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help to conduct the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games under his four golden Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC player, could not walk after he had a short-term ischimic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today I had a hit a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only the time will learn if I'm going to recover and to what extent.
This was an outstanding job, but it was completely restored, again learned how to walk and do talented exercises today!
"Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers with cows split opinions online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows milk.
To celebrate the release of what is called the "world's first quiet-portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a language-in-the-size music video-inspired advertising to show the freedom that gives the pump to mothers that melt.
Four right mothers dance in a squirrel full of strokes and cows on the coat of a song that includes lilies like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a stroke" and "If you haven't seen it, it's not breasts, it's my breasts."
"I pump it out, I pump it out, I pump it out, I pump it out, I pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement that was published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many who say it underscores the "gruwels" of the milk industry.
"It's a very weak decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"We need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days after they were born," he said.

One of them said: "They've got a baby and a mother's injury.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertising is so excited."
Others defended the advertisement, with a woman who admitted that the song was a "speaking" for her.
"I think you're a great idea.
I would have had one if I still had a baby.
To get out of milk, it made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little bit, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a good product," one wrote.
Another person noted: "This is a pleasant ad focused on mothers who melt (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cooked."
It's not an advertising that praises or judges the milk industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their brass.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who melt say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is deadly, does not have any wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a dietary bar that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies fast and even go out while they melt.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a large and outstanding presentation.
By drawing a parallel between women who melt and milk we wanted to put the melt process and all its challenges in the collar, while in a fun way people can find connection to demonstrate the wonderful sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump took the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the board for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of alleged migrant children has steadily risen although monthly border organs have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to wrong rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration, which makes it harder to put children at insurance.
Traditionally, most of the funds were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country is put in danger by moving forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible funds and other adult members of their households should go their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at immigration and duty management before the Congress, testified that the agency has arrested thousands of people who have made an application to secure unforgettable minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are insurance or family members of insurance are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have set new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to screw workers.
Many will appear via video conference calls, rather than in person, to deal with their case for legal status with an immigration lawyer.
Those who are considered inappropriate for emergency relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressive, which can lead to violent explosions or escape attempts, according to climbing workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates say that these concerns are raised at a greater facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child's suck is easier to mislead due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say respect to friends, the trauma can worsen which many already have to deal with.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish ‘Occupational Powers’ to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign powers are illegal on Syrian land, under the aim of fighting terrorism and will be "conducted accordingly."
"They must immediately withdraw and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moulem urged that the "war on terrorism" in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have died since 2011, with millions of more unroated.
He said Damascus would continue to "take this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "some illegal foreign presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, which usually trained and advised both the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-riding country.
About the issue of refugees, Moulem said the conditions are in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" to spread "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away."
"We have made an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these backwards," he said.
"They're politics that should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no rebuilding aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to raise a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebellion, created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the deal had "clear sperms" and expressed the hope that military action will shape jihadists, including soldiers of the al-Qaeda-bound Nusra Front that will "explore".
UN Officer, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon summon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and run the way to elections.
Moualem has prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be restricted to the "government of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against intervention.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of charge and scandalous ending his presidency early.
There is no doubt that "the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be!"
Until now, there are no signs of viewing doubt.
Since 2014, spectators have more than doubled up to 1.05 million at CCN and almost doubled up to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators, at 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is on cable spectators with as many as 3.5 million spectators on large news.
"This is a fire to which people are dressed because it's not something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he lets me lie," he said. Scovell told me.
There is a value of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on the TV, the stories that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can harm and the health of the world economy.
To switch off is a luxury that can only be affordable to the most preferred viewers.
And yet it goes further than just being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it to see a panel of experts discussing about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 full-time flyer flying bag ("a thick piece of clothing of the hubris, m.

"Parts of what he makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role sharing and daily kicks in the plot (such as looking for a dispute with N.F.L., Kim-Jong).

External cash flow to the most exciting mid-term election swedlope in Home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flow of money, thanks to a shift of congress districts that have now left two officials in a race for the same seat.
The newly changed Pittsburgh district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb to measure forces – which won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another officer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th Pennsylvania district, which overcomes with the new 17th.
The maps were retreated after the Pennsylvania High Court in January determined that the old districts were illegally displaced in the favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th ended with a campaign funding competition between the big parties' financial bones, the Democratic Fielding Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Fielding Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a necklace win in a widely regarded special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given a little advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. considered to penalize El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then rejected
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, with little opposition to Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners issued the Trump Organization's leadership span.
Officials of the state ministry decided to revoke the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the Department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines are only considered against El Salvador that received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reduction in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder figures.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials just issued a high-level Congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow a similar meeting last year, which has been considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the Congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now destined to speak to the Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the severity of the assembly for the administration, the diplomat said.
And the three American songs returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or strings from Washington.
Withuis spokesman for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultation under the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Studying History
The next thing that can happen may be the special consultation on Mr. Mueller's report on the possible bombing of the law, of which there are now many significant witnesses in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also suspected to focus on his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign has worked with Russia in the country's attack on our elections.
If Congress had passed in other hands, Mr. Trump would have to take responsibility in the face of that body, just when he is ready to go back to the voters, and perhaps at the end of a jury of his portrait group.
This is a lot of axis, and with this I don't want to know that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – and not that of his epics in Europe.
There are decisions to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how much the battle can be extended.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to execute a state strike against Hitler, when the West just stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and an opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the years resulting.
The course of history turns to such rotations and the unmeaning course of democracy is delayed or delayed.
Americans are now in the face of a number of such turns.
What will we do as Mr. Trump's adjunct prosecutor-general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's destiny?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to take the president into secret and speculate about whether he is competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's report is inappropriate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not fully or just – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And, above all, we will vote for a congress that will remain responsible for Mr. Trump in the inter-election?
If we do this, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovaki Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government who lived in my embassy at a time.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to fire Sabbath researchers on the table wearing the swastika.
With this, if I come back, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers's Graham Dorrans optimists for Rapid Vienna
Rangers play for Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that victory over the Austrian Rikers, after the impressive equation in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will be placed in a strong position to qualify for Group G of Europe League.
A knee control prevented medieval player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumping place for bigger things.
"This was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something and went away with a point.
We might have won it at the end, but an equation calculation is probably a just result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and was the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can get pressure and get a positive result.
Last year it was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my infections and the changes at the club, but now there is a well-being factor in the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we're going to be successful, we've been sitting behind the past season."
Women lost their sleep over these fears of deprivation
Despite the fact that recorders have a clear idea of how they want to be taken care of, few people talk to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their parents about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's Life Insurance Business.
Here's the truth to start.
Talk to your husband and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes long before the time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you come up with a way forward to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Explore your legal documents: Cut the corrections at the same time.
Get a healthcare force in place so that you indicate a familiar individual to keep careful about your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Also consider perfect for your finances.
You have to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid if you are inactivated.
Don't forget the small details: tell yourself that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details out in a written plan so that you are ready.
"That's not just the financial issues, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with wind bucks
A man shot several times with a wind bucket when he stopped at home and went out after a night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooter, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as a "weekly act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Her infections are not life-threatening and the police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and zoenamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city Palu on Friday, officials said, and the deaths are expected to rise.
With communications set out outside action, emergency officers could not get any information from Donggala government, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-dimensional shooting.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are a few key mistakes about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a rainy company that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northern west of Sulawesi Island.
The rain, an administrative area under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishery and farming are the support pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, particularly the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining building is also important in the province, but is usually concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been shot several times over the past 100 years by zoenamis, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A Tsoenami also hit West Dongguan in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and zoenamis of the last few years:
2004: A large smuggling along the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 leading to a tsunami hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shootings left the west coast of Sumatra in March and hit early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-sized size hit the south of Java, Indonesia is the most populated island, leading to a zonemi that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-volume scooting occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-sized squad hit one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, leading to a zoenami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat screw struck the Pidie Jaya government in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of deadly screw and zoenami in 2004.
This time it didn't lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of buildings that have fallen down,
2018: Large shootings hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, usually on the northern side of the island.
The shooting destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and convicted of arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he pulled a woman's phone to her when she called the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is arrested at Mat-Su Pre-Earth Facility and is maintained at $500 uninsured insurance, reports KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, definitely" when asked what he claims, the network reported.
Palin holds three class A performances in the face, which means it can be arrested for up to one year and fined $250 000.
He is also accused of a class B performance, punishable with a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time there are criminal complaints against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of accusing his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently in Alaska's Veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interfering with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while he was drunk, related to the incident.
She claimed that she had a box in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after joining her son's behaviour with PTSD as a consequence of her duty to serve in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-sized earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are set outside action with death figures expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake just hit outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media that shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in Palu when the zoenami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects of NYC terrorist attacks
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused eight deaths – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, claimed to use a Home Depot hire engine to carry out an attack on a bike road along the West Side fastway in Lower Manhattan to run pedestrians and a bicycle rider on his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "dedicated" killed the eight victims and "dedicated" serious physical contamination, according to the announcement of the purpose of requesting the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury Saipov killed 22 accused, including eight murder charges against oppression, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crimes, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "correct planning and anticipation", prosecutors said, and described the way Saipov carried out it as "arrogant, cruel and pervers".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the intentional report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York has actually pursued a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two drug dealers, but finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was killed after their imprisonment for a complot to execute spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were placed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accused.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He was accused of the 22 accused.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty instead of accepting a guilt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release, will only extend the trauma of these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence effort had previously asked persecutors not to wish the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in management of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has promised to mobilise "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the "hot" of Euroskeptici - as one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in the management of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone said for March in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" at the time if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faced to unite her deeply distributed officers is by encouraging pro-Romain Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister challenged to keep her Chequers compromise plan on the drive in the middle of attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Bond colleagues urged that by pressing her efforts to go on an agreement with Brussels despite the death toll – and Euroskeptici and Working forced to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said for the Launch Launch Launch Congress in Solihull he "wanted to eradicate Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should be made a noble man and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in control, we would have been out of time," he said.
Wellingborough-LP added: "I'm going to stand up for Brexit, but we have to eliminate Chequers."
He expressed his opposition to the EU and said: "We haven't fought world wars to be subject.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone has shown that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to be happy is totally untrue.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also in March and told reporters: “I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are elected first.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Ms. May, she added: "First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farge said the meeting politicians had to feel the "hot" if they were on the drumpel to make the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now about a trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They try to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we won’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to have our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, to make the heat feel.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country who gave our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governmental, proud UK."
At the same time, Remainers marched by Birmingham before they held an assembly for two hours in the middle of the city.
A couple of activists have pushed Tories against Brexit banners this week to the group's presentation.
Employees Lord Adonis sought the conservative case for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference.
"That's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a general clever.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to look ‘hard after’ to be president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she will "harden afterwards to stand for president" in the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a city hall meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for reelection in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's already in the middle of reflection that her Trump might be challenging in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A resident asked her if she planned to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and this includes a woman far above.
arrested in shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11am.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help to identify a man seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims shot in the head and eventually died as a result of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde entered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, in possession of a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
A 6-foot-6 younger who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 matches with 10 original late seasons and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 backballs per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton's world title after team commands give him his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday for Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes's team commands would play a major role in the rides.
From paal position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the puddles and Hamilton dissolved to ride a lot behind the bowl in traffic, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes jumped a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-to-wheel action that the Ferrari driver desperately risk-free saw the inside left at risk of retention after a double movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear run of the road jumper and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large portion of the journeys as he kept on his bands to quickly finish and steer Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He possibly entered the puddles in the 44th round, but couldn't accelerate his only in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had done fantastic a long week and was a real gentleman.
The team has done extraordinary work to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad lifting language.
President Donald Trump argued at a meeting of Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday that she did not read Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which her High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia and did not directly respond to the testimony made by Ford before the Senate Court Committee. Instead, he commented that what is going on in the Senate indicated that people were "common and unjust and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the good thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are evil, miserable, and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and lecks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you like it?
Remember her answer... have you read the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't like it."
Well, wait a little.
"No, we didn't read it," he added, in a statement from the Senate.
Feinstein was sent to the letter that made the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was previously leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leakage came out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't read her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not well respect her rejection and commented during Saturday's assembly: "I tell you what. It was a good bad lifting language.
Maybe it's not, but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the High Court-nominated accused by three women of sexual disability and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take it back with any necessary means.
You see the community, the dishonesty, they don't give to who they conquer, who they have to free to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars agreed for Friday's Elite League's loss against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's 5-3 match in Dundee.
The Giants got an early two-purpose leadership by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equivalented the housewife before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equated Dundee before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen goals made their victory.
This was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men who lost first matches and then won Friday Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull aid, with David Rutherford who had the aid area when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In what was a big opening period, Sullivan regained the home span at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider of Cownie's equivalent at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead to the first break when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The house was regrouped and Bouchard, on the other hand, got them with a power goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen to let Dundee lead for the first time in the match in the second half and he made sure that he won with his team's fifth point halfway through the final halfway.
The Giants who now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next match Friday.
Air traffic manager dies to ensure hundreds of airplanes can escape earthquake
An air traffic operator in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after he died when he made sure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people has risen safely.
More than 800 people have died and more are missing after a large earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong snakes in the area and many have been captured in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that was very swallowing at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airports in Palu.
He remained unmovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was at that time on the runway, was able to rise safely.
He jumped out of the traffic control tower on the day he entered it.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokeswoman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We have a heart breaking to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the country's disaster agency that says access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still increasing as many figures are still under the bulbs while many are still unable to reach," agency spokeswoman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Goals reaching up to six meters, Palu smells that will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and stock.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance into the body.
Water is scarce.
"The minimums are loaded everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hunting to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask almaI of you to work day and night to complete every task related to extinction.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
In the early years, Indonesia was attacked by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia aircraft accident: Air Niugini says a man is missing after a beach airplane accident
The airline that handled an airplane that landed in a Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared after they previously said that 47 passengers and crew have safely escaped the falling plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they couldn't give a male passenger account.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and spiders to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airports.
On Friday, the police said seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact consequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. fleet both said the aircraft landed in the beach near the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others got it right to walk through mid-deep water to the emergency inputs on the falling plane.
He said the air guards had touched panic arrests and shouted, and he had a small headache.
The U.S. fleet said vessels working close to improving a cage also helped with an inflammatory boat with the rescue to get people around and back on land before the plane in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicate that 111 people have died in collapse of PNG-registered airstrikes in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in an accident.
Analysts set timeline different from the night that a woman was burnt alive
The state closed her case on Saturday in the re-appointment of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice-Analyst Paul Rowlett has witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He set out for the jury how he used phone records to put the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, together the evening he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were the night of her death, which was in contrast to her previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he said he was at his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford told Saturday that he wasn't in the city that day.
When the accusers asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said he was at Sanford's trail that night, Sanford said he "yeah, because my trail was in Nashville."
Another inconsequence is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks after his death.
Telephone records indicated that they knew each other for just a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He's got her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence was scheduled to start its final day Sunday.
The judge said he expected the hearing to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent reign in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Is there a black person?!
NY-Children juffles day-to-day couples because they're "rassistic" text
A New York-children girl gives a pair of discriminatory thoughts after she received a misdirected message from the mother who complained she was "a black person."
The couple denied that they were racists and compared the dispute with "dispersing."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-year-old mother, escaped her disturbance when she found that the new child career, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo."
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to me Maurice.
After her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman denied me Maurice and said that their outgoing childhood girlfriend who was African-Americans had done bad work and that she had previously expected a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent with a Uber home.
Now Maurice travels to the couple for compensation for the debt and seeks her compensation up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, residential work for which she was originally designated, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that good," she told the post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the claims that they were racists and said it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's engagement and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
"We're not racists," the man told Joel Plasco.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were uncircumcised, even if it had been abusive?"
Your newborn father?
Give us."
Plasco compared the case with "dispersing" and said that his wife would have had a baby over two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're just going to a person?
"It's not a good thing to do," the banker added.
While the case continues, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple to social media and to catch them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a spoken bear would not link readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would be worried if her work was rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the child book about the small toys. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "bittersoet" last year.
About Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was silently proud of her ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an applause man," she said.
"But because Paddington's husband was for him, it was almost as if a man had a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not your job.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was hunted to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2-hospital, where doctors were exaggerated to save her life.
"After a regular call to say that it was quite bad, they didn't expect that she would do it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got Nad's call to say she would die in the next two minutes and I had to greet her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine given by the doctors to hold her heart on the cliff was slowly busy to get up and leave her system.
She was a while before she died and the body was about to close.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was a kidnapping.
I couldn't think or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to do it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who at that time had been seized for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers - unconscious of the trial he had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head shaken, and the trails fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Female postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from living their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's postcards have been on a Walliese bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at 18 years old.
"I don't want a parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an inflammatory smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They have always said that their smile has explained any departure."
However, he left work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm worried that there will be a domino effect."
Davis has designed the cards, "to let people know there are people outside to whom you can go to and with whom you can talk, although it's a friend.
Don't be silent - you need to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, has lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sick or depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't get in touch with them or did anything with them."
She said her death had many traumas, but they had to work there: "This is a hole through the family for a while.
That's going to make us different.
We all have to go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as the FBI investigates
"I thought if we could actually get something like for which he asked - a timeless investigation that didn't cost - we might have brought a little unit," Mr. Flake said Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was about to "fall out" among various partisan meetings.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to set up the FBI's investigation?
It's all because of the time calculation.
The inter-elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans will go badly, then they will be very weakened in their efforts to get the man who wants to choose them to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the Withuis and who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that Mike Pence, the Vice President, will allow to break a balance sheet and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean runners counts ‘down’ under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-Seug reported data from the Southern Unity Cabinet and said there were 1,127 overlaps last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said stricter border management between North Korea and China and higher rates requested by human engineers have become key factors.
Pyongyang did not give public comments.
The vast majority of South Korean citizenship law is finally offered.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flying through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to pass than the high-protective demilitarised zones (DMS) between the two Koreans.
China looks at overseers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South - who have always been technically spoken in war with each other - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that focused around the ongoing negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came after the historical meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the core-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has inflamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of proceedings since Saturday.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally will disarma ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries", says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh "histeries" and said he was temperamentally incapable of serving at the High Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help think that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say 'histeries'," Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate government committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional allegations that he sexually insulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teens.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional and he almost cried out for a while while discussing his family and high school years.
He also expressly rejected Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a "legal and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were evil that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it proved that he was a prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself unkompetent with those claims and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was worried when she was asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and as a Democrat, she won the majority in the House.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not entitled to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court where he is right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a lawyer at the D.C. Ommegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Act on Affordable Care or Roe v. Wade as he is treated a conservative right.
In her confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would review certain High Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, predetermined person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not amazing,' Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of anger that cook, and she can't find it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helpful by a woman who was an executive officer, who also said her crying when she became angry, but developed a technique that meant when she became angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she spoke with, "You think I'm sad.
I'm angry."
And then she just went.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Trane is allowed as a partial outlet for toom because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my hardest reminders of an early work in a male-dominated office is where I once found that I was crying with nominee anger and caught at my neck by an older woman - a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid - which slept me in a t-rapport.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they have had an impact on you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was dismissed in a foreign-marriage relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the trips, Schroeder, very frustrated me, realized that there was no reason she could not investigate the idea that she could run for the president.
"I didn't think about the decision," she told me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one.
Someone called it "Snowlife and the Seven Virgins."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with findings collections and so she promised that she wouldn't deny the roads unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that her supporters gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do you think I'm going to get back?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she wouldn't leave a formal campaign, her surprise was by emotions - grateful to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and make voters rather than delegates, and anger for sexism - that she has grown up.
"You would have thought I had a nervous insufficiency," said Schroeder to me about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate bond.
I remember what I thought, what would they sit on my tomb?
"He's crying?"
How the U.S. China Trade War could be good for Beijing
The opening balances of the trade war between the U.S. and China were overwhelmed and while the struggle has been over, a disagreement between the countries may in the long term be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week, the most interesting scale enrolled with new rates affecting $200 trillion (£150 trillion) items and effectively half of the goods taxed in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has taken a return to goods every time and has recently climbed rates from five to ten percent to $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to equate the U.S. shooting to shoot and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
Geting Washington to stand back means giving up requests, but meeting U.S. requests in public will be too much of a grant to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays his cards right, pressure on U.S. trade war can be positively supported over the long-term China by reducing mutual dependence on the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the condition that can start an economic toll air in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the center of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria's ‘prepared’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country were improved.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure because of progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists, normally.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that led to their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people living in the country still need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the land.
However, he insisted that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that secured the invasion.
Europe sees Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Span Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Span U.S. with a final point of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who shocked for most of the tournament, left his T-housing in the water at the 16th par-3 game and awarded his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian gholf player Molinari has remained in all of its rounds and has become one of the 1-van-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The US Jordan Spieth is 5&4 exploded by the lowest-rated player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest ranking player, Dustin Johnson, had 2 and 1 cases to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European winner of the tournament of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I'm not crying, but I can't help it today.
It was a rough year.
Thanks to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
"It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia.
He's a great fan of his countrymate John Ram who won the U.S. aid Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday in a single game.
"The incredible pride I feel, to overcome Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at the old man," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of the 13-21-3 race Ryder race record.
A strange statistic by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Span U.S. has been shocked for a long week to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber gholf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we put a bit of warmth in Europe.
We've failed.
It's for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to serve as a captain.
You need to keep your head shades.
We're over."
