Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away: On Tuesday, the new B 33-foot temple was launched in Gutach at the village parkplatz - in the vicinity of the old Rathaus temple.
Two plants are so close to each other: intention or shadow citizenship?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach’s mayor yesterday.
"The Rathaus ampul was then installed because it secures the schoolway," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel secured both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The installation officially operated yesterday is important for the cruise area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the residential area 'Grub'.
"In the high traffic and pedestrian arrival, there had to be another ample for their safety," Eckert said.
This also confirms Peter Arnold by the Offenburg Landratsamt.
“According to current measurements on the B 33, the municipality of Gutach is about 12 000 vehicles per day, of which about 10 percent of heavy cargo transport,” Arnold stressed.
Consequently, the construction of another ample is more than necessary: “Safety is simply going on here,” Arnold said.
A total of four traffic views were carried out, a circular traffic was also expected, but was rejected due to the narrow in the cruise area of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, it was tested at the location of the amplifiers: "We have tested the means of an extra for us with particularly long wooden loaded carriers, whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without screwing the amplifiers."
The costly amplifier of about €15,000 itself is “the most modern thing that is currently on the market,” explained Arnold.
The facility is equipped with colorful LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights of the drivers are well recognized, for example, even in deep sun.
And it is also savings: the older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lights per direction.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the apple button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, green comes directly for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
“If a group or disabled people go through the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safely on the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver here should think as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: Kaum showed the ample for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle broke through - with bright red.
Joseph Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth for over 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hanging to cruel violence and stubborn sexuality, the narrowness and joyfulness - have often described the core poet.
The bookmaker is especially known as a pro-author, and theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Weather lights on the tongue head", which is now seen in the garage X on Petersplatz, therefore a collage from Prosatexts.
The theatermaker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family enchanting" (2003).
On the largely dark scene - an important requisite: a broken sofa on which it is clearly accumulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
The director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a lot of regio incidents known from the repertoire of postdramatic play forms.
Especially the actresses are at times somewhat questionable stage implementations.
They are hard touched, with the head under water, with their evening rods to the wall.
When entry walls in cellophan or mieders, they stack on dangerous high stains through the inscension, either monologize them loudly or lie completely distorted on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly transmitted in this narrow manner.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song.
Only at the end of the overwhelming performance comes somewhat quiet, and Winkler's follow-up absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a money source to repair the falling highway system, and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that is located in each car’s armature board.
The equipment that records every driven kilometre and reports the information to the authorities is the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the U.S. Planning Office to revise the old system for the financing of U.S. roads.
The rather boring area of road planning has suddenly distorted an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have bound themselves to environmental groups and agree that the government can use the small boxes to record the dropped kilometers – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax margins.
The tea party is annoyed.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
However, while you can’t agree on an action at Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system in which the driver pay per mile drive over the next ten years.
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the travel recorders, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we can only use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the driven miles to all California drivers in the state by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes that the Americans are paying off at the saffron column, is pledged.
In America, however, there is no longer as much thought as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per Gallone (less than 4 euros per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don’t wage at high split prices, they only raise the tax for a cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
The state has recently equipped 500 cars with travel writers to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the long-term most meaningful alternative,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is in line with urban liberals, because taxes could, for example, take advantage of driving behaviour to reduce steam and climate-harmful emissions.
The California planners set on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enacted climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is seeing the most long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also motivated by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for a backed route.
“This is no tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Policy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Ministers who in a 2011 report called for Congress to move towards milestone bills.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $90 million expensive pilot project that would cover 10,000 cars.
However, the majority of the House of Representatives prevented the prejudice and thus responded to the concerns of rural deputies, representing people who often have to leave many miles on the way to work or back to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and large cities are moving on their own in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, currently employing 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay meal taxes instead of mineral oil taxes to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers this.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministry of 17 states on the eastern coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, car drivers were skeptical when thinking that the government could track any of their movements.
“The worries about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,” Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and outcome management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test arrived, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the travel writers into adult monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a giant, locked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that now look at affordable technology, with which the state can capture the driven kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan would also be more calm to the public.
The hunting for this technology led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company was originally not joined to help federal states in the taxation of drivers.
Instead, their goal was to take foot in a rising market for Kfz insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles.
However, its tested devices are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is uploaded regularly by modem.
“People are rather willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made big mistakes.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no equipment at all and instead pay a pause fee based on the average mile driven by all residents of the state.
Others hope to sell the concept of a misreliable public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxes that also allow parking charges, pay insurance only for driven kilometers and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to the car driver Staus.
“Car drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,” the city’s planning document says.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay, officials said the Congress could solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional single fees or annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles consuming low gasoline, so they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough,” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of law and public affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of car drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfeld: Small team is swinging up
The volunteer firefighter managed her autumn sample despite personal deficiencies with bravour.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise statement.
There will be a short-lived closure when it comes to singing.
Due to the fire and smoking development, two people were injured, one of which could send an emergency call.
After the first review of the case by Hans Kammerer, two respiratory carriers were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it managed to find the first person and get to the free.
The second person had to be weared.
This was not so easy to overcome as a narrow staircase was too.
The building, a workshop with integrated stall for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood in it and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machines for wooden processing.
The first deletion attack took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another wire was carried out via an overwhelming hydrate in about 100 meters away.
Now, three deletion attacks could be developed.
There was also a hollow radiation tube in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in showing what is to be done with little staff available.
In serious cases, support is made through the day-to-day operation group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of high schools and companies is important
In his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, Landing President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee New City of where the workers came from tomorrow.
In the Förder Centre Hochschwarzwald, he studied this important issue along with the leading school leaders of the vocational schools, the Circle Gymnasium and the parental counsellors.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school education centre highschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration between the Forest Centre, the Circus Gymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the family friendship in the countryside.
“It is important not only to have the family phase in view, but also due to demographic changes, the phase of care for relatives,” Wolf explained.
In addition, he argued that more and more employees took care of their relatives and care.
"Without the support of the employer, the resulting burden of employees can lead to a cessation of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can allow himself to lose qualified workers,” he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already met the advantages of the region during their study remain with their acquired knowledge and skills often to the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," the country president said.
For only if adequate training places are offered, the need for professionals can also be covered.
In his view, the location advantage of the country district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, directly close to France and Switzerland.
In addition, he experienced the efforts already made to expand the public transport of passengers on his train from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Continue to be harsh and make sure that public transport is better," he explained to the address of the present municipal politicians.
Experience a fun afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family invites the dieting seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a vesper.
Earlier, the elderly co-citizens were invaded in the rash site.
Today this afternoon takes place in St. Joseph’s Nursing House.
The homeowners are looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was worm salad.
With common melodies, Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as a predecessor delimitation of the old schoolhof to the Kirchstraße before the restoration is to be resettled on the Brüunlingen city’s restoration cost plan.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was built in the first work of the renovation of the front schoolhouse, to stabilize and static discharge of the more than 100-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further proceedings are planned, as Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger City Building, incorporating the country’s memorandum into the plans and establishing a reconstruction concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be carried out by professionals, which will then be put on the table to the Municipal Council for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be taken already next year.
After the regeneration, plastering and tree planting of the old schoolhof within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it must be used in a predictable time as a follow-up to the regeneration-needed limitation walls to be sanated and put on new under construction.
The historic, one hundred-year-old delimiting wall of the old schoolhouse to the church street is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, refining necessary and has a bowling in advance.
Deep rises in individual stones bear witness to weather damage, but the wall is currently not in danger of intrusion.
A securer wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use schoolhof, which is carried out by the current fixation work.
Originally, the school court was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure caused a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall rehabilitation, which has already been used for filming, will correspond to the country’s memory.
If provisions come from this page, then the city Brüunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monumental protectors.
Students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-healed old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old school.
Özdemir wants Jazza training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of Baden-Württemberg music schools, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Greens, has now entered into.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic education at the Stuttgart Music College," Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter News".
Jazz and classic are just in the jazz station Stuttgart.
To this end, Özdemir, who is considered a favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate at the Bundestag election on September 22, opposes the Green-Red National Government.
This, on the basis of an expert study, forced a rearrangement of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music School to the Mannheim Music School.
U.S. border: "Supertunnel" discovered for drug trafficking
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and set a "supertunnel" against drug trafficking.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the pipeline of more than 500 meters between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroads and a ventilation facility.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel has not yet been used according to the data.
"These cards are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar," Laura Duffy, U.S. State Attorney of Southern California, said at a press conference in a San Diego warehouse where the end of the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy said, “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge loss of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. officials and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cardinal.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The grinding facility was equipped so that electrically operated cars could be installed there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to authorities, a guide leads to the depth of 20 meters to the actual tunnel loan entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
He would also be able to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was captured due to the captured marijuana.
All three are threatening as a maximum punishment of lifelong liberty withdrawal, officials said.
Since 2006, eight of these tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
However, it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug bands whose traditional routes have been cut in the meantime," Bill Sherman said from the drug industry DEA in San Diego.
You would do everything you can to get to the United States.
No details were reported to the arrested, at least one of the Mexicans, he said.
You have to wait for prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 is Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
Repeat of the first special mention is becoming increasingly closer.
If the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary will end.
Geishas and church houses were mentioned for the first time together.
In churches, a document was produced in which both places were mentioned.
On March 15, there will be an official opening for the anniversary, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event takes place in the place, where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the Jubilee, several events are planned in both Geisingen and Church Houses.
Church Houses will be held in July on a Friday week from July 18 to July 20, 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a festact, on Saturday and Sunday with a fest around the Kirchtal Hall.
In addition, this weekend is also the Church-Hausener Church Festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, listed on three dates.
On June 21, along with the sunny celebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12, in the fireworks Arena and on December 13, as the first concert of city music in the new festival.
This will be completed in the anniversary year, the official date is last September week, 27 and 28 September.
In the event of the Geisinger city’s anniversary, a new chronicle will be released.
"But it should be a chronology not only of geising themselves, but also a printed work on the geising of today, which consists of geising, church houses, leipzigs, aulfingen, and goodmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today’s Geisingen celebrates 2014 Birthday, 1974 the current space was implemented with the encompasses.
The new chronology will then be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also a year with many birthdays.
The Crazy Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a night of time at the moment of its 60-year-old existence, the Harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years old and has the fixed bankett on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Old Work Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen Music Association is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the spring festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a Schönkung document, which is in possession of the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was produced in churches (houses), which was then courtyard.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250th year accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform remains 40 years back.
The Council takes Gleeing Plants into the Visier
Should the railway transfer "Am Hirschen" be reconstructed in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schillach has to take €2200,000 in hand.
The German Railway will improve the Kinzigtal railway route next year.
In particular, the safety of train transitions should be increased – regularly, there are collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the municipalities vote for the restructuring measures, they must participate in the costs of a third, the rest of the rail and bond.
Schiltach's municipal baumeist Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specificities of the train transition "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an excavation in the height of the tunnel tunnel west of the railroad.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting long wood, in contrast to traffic without having to block the road.
Greyhaver therefore proposed to build a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could extend the next road to a given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the Municipal Council, as some advisers questioned the need for road dissemination: Thomas Kipp put the mood of the critics on the point: “Do we take so much money in hand for so few vehicles?”
Mayor Thomas Haas spoke against: The train transfer "Hirschen" is used regularly for long-haired transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area will be partially transported over this route, because the vehicles that are up to 20 meters long cannot use the route on the bridge because they cannot go to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that may not use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
As it is expected that the Kirchberg and Castlesberg tunnels should be reconstructed and restored, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway transfer "Am "Erschen" may also have an important significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the expected spread of the road.
Regardless of this, the conversion of the train transition was majority agreed with the provision that the necessary support wall is built so that the city can expand the next road towards "train road" if applicable for meeting traffic at about 5.5 meters.
On the contrary, the transformation of the railway transition at the Gerberei vineyard could lead to a very different problem that concerns access to the strongly rising "Roltz houses road".
The administration had examined the Umbaup plans of the railway from the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as it had doubts whether the planned connection to the Geroltzhaus Wegs would then be possible without any further.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the road’s inclination conditions could lead to longer vehicles sitting.
The responsibility for this is the city as a street construction carrier.
Convergence can therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood transportation and the abbreviation functioned in the current state of expansion, it should not be agreed to the rebuilding of the railway transition, Haas argued.
It is also at this point that the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than with the other train transitions, because it is located directly next to the stop center, to which there is a good vision connection.
Even trains from the main station should be suspended at this point so far that no collision is at risk.
Mostly, the reconstruction of this railway transition was rejected as the city of Schiltach had to "employ the problem with seated vehicles", as the advice, as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work was completed.
It is unproblematic that the Board considers the buildings at the train transitions "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been reached.
It decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency have now to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets on other stars have already been found by astronomers.
At least there is life on some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Do you need to search for gravity waves?
Or do you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or discovering similar planets and perhaps discovering alien life?
The European Space Agency (ESA) is now responsible for these questions.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are crucial to advance research.
The state for such "L-missions" is about a billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were standing for the debate, five of which have now come into the closer election.
Several bodies examined the proposals and followed by the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions, the Esa has chosen to find answers to the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision program.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives?
The precise processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the pretextual dark.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this dark.
What if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life occur there?
To address this question, in 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched, which will further examine 500 already known planet systems in our closer environment.
The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers can illustrate Earthly planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to ultimately find out what conditions there are for the creation of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the radiation of particles resulting from it with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be exemplaryly examined.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (which is the budget of about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The sonde is to start in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his monde.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, Esa presents the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is intended to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ice world of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that can show physicians the way to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How was the universe created and what is it made up of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Urknall.
In addition to the current matter, from the stars, planets and living beings as we are, there is dark matter, the gravity of galaxies and galaxies, and the dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe is accelerated.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second breakthroughs of the Urknal, nor from which Dark Material and Dark Energy consist.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved an M mission, which is scheduled to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sonde is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Only two of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process.
The best chances of enabling an L-mission has, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a challenging concept of proof of gravity waves.
Among them, physicians understand changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could do this, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission shows a two- or three-song detector that is stationed in all.
Unlike plants on Earth, he could also demonstrate gravity waves that were created at the Urknall, thus providing new knowledge about the creation of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore, among other things, black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the external planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and see the "Exoplanet Finder"
For example, proposals for sampling return transport from Mars, for exploring moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as solar physics.
Snowden is ready to "coop" with Germany in relation to U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, said he was willing to travel to Berlin and declare before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not give answers to their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received the asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, presented by Ströbele on Friday to the media in Berlin, he writes: “Even if the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a divergence of opinion as a breakdown of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political opinions with penalty, where there is no defence possible.”
To say the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the US government to put the charges against him.
The charge brought by the U.S. Department of Justice includes spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to enable this.”
The relations between the United States and Germany are charged by the allegations, the NSA has heard the phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, who is heading the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said that you should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without threats to him and completely ruin the relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a deputy of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Stroble said the former NSA employee’s lawyer Snowden could not return to Russia when he left the country.
When Snowden said in Germany, he needed a guarantee that he was "safe" there, he said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he has been exposed to a “hearted and ongoing” persecution campaign that has driven him out of his home.
However, he has been affected by the global response to “my act of political opinion”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit to the general community.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation, “if the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved.”
Frontier Airlines raises charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 of passengers who want to hide hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or limonade, even if it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers would likely keep the whole dosage.
The new fee applies for hand luggage in the luggage box above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.
Frontier said you would calculate $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travellers only paying at the flight.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the charge of $100 aims to move travellers in advance to take care of the payment.
“We don’t want to calculate that sum,” she said.
In 2008, airlines began requiring charges for the first and second baggage.
As a result, passengers who tried to overcome them have put as much in the hand luggage as possible, resulting in that the luggage covers are often filled over the seat.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee isn't really about making money.
It’s about Frontier’s most loyal customers who have clearly expressed that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find space over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a baggage for free at the arrival of Frontier, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable baggage.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive on the departure.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee enters into force only in the summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often shield with luggage supplies and other fees, but airlines would like to take it back.
They argue that the transportation of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish it.
Many at Wall Street consider the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss.
However, most still leave the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fees for hand luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a cheap flight.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline adviser Jay Sorensen, who carefully tracks the additional fees.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the hand luggage charged Spirit would spend $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who had previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect on the flight if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the most relentless things I’ve experienced in my airline race,” he said.
I expected to see toothbrushes and handheld discussions on the flight.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding runs as smitten.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who purchased lemonade or juice ought to keep the whole dose and be filled with coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to ask for money for refreshing drinks in 2008, but it resumed seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had been trapped.
Frontiers step to raise charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to target customers on their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This encourages all companies to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the most widespread in this area.
In September, the company started to spend only half the number of multiple miles when booking an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut again to 25% of the flight route.
A flight with more than 1000 miles from a third-party provider, therefore, brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book places only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business crashes and the company loses money.
The revenue decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the mother group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to handle the finances of Frontier as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women’s breakfast this year in the evangelical church community Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal house were "words from the Bible" and "redacts from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, chairman of the Church Council, went into a lecture on the Bible’s words after breakfast.
"Special words contain lifestyles, regulations or warnings," she said.
She compared several words with the corresponding Bible points and explained the meaning.
And she said, Be careful, as the woods fall out of the eyes, and look upon someone, whom the LORD gives in sleep, and wash his hands in innocence.
Repeatedly, the speaker also advised their listeners on what proverb was.
The talks from the Middle Ages took place by the church board Christel Dehner: All good things are three, make blue, something distorted.
She explained the significance and origin of the speech expenditure that she called "bridges in the past".
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also the Mayor Candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learn instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unemployed in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Lake Plate, a pilot project was launched for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already uninstructed in the industry will be qualified over three winters as professionals for hotels and hospitals.
"Now it is that the six-month courses end with graduations," Carmen Wiechert from the Newbrandenburg Labour Agency said.
The benefit is varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies were trained by professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and hospitals, and the agency should not finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Trade in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel and Gaststätten Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA declares a “intern error” and not hackers to blame for the crash of the website
The shadowful National Security Agency stated late Friday that a mistake had defeated their public website for a few hours and not hackers, as they were claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight as an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in a message sent by email.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In early evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the speaker said.
At least a group of hackers used the NSA website to deploy with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose name once was No Search Agency (no such authority) is now found in light of the public, and looks at the revelations that have been made known in recent months about its extensive monitoring program in both the country and abroad – a result of the secret NSA work and Snowden’s previously published data.
The growing controversy about the secret service has inflicted initial speculations on the fact that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyber surgery.
The number of unemployed people in October has decreased slightly from 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1% better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped more," Monika Felder-Buer, Deputy Executive Director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen, said.
Many companies have responded to behaving in settings so far.
A reason for this, according to Felder-Buier, is: “We hardly have professionals in craftsmanship, healthcare and old care.”
Year-round seasons have also been recruiting employment offers for staff in the hotel and guesthouse industry since September.
In mid-December the winter season begins.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer Display Leaf of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Winning inputs at Bombardier after falling in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decline in net profit on Thursday, after falling under pressure by declining orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway party.
Bombardier, headquartered in Montreal, also published no flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft, and no new information on whether the aircraft could be commercially used in accordance with the ambitious schedule for next September.
Only three more starts have been followed on the flight of the test plane a month and a half ago, which makes it possible to see whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a decline of over 8 percent at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of “outperformance” to “sector performance” in order to have a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.
“Although weaker delivery numbers in aircraft were expected largely, we are clearly disappointed by the development of the margins in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program advances for the aircraft.
However, if new orders will not be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries airplane series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177 as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new Düsseldorf transport aircraft are applicable.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The company’s management also secured on Thursday against analysts and media, the program is in the schedule.
“The test plane was no longer left on the ground than expected,” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft’s stand time had been installed ground tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then join a review period, whatever we did.
This happens during the entire flight schedule.
The second in five test planes will be expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest soon afterwards, said the company.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft in operation for 12 months after the ferry flight.
Bombardier said it would review the launch plan (EIS) and update it in the coming months.
“The slow forwarding of the flight test – even though they obviously match Bombardier’s internal planning – strengthens our view that the launch moves to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million and 8 cents per share of $172 million and 9 cents per share of the year earlier.
The customized profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
The sales declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order reserve in the Air and Space Division was $32.9 billion on September 30 and was unchanged on December 31.
“In the field of air and space, the results were within our requirements, but the low order entry and market conditions in general were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
The sales in the Air and Space Division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railroad manufacturer, announced that the sales in this spart increased by nearly eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order reserve in the Transport Party was $32.6 billion on September 30 and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by solving problems in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the mid-day trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share decreased by 8.5% and was 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google’s financial director Patrick Pichette would switch to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer in the world and the nearest rival of Bombardiers, reported a 10 percent decline in the quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shootings on Friday morning (local time) at LAX airport.
While the airport’s headquarters reported on Twitter that the guard was in detention, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
Media also reported several injured.
U.S. President Barack Obama will be continuously informed of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in terminal 3 eyewitnesses reported to have seen a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travellers were crying and crying.
Among the waiting panic broke out, many would have hid from fear behind chairs.
He heard two shots, a traveler from the Los Angeles Times said.
An employee of the TSA has suffered a shooting injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
Afterwards, he was brought into a security area, the man reported.
The shootings should be close to a security control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
On television images, it was seen how many medical and police cars were carrying in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought safely from the building.
Users published on Twitter photos of a special use command and a weapon on the ground.
According to the airport management on Twitter, the incident began at 9:30 a.m. (local time).
The access routes were shut down, which, according to CNN, formed a long backdrop.
Until landing the air traffic has been temporarily suspended, he said.
However, several aircraft were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is primarily served by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer, who warned the boss of drugs from police investigations, must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information to subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A known lawyer who warned a drug baron from a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug demand could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine desire.
The “first-class” lawyer named Bash was arrested in his house in 2011 after police Scarborough had supervised him in a former drug procedure.
Officials observed Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with his colleagues at a dinner in the lawyers' room.
The investigations suggested that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after finding traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards in tests.
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unlawful information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later after police secured 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine in cash in a series of home investigations.
Ditta, 42, provided information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, has been found guilty and convicted by the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two cases of disability of justice.
In a previous survey, he admitted the ownership of cocaine.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigative officials followed the suspect and saw he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a 60 percent purity in a black golf towel under the lawyer's tone.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium at Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, Ditta was known to be a “regular consumer” of cocaine after the drugs of class A were discovered in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards at tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but he argued to take cocaine and said he had talked to the alleged dealer because this is his client, and he claimed his discussion was subject to the "secret of lawyer".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
During the police interview, he stated that he operated a office under his private address and at the workplace, and customers would call him at home for legal affairs.
In court, it was announced that he had called for significant arrests and informed the investigators of important actors in drug trafficking, some of which he had previously represented.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer, as he has been very committed to certain customers.
The questionable relationship is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his statements were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of those persons.
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He acted against police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta brought his vocational status into rape.
He stood too close to certain customers, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
“If I was a corrupt lawyer and wanted to share information with Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a lawyer to a criminal at the moment he started buying drugs from organised criminals.”
His cocaine dependence led to an unholy compromise and made him welcome to the motives of leading members of the organized crime that ordered him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has rejected this trust and tried to move behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led investigations against Ditta, which also led to a sentence in three cases for possession of cocaine and justice disability, highlighting our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning for criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of prison after he declared himself guilty of the conspiracy for heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Fifty other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a field of questions and answers about himself, in which he said his dream job was to represent clients as a lawyer in the Death Cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and chance equality is the motivation for his work.
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To complete the celebrations of his 160-year-old existence, Dunningen’s singer kranz will frame two divine services with the “German Messe” by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the spectators enthusiastized in the spring of this year, the song cranes will enrich two divine services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair at St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, at 10:15 p.m. at the divine service at St. John Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Messe with the original title "Songs to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the Messe", D 872, is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the emergence.
The exhibition is listed as part of the Divine Services, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the chore is accompanied by the glacier group of the music universe Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis is slightly confident
For example, with the elections to the pastoral council in 2015, the basics will change in the soul care unit Haslach (SE).
There is then only one common council of priests for all six priests.
In a joint session on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared the changes.
Because there is nothing to change in the basic decisions of the diocese and it is necessary to implement them as satisfyingly as possible to the pastoral councils.
During the day, it was particularly clear: the skepsis towards the new is slightly but in view of confidence.
From the ideas and expectations to the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the pastoral council, the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the general staff of the soul team.
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained on a presentation the newly adopted guidelines for soul care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
In the future, the SE Haslach as a church community forms a body of public law that enters the rights and duties of six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a common council of priests and a foundation council, in which the priest's force of office is represented.
Of each parliament, at least two elected members must be represented, in the six parliaments, formed by the so-called community teams on site.
Your task will be to promote church life in the future.
In the question of the finances of the individual pastoral community, there was a significant need for talks.
The innovations predict that accumulated funds will remain targeted in the parliament.
The liabilities, on the contrary, go to the whole community.
There were great concerns with regard to the large planned investments, whose obligation would then meet all the parliamentary.
"In the past, it was only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual pastoral groups alone," Haslach's relative pastoral council president Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parliaments, Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried soul care unit, painted.
They had made themselves a task in 2006, "Become one, stay five" and had to find that it wasn't so easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Soul Care Unit then made it possible to respond to the questions about the future composition and size of the common pastoral council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concretized in further sessions and decided in a further joint session of the six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, the pastoral council Michael Schöner of Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity will be more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must pay higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the CEO of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, against the SÜDKURIER, a four-five Pfullendorfer family increases €70 to €90 extra cost per year.
Essential reason for the price rise is the rise of the so-called EEG range from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This conversion will be re-established every year by the four operators of the large current trails in October.
These account for the additional costs that they are arising from the energy rotation, which they can raise through a refund over the price of electricity.
The city works Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even been out of a higher turnover in its forecasts, reports Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete payments should be calculated before the city works could inform their customers next week about the exact price rise.
"We're starting from a rise of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, while the number will be closer to the 2 cent.
Ampel on Durable Red: Watch on Waiting Time
Sometimes an ample simply doesn't get green.
The contact shaft in the street does not react, or the light sign is defect.
What are you going to do with red?
If a person has waited for a red ample long enough and the crossing is free, he can continue, says Stuttgart’s attorney Ralf Becker in the magazine “Motorrad”.
However, the waiting time must be "adequate", which can be interpreted differently by case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before exiting from a disruption of the ample.
Anyone who continues to ride despite the roots, however, must be clear that he bears full guilt for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who endures less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the ample after about three minutes of continuous redness and had to be responsible for a cruel red light breach.
The ample was not defect, but jumped a little later on to green.
A ban on driving remained saved because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Municipal Council is happy with a solid budget
Whenever it comes to budget meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipal shell in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has no longer known debt since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be booked as a full success in this sense.
This was clear in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around €7.6 million was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about €1.8 million over the approach.
It is due primarily to the excess of higher commercial income taxes and the municipal share of income taxes.
The asset budget was also significantly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned €1.5 million, he amounted to €2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially at the higher introduction from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
Since less investments have been made in the 2012 financial year than planned, the refund reduction has also decreased.
In total, the total reserve could be increased by around €2.1 million to €4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
“A work like this isn’t just shit out of the sleeve,” Gerster praised, looking at the annual account.
He and the council of the community were very happy about the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but exactly these good numbers could soon be expensive to the citizens.
Thanks to the good financial situation, the community in the past was able to give up high charges.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have been shortened more often.
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various compensation pieces.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities must apply for subsidies to provide certain subsidies.
"We need to look at the subject of alignment as investments will occur in the coming years for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster said.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in Chor for 60 years
With 60 years of age as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing association Cécilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter was on the scene, as usual, in the colors of his men's singing comrade.
Even after 60 years, singing makes him more than a lovely choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and his trust, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral referee in the name of the Cécilien Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him - as the Chor is also a church nurse - a document of the Alliance and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His colleagues submitted to him the documentation of the German Chor Association as well as a gravified zinnteller.
In addition to honour, the 31st autumn festival was held in usual tracks: with the MGV Betra, the Songkranz Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music association, the full-coloring were loaded with a colourful mixture of different hearings and singing styles that held the visitors around 400.
The MGV opens full maring with humorous songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Music, their brothers".
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared her to honour another small stick - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundesslied".
The men's song association Betra also sang classical choir songs such as "Jagerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Witch, far" by Hubert Goisern, as well as the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
The singer kranz saltstetten provided with his mixed chore and his women's group - the "impulsor" - for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed chore captured with the Napolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impushor" also captured foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Bierlied" in domestic fields, where the full-malerian music association offered the crowning musical finish.
For the children there was a small secondary program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer led a casperl theatre and read a few stories that the children worked well about lunch.
Children's dreams become true
Children's gardens and children's day places in the customs court receive post these days.
The Black Forest Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to assist the facilities in realizing their construction and decoration wishes.
Does the childhood need a new sandbox?
Participation in the action can include all children's gardens, children's dayplaces and children's clips from the whole customs semi-circuit.
If you have a construction or decoration desire for your design, you can apply for this in the black forest.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten building.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire to be realized with construction material worth up to EUR 2000 and one (action) day.
In addition, the winner must take care of many floating builders.
What about the Day of Action and the Helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the customs storage box.
It will be delivered to the children's gardens on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
The Kenyan press is accused of controversial media law
"We are in a terrifying situation and we can ask ourselves: what does Parliament stop tomorrow from simply eliminating the judicial independence?", the newspaper reads, which considers the draft legislation unconstitutional.
“The law is draconic and very criminal and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenias’ most regarded independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media court will “always be preconceived because it is a prolonged arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government takes the new law “the media effectively into a dignity attack.” On the contrary, the standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered “a severe strike”, and entitled the draft as “draconic”.
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Center in September.
The Kenyan media threw anger on the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units sent to the site were allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to interrogation with the order of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the charge was withdrawn after a shout of the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be punished with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation.
The Court also has the right to seize the property of the affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “a single punishment can put most radio broadcasters into the bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on their description according to Kenias’ “living blogosphere”.
If they call the media to silence, politicians could do whatever they want without punishment.
“No one will ever experience it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“When politicians leave themselves, they lead the country into the bankruptcy and return to us to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
In the past, the Kenyan lawmakers have raised public concerns.
In May, they voted to renounce the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and put their delicate wages of about 532,000 shillings free of tax per month – they are one of the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
At the importance of the city and the football club, the official invasion celebration for the art race sports square did not include anything despite the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant celebration was probably all wanted last Saturday, but Peter didn’t want to play with them.
So all those who came without a rainbow or couldn’t hold that for any reason.
That’s what happened to the musicians who framed the festive act, as did some speakers.
Wets was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream.
His gratitude to all, Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly engaged in the implementation of the project, was considered to the Municipal Council, the companies involved and the members of the association.
Here are lothar hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rushing retirees moved 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honourable commitment also honoured the Landing Member Karl Rombach.
Additional greetings were spoken to the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the District Chairman of the South Badia Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded that repeated weather-related influences in the spring and autumn included the original herb square so that he could not be played.
Fifteen years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when it was intended to build a third place at the football club’s field or at the Real School at the Salina Lake.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts on the establishment of an art race sports place, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken two years ago when the FC took over the Shebal level in heritage, earned a cost contribution of €100,000 for the construction of the square, and the country approved aid of €1040,000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining €356,000 at the total cost of €560,000 together.
The beginning of the 68-time 108-meter-sized art-race square took place on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were deducted, half of which were used to build a dirt bike trail.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with internal and judicial issues.
To do this, the working group gathered in the morning in Berlin.
There is also direct democracy, deputy defence and federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group of Migration and Integration wanted to continue its consultations.
There is, among other things, dual citizenship, where both sides have contradictory ideas.
The SPD wants the force for immigrant children born in Germany to decide to end - the Union refuses a double passport.
With regard to the issue of traffic, which is not on the agenda on Friday, the SPD undermined its no to one of the CSU's truck measures.
A vignette is a “flat rate for diversity and thus ecologically counterproductive,” the SPD negotiating leader on traffic, Florian Pronold, said in a letter to his group.
There have been a threat to road traffic, which are already an accidental point.
The introduction of a meat for all cars would also be a first step in view of Pronolds.
“There is the risk that compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later time,” he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing fohnwave on the open light scene
Stuttgart - "When will the summer be right again?" was actually not the question on Friday evening on the freelicht scene Killesberg.
It was a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Car driver seriously injured in an accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old driver from aachen has been seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old was on his car on the Kempener outer ring towards Grefrath at 21.15 p.m.
When she wanted to go to St. Tuniser Street to the left, she crossed the 37-year-old car.
The riders collapsed.

Constance: blocking after an accident on the candlestick
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibizas on Thursday night, at 20 p.m., on the left trail of the two-spurious Reichenaustraße went downtown.
Shortly before the circular traffic at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left sabbie track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and moved to the right track.
This was a collision with the BMW driving there of a 23-year-old Constanzer.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged.
A total of about 15,000 Sachs injuries occurred, police reported.
The road had to be shut down during the accident recording, it continued.
Vienna Airport creates passenger benefits
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will no longer be such browsings at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the speaker’s prosecutions fall away - the noise level should be so significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, the airport of Vienna follows an international trend with the setting of passages relating to individuals.
As such, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoned to the noise calls.
With the disappearance of these passages - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers on a day - it is expected to be more calm at the airport in the future.
"In the experience, it has also been shown that these individual passages have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changing departure or departure time is going to pass a bit here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio broadcaster.
Highlander Games at the Coldenhof
In addition to the brake car with tractors, there is another second competition on the cold court in the agricultural autumn festival from 6th to 8th September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 13.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they have been sharpened in the cold courtyard.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of wooden tribes, iron tribes, and water heaters.
Four-and-a-half meters the tree tree is long and 25 to 30 kg heavy.
“It doesn’t matter much,” says organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be thrown down straight, it must once overflow and then come to bed.
This is evaluated with most points.
When you throw iron, it comes to target accuracy.
From eight meters of distance, a pflock is thrown.
Skills and strength must prove to the participants when carrying water more than 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two will then be allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive awards.
You can be trained from 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can join the Scottish rock.
It is also permitted to carry shortages.
For "Outfit" the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can login up to an hour before the start of the match.
With the Scottish-Shib Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts a half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been highlighted on the fixed ground on Saturday.
In the evening, the music freaks come at their expense.
At 19 p.m., Schömberg’s bira-bohemical blasmistic music forms the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays beautiful Polka and marsh.
However, their repertoire includes sensitive walzers and a satter big band sound.
With it will be the singer host and blackwurstbaron known as Heinz Koch from sometimes among the rines.
In Dornhan, he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the foolzunft.
On Sunday, the music association holds Leinstetten to the early stages, from 14 p.m. the farmer chapel Böffingen to guests, and the "Olds" then leave the festival out.
On Friday the stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf.
Other program points include the Oldtimer and Schlepper meetings on Saturday and Sunday, exhibits from companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the Handcrafter Market and the Shepherd.
Especially for children there is a strip zoo, Strohhüpfburg, tractor ride (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the multi-purpose fundraising association, the ski club and the tractor friendly "inflammatory capselles".
Milk and egg alternatives in overview
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plants are, for example, a quartz replacement.
The Vegetarian Federation is called the World Vegan Day on November 1.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives at the occasion of the World Vegan Day on November 1st:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, allow yogurt to be replaced by soya yogurt.
Rather than milk, soya, hafer, mantle or rice may be used.
Removalable plants are replaced by conventional strikes.
There are also plant alternatives for eggs.
For example, a half broken, mature bananas can replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake.
Also, 50 grams of apple or one teaspoon dishes of lean seed plus three teaspoons of water are suitable for it.
Lockers become teige instead of eggs, for example, a mixture of a tea cup of baking powder, a tablespoon of food thickness and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soja yogurt or seidentofu can achieve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 vegans are now feeding in Germany, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American Grand City of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it just went to Brooklyn Bridge, which was reached by foot the heart of the city, Manhattan.
It has already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous Skyline, which makes a special rise in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithfully the motto "The City does not sleep" was decided on the day at Times Square.
Despite shutdown, the second day, the status of freedom could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went through the financial center around the Wall Street to the Memorial of September 11.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373 meters high Empire State Building’s viewplatform.
Then it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, offering an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students are now arriving in their host families and experienced the day of school at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name day of St. Hubertus in the Pfarrkirche St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße, a hubertus fair will be celebrated.
St. Hubertus was a fairly negligible hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Lüttich.
The Hunting Horn Blazer group of Westfalen triggers under the leadership of Brigitte Kluth sings on Parforce Horns (natural Horns in the mood Es) according to old, original French melodies.
The blazers wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses, and hunters on slipping hunts musically.
The feast will be held on Sunday, November 3, at 11:30 p.m.
The newly designed bottle is shining with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
Dejà Vu, according to Lexikon, is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation once.
In the case of a visit to the same-named cafe at the opslag in the district town of Kleve in Vichtviite to the Rhein-Waal College, there is no need to stay at the clean Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the cafe with the beautiful name is exactly the purpose of making a real stay not only thoughtful, but also hand-feeding always revivalable.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
Looking into the inner life at the top 8 gives the viewer a good sense of anxiety.
The high-modern, but not cool cafe environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with various coffee or cocktail options.
To do this, there are delicious cakes or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before the opening of the jewelry cafe at the opschlag as gastronomers: in Kranenburg they conducted the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the uptake, the sympathetic cafe lovers are waiting for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"When we don't have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner stressed.
Instead, the two young students here want to respond as well as seniors and all age classes.
About the cafe-love.
The sympathetic owner’s pair is behind the coffee genre.
Enjoy the fragrant hot grain in the various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the Cappuccino drinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," the NRZ told her.
There were two events in the bright cafe.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Good, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's case.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is also not a pronounced fan of event ends: “You can’t even do it right now.”
And with an event I always talk about only those who are interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
Dejà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the storage in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy milestone.
To the joy of many clevers, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomy and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Thanksgiving Day at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Party to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were pleased to come.
At the meeting of the hotel "Witteborg" in Denker, everyone enjoyed the harmonic relationship with each other completely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festivity to celebrate honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award "Songers of the Year".
“You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also turned a few rounds for us, our heartfelt thank you,” said the chairman of the Chore Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participating in the performances and chor samples through activities were attended by the chor leader Dieter Schulze this year with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert himself, and the last year's "Songwriter of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Place five covered notenwart Artur Brückner.
A special thanksgiving, the board addressed the team of association host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had captured a menu of extra class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets his regular chor samples on Tuesday at 19.45 a.m. in the local association.
“New song-free voices are welcome at any time,” Schlotmann said.
UN announces new goals in combating poverty
The United Nations begins immediately with the development of a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago for the fight against poverty.
In front of the UN Summit for Sustainable Development, which started in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in leading the “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit at the evening that the time was coming to "think beyond the national interests".
“I am delighted that the Member States have agreed to take an attack process with which to be agreed on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and constitute an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will not strive to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the achievement of the Millennium goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden hasn’t won for four days, the handball overlist continues to have a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon has no doubts at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated in this matter.
However, I hope we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reserve hasn't had any trees out of Fredenbeck at the moment, Malmon has warned the display finger in advance.
I have trained a lot of players in the A youth.
This is why they will be very motivated against their ex coach.
"Therefore, it is necessary to wait if there is still reinforcement from the first," the SG-coach explains.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team has to rise in comparison to the previous performances.
First of all, in the covering work and in the game of switching, it was very important.
Chance revaluation must also be improved.
So I hope my players will finally get their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos with the eyewitnesses of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to match peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment firm.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business dress against a T-shirt entitled “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the Independence Square of the capital.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which are one of the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, which was initially supported by Rhodesia governed by whites and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but the recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy, a lot is in the game because the discovery of huge gas funds before the coast and coal warehouses in the northwest could bring more than $50 billion investments from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The governing Frelimo party, since 1975, the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government has provoked the recent conflicts by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the collapse and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself “a loser” who “will engage all of his remaining forces to prove that he can force the government to make his decisions.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo has resigned the 1992 peace agreement.
Against FT, he stated that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again and that’s serious,” Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the parties have only little contributed to resolving the tensions that have been inflicted by a number of collisions this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are assembling the heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, professor at the Open University and Mozambique experts.
No one is good in negotiations, and no one is willing to make the necessary consents.
Renamo, who urges election reforms, has already stated that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as a attempt to trigger consents and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos elections have collapsed since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – its resignation when its second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the president’s office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear which capacities Renamo has, but it has undertaken an alarming attack on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but Beira is located in the port, using mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded constantly to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people are already concerned about corruption, the sharp progress in development and a recent deployment wave.
“People think the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useable streets again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “previews of life,” says a writer.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and Artus’ legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “too wild, too anxiety, and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools,” so Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “careful selection” of age-right works.
“I think it’s wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that for authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic” children would “completely disconnect” because in fun stories the messages would be “disturbed”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angelic language and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplifyed or lead to the Happy End, but there is an imminent sense of good and evil.
This must be subtlely represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob returns to Freihof
Hundred years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took his age seat in Haslach, and his last years were alive in the "Freedom" on Sunday.
The many viewers were enthusiastic about the extremely short stage game.
From the arrival of honorary citizenship to his death, the script author and Hansjacob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a fun piece that had received a lot of help under the direction of Cornelia People.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker with the ten different scenes, explained connections and overwhelming times from youth to upcoming retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hans-Jakob returns home to his children's heaven, to his free cemetery.
And then the stage game began, where Alois Krafczyk once more shine in his paraderolle as a large son of the city.
He served with the two-spin and "black forest fixes" by Erich Becherer of Mühlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood incredibly well to enter the role of her sister and confess her in mymik and the gist of unfortunate life.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher farmer chapel played appropriately selected music pieces and thus rounded the performance.
To grant the honour of citizenship then Haslach’s mayor Heinz Winkler received the honour, who, in representation of the then official owner’s Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his intentions.
Their expectation then made the three-King singers who invited Hansjacob to the call: "Oh how beautiful, then youth memories of my own three-King period will be alive again."
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoy the audience at the freehof as well as the Storchendag children with their loud "out, out".
His criticism at the office church at that time, Hansjakob, had expressed the same concerns as his concerns about the expansions in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homefield, behind his tomb chapel at the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A quiet spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home forever," he said at the end of the scene.
Many applause and many praised words were from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: Neckar Giants’ Hope Grows
The chances for the remaining league of the sportsly rising Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
For if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Basketball Project Hamburg Towers resigns from an application for a possible retreat.
“We will not participate in the Wildcard process,” said former national player Pascal Roller, who since 2012 created the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt.
However, a first breath was not understood from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't work with the Wildcard procedure so long that Düsseldorf didn't get a license," Neckar gigantic boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
As of May 23th, upstairs Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the court of arbitration and demonstrate its economic federal league standing.
To date, however, the license has been rejected twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Dinner church rises to the point of view
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s Cultural and Tourism Office devotes the last of its this year’s public themes on Sunday, October 27th, the dinner church.
After visiting the Nuclear Keller Museum, the Haigerloch is to be seen after 1850 as the Haigerloch came under the Prussian rule.
The final point is to visit the dinner church.
There the leaders will tell the story of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in one through and through a Catholic area.
The church also looks at the dinner painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an originally loyal reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the other half-hour leadership is at 15 p.m. at the Nuclear Keller Museum.
Maps are available at the case of the Nuclear Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former U.S. secretary expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. sphere.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor-General may either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, referring to non-nearly named circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question can be clarified intergovernmentally, he said.
A departure of Snowdens from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency cited its source.
Because Germany is US allies, Snowden threatened the delivery there, it continued.
Long breathing is paid
Six men's teams fought at the Association's tennis tournament for the winner title.
Finally, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friendly Rohrdorf to the tournament of local associations and friends.
The fun in the tennis games was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plane, each playing against each.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the crucial phase.
The favourites of Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were equal to Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG tubeweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
During the victory, Carmen Müller finally passed the walker cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target line.
The second place was double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze stairs reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team asphaltriecher.
At the late afternoon sun and coffee and cakes, the successful outbreak of the tournament took place.
Last August week, the Schwarzwald Freilicht Museum Vogts Farmhof in Gutach at Hornberg was re-established in children's hand.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful child and family party with numerous participations and events.
"Group and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release said.
Whether making soap, turning candles, filling or sealing, it is suitable for any age.
The children are helping regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 17 p.m..
The museum workshop also works.
When building cucumber pipes, water wheels or circles, young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as racing carriage or steering racing.
Speed and coordination are asked here.
For all small detectives, the museum offers a mystery guide through the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, each at 12 and 14 pm.
On a landscape, children need to find out what stories of truth correspond or are lied.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to meet the outdoor museum during a cutting-edge ride with black forests.
Not only horses, but also many other animals like sheep, cattle, cows, and goats are to be found on the ground and to be amazed.
In addition, all children can be delighted at the Clown Otsch on Sundays, which runs his shabernack with the museum guests from 11 p.m.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is comfortable and marvellous.
The storyteller takes the small guests to the wonderful world of the march at 11am, 13am and 15am.
In addition, the Gutach children’s dance group performs traditional dances at 11.30 p.m.
In addition, on both events days from 11 a.m. to 17 p.m., many craftsmen such as the binder, the closest girl, the spinner, the weberin and the beckerin can look over the shoulders in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum are waiting for a variety of holiday programs.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a loving-kind Kauz because he committed himself to participate in a race in America with his motorcycle, 1920’s construction year.
Burt, despite a heart failure, is not to take away his dream.
With his savings, a pair of donations and a mortgage on his old workshops, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly in the country.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships into the holding.
The company has several irons in fire at the location.
In addition to coal import, Rhenus Midgard puts, among other things, on wine plant logistics.
Black shine the stone coal on the warehouse in front of the deck.
Two giant blue shelter and recharge equipment are distributed or loading the coal here as needed.
Whenever the switching equipment moves, a shrill warning exchange flows over the ground.
“The signals serve security and are legally required,” says Matthias Schrell, CEO of Rhenus Midgard at Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the unfavourable wind it is far-reaching - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and therefore has contacted the affected, the 40-year-old says.
In close agreement with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals more quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he will also focus on the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Matthias Schrell has a few more in front of the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Axis Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to put coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 metres deepened shaped terminal, the Capesize Bullcarriage can also be completed here for a long time.
“This year, we want to break the 3 million tons brand at the turnout,” said Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, import coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant continues to go to the network, about 5 million tons of coal imports are realistic per year.
The three ship discharges on the bridge as well as the second transport belt could create up to 10 million.
Basketball players in Bayern despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euro League couldn’t defeat the huge optimism with the Basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can prohibit us from believing even against the best team in Europe in the last two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic balanced after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich as well!
At their only third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but they were simply not clear enough in the crucial stages.
First, the guests managed to turn the art piece into a 15-point backdrop 13 minutes before the end, even before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We've been back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made a slight mistake again," Bayer's professional Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful hunters of Munich who celebrated significant victory in the first two parties against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, Variety Artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference at the Broadway Palace Theatre, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays’ innovation has been expanded, as was last at the New York Comedy Festival.
Initiated and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up Carolines Institute, the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were sometime too familiar to appear in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event takes place with Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as with “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become familiar with rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became acquainted with a Sitcom on cable TV (the ironically slipped fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation in both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, rassen-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a renowned television and film director as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in Larry’s comedy DNA of all work,” Steinberg said.
He told me if he was here, then he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose my whole money, then I may live here."
Iran is satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran appears a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we have now had an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences in the last years," said Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
Although it would be a long way yet, the nuclear dealer is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will finally come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Commitments with Machete
Two children in Uruguay have been murdered by a 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunt with them.
With Macheten and knives armed, they shot the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a fountain, the El País newspaper reported on Thursday.
Then they had played football in front of their apartments in a working quarter.
The body was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young man who had taken them should say that she was sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the tattery before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys gave the intentional killing of the eleven-year-old.
As a reason, the elder named, among other things, a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily introduced to a psychiatric youth institution.
The holder must go to jail
Due to abuse of human trafficking, retaliation, threats, abuse, and dangerous body injury, the court of the land constantly condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three-and-a-half years in prison.
The former federal army soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two interventions in Afghanistan, gave a confession in a process talk.
According to him, in five cases he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the strip after a few weeks against his will.
He resisted with violence and threats.
The women’s revenue that had been made for him for years remained in custody.
By confiscating mobiles and SIM cards, he connects women’s contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who transmitted the women, he brought them to various Bordeaux in the southwest.
There he kept them in part to control their revenue.
The accused first claimed he suffered from a serious trauma after his colleagues died in an explosion next to him in Afghanistan.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a limited liability, the 33-year-old gave a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to understand the damaged women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four more cases of exploitation of human trafficking were detected, according to a first announcement by telephone surveillance measures.
The hearings have been characterized by high aggression.
In later meetings, the damaged had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body, has not made any statement to date.
It’s a “completely broken personality” that the violence and exploitation in this meet consider normal.
The accused regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He's gone out of these circles and wants to live a whole normal life after the jail," he said.
Oil price continues to increase up to USD 96 per barrel
The oil price also continued to decline on Friday after concerns over a high supply exceeded a report that China’s hungry energy production sector is growing.
The reference pipeline for delivery in December fell at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in late morning in Europe.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, meaning a price drop of 5.8% in October.
The large oil supply has loaded prices over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Energy Ministry announced Wednesday that the U.S. offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand by two reports of an activity growth in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continuing recovery in China's economy, whose growth increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it was at the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international raw oil, also used by U.S. refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London from 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
The court blocks decision on the NYPD's stop-and-free directive
A federal court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-fresh program (“Stop and Check”) of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal stated that Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until a city appeal was decided.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the constitution in the way that the program for the arrest and interrogation of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered corrective measures, including the decision to establish a supervisory body to assist the police in amending its directive and the corresponding training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requesting suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case as she infringed the Code of Conduct for American judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyity; this was partially justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had judged that police officers had violated the rights of tens of thousands of people because they had unreasonably targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fresh program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and organized a pilot program with cameras carried on the body in neighbourhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York stated ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were re-released after a police check.
An oral negotiation on the calling of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-fresh tactic has been criticized by a series of civil rights defenders.
This kind of controls have been in different forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded during the office of Mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased to a full-time level of 684,330 in 2011, most of which black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who listened to all the minorities filed a complaint that evolved into a collection complaint.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk program say that changes will end unfair practices and create more trustworthy and more effective police, as well as influence the way other police officers use the regime.
Opponents are of the view that the changes would push up the morals of the police, but not the criminality; also would waste money and the wider problem of a police, which has been under pressure after the destruction of thousands of jobs in the past decade.
The judge noted that it did not end the stop-and-fresh practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD’s controls were implemented.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels succeed
With this Beduin whiteness, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Semi-Hand".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have significant success.
The first President Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauretanian in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on-site on several trips.
During the talks, pictures of the interventions were shown on a large lens wall, so the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned actions.
The company’s desert vehicle was also shown.
This is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made a proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to act at the association in advisory function.
In 2008, the roomei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital station in Socogim, a Elends district on the edge of the capital, for honor.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be removed in Nagold.
You can learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, as Henne, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political disturbances in the country, you could not make as many travels as you planned, but many doctors came to Germany to stay here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medicines, association material, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied rich local colors by telling about Mercedes vehicles rebuilt from Mauritania to mobile chicken number and painting the experiences of the family-run musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritania journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of accounting as a young deputy.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
Gran Canaria is not far from Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Previous news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson claimed to use “Telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation” in the attempt to confirm a wrong tip about an affair by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court, News of the World heard a fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attracting special counselor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and followed her, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the emergencyW, is nobody who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch them in fresh action, but one who is confronted with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three methods to investigate stories investigatively: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disputes that, but we say, "And if he knew it."
Clarkes’ stories about a business were first captured by the feature editing of NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the investigation, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Pawlby, in which they were asked for information about them, Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story we want to put out tomorrow that I like to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The oaths heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced an affair with a married woman when he was associated with the mitang accused Rebekah Brooks who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks strive to hack telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
As a protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually take the first strike since 1972.
A conspiracy meeting ends without results.
In the conflict about the wealthy tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a sackgase after a missing summit.
President François Hollande welcomed the Paris Élysée-Palace Association and joined their complaints on Thursday.
However, he refused to dismiss the football from the planned 75 percent tax on revenue of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years since 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced at the end of November is now going to be carried out, Jean-Pierre Louvel, Chairman of the Professional Club Association (UCPF), said.
The gamedays set in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 fall.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to include the residents early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the civic information event on the flood water protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures to ask questions, to express concerns, and to raise ideas.
Heußler explained: “The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council.”
The flood, which was unprepared in Gechingen on May 15, 2009, was an incredible event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, says Häußler.
A river area study was assigned with the neighbouring community Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-in lands as possible is the goal," said Häusler.
Based on the planning of protection from a German weather service is statistically expected every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% increase.
In specialist circles, this is called "HQ 100aClima".
The water mass that caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,” Heußler said.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, it is necessary to invest around four million euros in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting some 70 percent of national subsidies.
Heußler, however, pointed out that the promotion is only if an overall concept is implemented.
The community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A delayed planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, 2016 can begin implementing.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the Municipal Council last week (we reported) provides local measures in the flow of the Irm fluid from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants used the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no noises and reservoirs are no longer planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, the most economical solution, Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Anxiety was ruined by altorts, who, even in normal weather rains, suffered repeatedly under a overload of the canal chain.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
Heußler noted, however, that the directives for channel systems are different than for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be forced.
To dimension the wastewater channels larger would melt millions.
Heavily injured after collision
On early Friday afternoon, two car drivers were seriously injured on the Landsstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but couldn’t tell about the accident at first.
However, there are several witnesses that should be evaluated.
The 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both cars collapsed together, the woman was so severely climbed that the firefighter took nearly half an hour to get rid of the car wrack.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both disasters arrived in nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a god-seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have some series.
Amazed the parenthood in the outermost: the stubborn eyes, the bart, the high fronts.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski understands with his massive work as the founder and Apologue of the Russian soul, you read Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is regarded as a whole in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne Edition, which has distributed Haffman's cassette with the 118 stories in two thousand.
Dick explains America - the empire of amazing technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security and faith, chosen.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read as a mixture from the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He already realized that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Kill it.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" originated in 1956, it swells the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
Here the principle of "pre-criminal" is developed, "pre-criminal", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which looks like our terrifying, mutants look into the future - and the police strike.
“We collect individuals who have not violated any law,” the head of the Authority said.
"We catch them before they can commit violence."
And: "There are no serious crimes in our society, so we have a criminal camp full of pesudos crimes." They read time streams.
They assume that bad things are happening, and prevent criminal thought from being translated into action.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terror regulations and the NSA's hearing.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice work.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no division of power that the military controls everyday life – and what is left by the state.
Then the supervisor will be monitored by himself and transferred to a future crime.
The system runs through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
He invents his own conditions.
Take wrongdoers and sacrifices not only buying, but also building on them.
The system creates the danger that it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means repeatedly getting closer to the truth.
Speaking of Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. secretary expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. secretary office about German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Attorney could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia, the Interfax agency said.
Earlier, Green Day Member Hans-Christian Ströbele had met as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police hubschrauber flew deeply over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), of the German Homeland Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. foreign office, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States did not use foreign spying opportunities “to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became Whistleblower, has started publishing his full horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director to the word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new level of state surveillance.
The fasc to pass led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was confused, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to see, business managers are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany has to wake up,” said Oliver Green, president of BITMI, representing the small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. is now at almost the same risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and data stealing, a survey published in July by the EY consultant company.
However, there was no evidence in Snowden’s documentation so far that the United States had transferred the secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce their dependence on the United States.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag, it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This does not work,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you wouldn’t have been allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, up to the IT industry.
However, the scope and technical refinement of the U.S. spy authorities discovered by the Snowden revelations shocked companies that had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
Cloud Computing is taking place in a major change because European business managers are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to the legal practice there and are therefore potentially threatened.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, according to revelations about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of the U.S. non-member plans to use an U.S. provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s Deputy Executive Officer, says, “We see a new question from customers who haven’t existed a year ago – it’s: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these remain physically in this legal space?”
Many German corporate managers represent the view that the recent reports simply confirm just what they knew in any way, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be kept at any cost.
Economic spying is not a surprise.
It's always been that way.
“It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the BASF Chemical Company.
Americans are spying us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate management usually does not praise the contra-actions that have been taken, because this provides advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been confused that taking a free USB stick on a show or unprecedented seating a laptop in the hotel room is not recommended.
Ulrich Hackenberk, CEO of Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they can’t be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid handys when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid handys are thrown backwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain offensive to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns their own companies against economic spying by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate ranked behind China in February France, Russia and Israel ranked two of the countries that used to acquire economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German Blue Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spying, then “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Homeland Service DCRL, cited this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very carefully that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important discovery journey that man can do," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special exhibition in the domain in Hechingen.
They were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has resumed.
This begins with wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In front of the clothes are often greeted and with stickers closed, often with a slider, on the other hand, they go down the back and often end in a slider.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes, the spirits separate from the fashion house of clothing.
In men, the dress dominates with west and plastic, but there can also be a choice of cream or brown combinations.
It is important to choose the location, it was explained.
Non-Jewelry side rooms are not optimal, the atmosphere should be special.
Here the domain made attention to its own offer in the remise.
Anyone who wants to go with the kissing then has a offer for the Uwe Link.
"But kisses are also popular for young cell adoptions," he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more fashionable is the "After-Wedding Photo" - that is, series of recordings in special places, preferably such as waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding dress, said Elizabeth Keidel.
Many other details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding tables, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Don’t forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
Repeatedly, the athletes of the dog-friend Bitz were successful at a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his chicken Sandy, he achieved 94 points in the class beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month old Marley, he put it in place with 87 points in place twelve.
Susi Höpp met her Woody in class 1 with the critical views of the executive judge.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a collapsed ringmate in his high school gym are convinced that her son was killed, family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11, in a high-speed mate standing behind the tribin in the school hall.
The investigative officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old suspected.
"They are convinced that their son was killed," Benjamin Crump, lawyers of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They would never believe he was dead as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that every logic is clear, violate the laws of physics, as well as the healthy human mind,” Crump said.
Instead, they are convinced that the truth will be deceived to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school and returned to the body bag,” he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am convinced that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation,” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson was killed by the consequences of a “position-related crash”.
However, a second autopsy has resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he will be entrusted to the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all the surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publishes Allergic Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children at schools.
These are the first directives issued by the U.S. government as the number of schooling children with food allergy is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has an allergic to food.
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies with teachers and employees and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools store epinephrine – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The lawmakers in the state have recently changed the regulations so schools can keep epinephrine easier in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something pushes my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it” or “My tongue is crushed.”
Parents of intersexual children can choose "indefinite gender"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognized for children who were born with unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer awarded strict male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but they can indicate "undeterminated" or "undeterminated" on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they don’t have to make overreached decisions regarding operations for sexual allocation in newborns, and to fight the discrimination of intersexuals.
An intersexual person said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain the flipwork created by doctors, dirty and full of narrows.
Each year, one of 2,000 children are not born as a boy or as a girl.
They are one of the intersexuals, a group that is subject to the diagnosis of “sex differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes, chicken glands (ovries or hooks) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible, and not expecting the child’s psychological and physical development before deciding for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in gender identification issues, said that the new German law “was like a good thing.”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but that’s not true for most children,” he said.
You can take a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexuals are different from transgender or transgender because their status is not related to gender, but because of their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics have been shown in postgraduate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, haircut, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination that is exposed to intersexual and transgender persons in the professional life, as well as the extent of torture, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not agree with the gender image now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to specify on official documents male, female or ‘third gender’.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person after a court approved the maintenance of a "undeterminated" sex status.
German certificates, along with M and W, have a third allocation, X for intersexuals in the future, according to the Ministry of Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online website also pronounced against the German law, arguing: “If the world is wrecked into a new state where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we will disrupt two other pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to the baby zone that she found it better when babies are assigned to a gender at birth.
“The parenthood is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” the parent’s website said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female gender parts were described as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both gender.
Even ten years ago, medicine considered the gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are suspected, after now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors may also lie wrong because they don’t know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeons.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with unclear genitals returns to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who represented the view that the gender is formable.
He characterized the term “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental offences – as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized whether a person is considered male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known under the title "John/Joan" his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated by a distressing circumcision to castrial the child completely and also remove his hats and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he turned back to male and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the inclusion of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations have come to the public who are “unfortunate with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but two-declared genitals.
The doctors were unclear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfied life” as a man.
So his external organ and the hodes were removed surgically shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he explained to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he discovered was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and no one told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After he learned the truth, he turned back to male identity, received testosterone injections and allowed his breasts to remove.
Through the operation, he became infertil.
Today, he struggles for others in an organization called Interface Project to be perceived as normal by intersexuals.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of the California-based law group Advocates for Informed Choice, ensures that the German law can encourage "to vote and stigmatize".
“Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child a ‘not set’,” she said.
We are afraid that will favor interventions.
We think it would be better to assign male or female gender and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said its organization supported Australian law, because “it allows adults to recognize as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law relates to allocation at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
If they are adults, they can decide on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexually differentiated disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law is “representative” both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics due to the recipe order failure of target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee of child psychiatry.
Although she is unfruitable, she hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or hire mother.
“The law gives parents space, which does not have to make ruined decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them the time before they write "men" or "female".
This way everything is okay – you pull the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you don’t have to take over an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This involves children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are killing because they think they would not do the right,” she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girls by car shooting
Unknowns injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen arrest in shooting from a car.
The murderers probably fired a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin with air pressure weapon.
This was reported by the police in the castle.
The girl was easily injured on the left wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shooting came from a small car that was in front of a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Two witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The criminals also shot on a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove out of it.
The criminal police said it was on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called for two children who were eating, throwing them down against household facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the remains of the eggs equally, there may also be no Sachs injury.
In addition, some Sylvesterböllers may have been inflamed in the city area, but there is also no Sachs injury.
A resident of the Bishop-Freundorfer Road reported his car was wrapped in paper and his rabbits were removed.
However, until the police arrived, the man found his radzier blinds nearly all again, so the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes with public transportation.
"You hope you're not afraid of spins?" asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spin on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinning phobia, but the concern that the many steps to the house and in the apartment are no longer able to handle at age.
Also: Since a menopause surgery, the midfifth lady has had to experience on her own body, which means moving with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently, a book from her appeared on the subject 'Happy living in age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
“Our apartment is the best example of what’s not going on in the age,” she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at mid-50, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are dealing with the theme 'Woman in the Age' at all.
Most of them will endure it as long as it is.
“They’re always going to be the others,” she said.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really big, you think.
“Then it can be too late too,” Ries.
In its book, the interior architect presents 17 home models for a self-determined residence in the age.
“What type of residence you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
This is not a solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Britain should always think that he can also get sick.
And: ‘Without good knowledge of the country’s language, you can also agree in Dolce Vita,’ the author of the book gives residents to consider.
Their models include classical care models, alternative housing forms, or the frequently cited pensioner-WG.
At age, everybody has their own ticks and makeups.
"For me, there would be nothing like this," she said with a blind eye.
It's not like a student-WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
“At age you just need his retreat rooms,” Ries said.
However, that an elderly community can work, the book author does not want to exclude.
This should happen differently than in the classical students’ WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest, she believes.
With this view, at least she is not alone in the country’s capital.
"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they go," is the experience of Theresa Rütten, the leader of the civil service life in the age of the country's capital.
Their office advises people around the topic 'become older'.
That’s why, just elderly people would often also take in order to stay in their usual environment only, that’s also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment barrierless.
Ries recommends to all those who are engaged in the old-fashioned rebuilding of their home or their apartment to only be thoroughly informed and not assigned to the best craftsmen.
Today, there are also specialists for the old-fashioned reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment, let one or the other realize this, and if it is only the toilet seat rise, the interior architecture is clear.
However, the existing apartment can not always be converted rightly and therefore barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a staircase inside the apartment, which would also be a larger obstacle on the way to the door of the apartment.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it is more cruel than before the spine at the door of her apartment.
The United States wants Snowden to continue to criminalize
The U.S. has not changed its position as former U.S. secretary official Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of unlawfully transmitting secret information.
He has to make a criminal proceeding in the United States, said the spokeswoman of the U.S. Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Snowden’s recent statements wouldn’t change anything.
Previously, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States to not further threaten him with punishment after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow.
Psaki emphasized that Ströbel's statements were the ones of a parliamentary and not the ones of a German government member.
Secret Service Detective Edward Snowden is generally ready to talk to German authorities.
But first, he wants to clarify his situation.
This clarified the former U.S. NSA employee in a unadressed letter published by the Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed to the federal government, the Federal Day and the Federal Attorney General.
The writing has the following word after a translated by Strable:
To the competent
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
I called Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed as a direct technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
During my employment in these institutions, I became witness to systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me to act from moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent hit that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I now live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum that the Russian Federation gives me under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have found the revelations on a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not responsible for anybody as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefit for the society from these findings is increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken in purchase were clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat this as a breakdown of loyalty and seeks to criminalize and accuse political opinions.
To say the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that with the support of the international community the government of the United States will reject this deterrent position.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been raised, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for your efforts to maintain international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Children's garden found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen’s mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "adequate" price.
“The community is satisfied,” Maier said.
The budget was 100,000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the previous child garden.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has assigned the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, how to warm up, look after the garden and clean the walk.
“This effort is gone,” Mayer is happy.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The music association Hammereisenbach offers a concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When Bianca Willmann has the taktstock at 19:30, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammricher musicians.
President Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who helped manage the first musician hock successfully.
Report: Obama campaign plans to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The discovery is the most noticeable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long-awaited work on the 2012 election race, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is a copy of the book that will appear soon, and she reported on Thursday that the top advisers of the President had conducted “ample group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out whether it would look better for Obama’s delaying hope of re-election if he let Biden fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly depicts the history of the efforts of the campaign and the White House’s leading employees, notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of President’s closest advisors – including Daley, Obama’s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and former White House leader advisors, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the alleged change of information.
In "Double Down", Daley claimed to have been at the top of the efforts to exchange Biden despite their "near, personal relationships" before finally deciding against such a shake after the data showed that Clinton's candidate would "not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden by Clinton.
“I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
We need to remember that the president had a terrifying survey at that time, so we thought, “With God’s will, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigations as “command care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for the re-election, there were significant efforts to figure out whether such a train was paying for the elections.
“In campaigns, not much money will be spent on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley explained, he did not believe that the president was “conscious of the possible change,” the former staff chief admitted that it had been “possibly” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political surveys had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks that Obama knew nothing of the investigations about whether Biden should fall in the elections.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What happens on the way to my email?
Email is actually an electronic letter.
Was the letter secret technically implemented in the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to the conventional post?
In the conception of early Internet services, it was the priority to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account to create a stable foundation for a safe listening letter exchange.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postal card rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", the computers of the two are then directly connected?
The e-mail program or Anna’s browser sends the email to the mailing server of their service provider in the first step.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This email server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the email can run through some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will traditional emails be read through the network on their way?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the way.
At the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail conducts a malicious program as an annexed.
In the recipient systems, a virus check is also carried out.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a boring and unwanted spam email that is immediately deleted or at least deleted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also identifies the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday trips, Google may include corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood of non-authorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal ways to capture or take into account emails.
This will lead to possible illegal outsourcing actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to scatter the metadata of an email communication so that it cannot be recognized without any further information on who has communicated with.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google, according to a survey of Convios Consulting from August 2013, play only a subordinate role in the mainly privately used post offices.
While Yahoo’s shares were last falling, Google’s GMail could significantly increase.
Mother in the woods and retirees
When his older mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest, and continued to cast their pensions and care funds.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his deceased mother after police investigations in the forest.
He first sentenced the death of the 89-year-old, and then crushed the money for more than a half years.
The 67-year-old has to be responsible for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May: At that time, he found that no drugs were needed for the nursing mother.
The investigator told the retiree that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this happened to the officials, they further identified.
He found out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last taken care of them.
The 67-year-old finally died of his mother.
According to police, an obduction did not provide evidence for a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice that shines in the dark – using cuffs.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of sea animals and created a bright taste from it.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on curbs and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially make the shiny protein.
The ice cream reacts when consuming with the tongue, increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the meal reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – the more you tear, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH increases and the ice lights.
We have tested it in the last months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever produced, because the coal fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball cost me about £140.
But it tastes good for it.
Charlie’s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual taste directions, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, “I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is for and for itself impossible due to the light failure caused by the ice crystals, which consists of ice cream; but I suppose we find a way to create it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a calf made artificially by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six games.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts again for us.
"I hope we will finally have our head free," Ehlers behaves optimistically.
Finally, with the exception of Hendrik Blohme’s permanent injured, he has made available his full frame.
Daverden, as we do, also plays on pace.
Therefore, we have to keep our error rate low.
However, first of all, it is necessary to increase in the cover, which last left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a home number.
But that’s why we’re not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to start a series in Morsum.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
To do this, the A-Jugend Joost Windßuß, who is active at the A-Jugend Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates its seasonal coverage.
Whoever isn't hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had some magic.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay late and dressed for the neighbourhood.
Today I have become a Halloween muffin.
In the last two years I have not declared myself willing to divide from my apartment from sweets, and maybe I will not even do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep with regard to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. retail association (NRF).
One thing I am happy about every Halloween is the trends.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting unliving objects are the last shouting.
Women no longer have to hang in sexy clothes, they can now also include a fascinating meal such as pizza, hamburgers or cartoons.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Voltroommen will create it in the Instagram feed this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and weren’t alone.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As for sweets, we are not simply.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate, lutters, bonbons and rubber bears.
So good news for 41 million people, according to the U.S. Commerce Ministry, who draw through the neighbourhood with the speech “Soups or Saturns”.
In fact, we’re going to buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don’t expect – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugar candy corn; however, 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of sweeteners.
These are about nine billion corns.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than to houses in which it spucks.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized squadhouses in the United States that earn $500 million in revenue, so America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful pictures on which you just pink into your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you don’t get rid of them again, and then one of the guys you’re standing on, leave a comment like “netter face print.”
But let's finally get to the cowboys.
Charlie Brown made us acquainted with the big kidney when we were children, and cutting a kidney lamp is like the jewelry of the Christmas tree – something that we have made from a child.
Fortunately, the “Baby in the Curve” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up in cutting the curve and not sitting there.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on curves, the US Census Bureau said.
The curb lamps, which are slowly rotated in the pre-garten, are likely to come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of curbs were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut some beautiful from their 921 kg heavy cherry.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: rescue forces in the mountains sold body
The firefighter had to leave in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the Landkreis Hof captures fire in the night until Friday.
The rescue forces mount a sold body out of the house.
Rescue forces found a sold body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it's about a resident, it's still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday night it was burned at the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighter arrived, the flames already broke out of a window.
The attackers went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The entire floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unclear.
Germany’s largest country church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor.
The Evangelical Lutheran National Church of Hannover estimates that the number of pastors will now decrease by about 1,800 pastors after the current situation by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects,” said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day course itself.
With Burfien, the country church has for the first time ordered a pastor to enthusiast young people for theology.
Currently, less and less young people decide to study theology after the Abiture.
Burfien brings this back to the process of decreasing: “God’s voice is quiet, the world is loud.”
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my calendar and I can put my priorities where it is important for me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a soul career.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Surely more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This comes to meet young people from today, who are not just about career, but about a mindful work.
According to the National Church, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are retired per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In thin-seated coastal areas such as Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organize studies for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers extensive training.

Land Rover Rally Series
In the interior there are racing and six-point gates, as well as a free calling facility.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people looking for tension and adventure, as well as a way to world-class events.
We are delighted to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format provides new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare new ones for the straps and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Car – this will be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
A firearm called to rescue a chicken, fixed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous stone protrusion in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby escaped after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in a stone break in her misplaced location.
Firefighters sealed on rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The firefighter managed to secure a chicken that was fixed on a 15-meter-high front in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby escaped after a traffic accident on Sunday morning and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, who belonged to the dog, came to the stone break Flwest in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing kid and published aid calls on social networks when they had escaped after the small traffic accident in the rock.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the beached ruby on the 15-meter high level in the stone break.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station’s technical rescue team went to the place and sailed to rescue Rubys, which was then transported in a dog box upwards.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from top and floor.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like a rigid frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual effort.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a technical rescue team specialist, said, “Ruby had a huge luck.”
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian, but he found nothing except fatigue and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “To watch the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was really there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and it had broken together, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never did Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Jaggers' song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she ate with the altrocker in the evening, and that "he's stuck me when I was 18."
She added, "It's been a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a 70-year-old Hungers representative said on Thursday that he “categorically denied that he had ever made an approach to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on Anhieb at 1st place this week.
George Kerevan: European eradication gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secured border along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not play a role in the strikes.
Also, no one has mentioned that the EU Member States often comply with their strict rules if it is more favorable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, continuing non-observation for Brussels would be a small consent in return for what the Scots really want.
So, really, no story.
And one that has already come so in the years that it is already like a fossil: for the first time I heard the "independence means passport control" end at least 40 years ago.
One interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance according to the European Pipe?
Why does the London Joch change against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, which was drawn up after the war, has fallen into the ground.
With the euro crisis, the project has officially died in Europe.
All over the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party’s alternative to Germany – founded only this year – was able to take nearly five million votes at the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the rigorous savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is needed by holding the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to do.
Without the possibility of a revaluation of the local currency, South Europe will have a built-in productivity disadvantage to Germany.
The only way is to shorten wages and public expenditure – sponsored by Berlin.
Behind the current state and monetary problems is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a consequence of the “green” energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and for gas as compared to the United States.
This is a brilliant cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All the world’s salary records do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner from cheap American screw gas.
As a consequence, a rebellion rises, especially in France, the invasive cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that could keep Germany in shake and raise Paris with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gate to political legitimacy, and Europe has pushed its own economic policy to fight the French economy.
The result is that Marine Le Pens, the EU-winner Front National, has just won a decisive succession, thus referring to the third place of the governing socialists.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically provide benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French workers of the working class?
She wants to use EU elections next year to smuggle an anti-EU, anti-Community currencies block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut well in these elections – and this is very good possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go out: in a far-reaching future, the growing ressentiment against the EU and the common currency will meet together in order to abolite the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become as much as the “Europe of the (suverene) nations” that favoured General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold the euro fixed, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance from this project in the hope of entering the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific states that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland staying with all of them?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels to tell what they can get to where.
I suppose Scotland could run well in a more attractive European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against the savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and taken) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had been responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide on independence now, only to get a saving policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Being grown faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age co-workers, as research shows.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a cause of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less expressed in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and shame at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents – it’s usually not a sign that puberty is coming up quickly now,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axis hair, as well as body smell, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarchy (the appearance of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to the menopause,” Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Free puberty in girls: the essential advisor to deal with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is "previous" if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth sweat before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In faster advances, tests may be indicated by an endocronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods to delay early menstruation and defend another result: premature aging of bones, which ultimately can lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for a medication or hormonal therapy are oriented to the age of the child, the rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained with regard to drugs, but he admits: “The suppression of puberty can mild behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their agemates.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” a woman whose daughter has got her 10 days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came up anxious and excited from school home because she was the first in her friend’s circle.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no decisive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are essential.
Boys come like girls before in the puberty.
Kaplowitz is the most convincing assumption of the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine years, creating a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age co-workers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys are growing face and shampoo hair earlier, the trend to a full-time previous puberty is not as expressed as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is common even in babies and small children.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to advise their child physician how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to run a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
When you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need insurance, which is a normal part of life, even if they come in earlier than they thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute with large orders over seat width
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class in long-distance flights, indicating the sound for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seat width that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines most endeavour, but this designated space is the key to the affirmations of efficiency in the latest airplanes of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus demanded a industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute arises at a time since the airplane builders are betraying to sell even larger versions of their two-motor long-range aircraft, and expecting record contracts at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – particularly whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that will provide the new Mini Jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized “777X” has 406 people sitting in the tourist class, which is more than 17 inches wide and allow 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per series.
Airplane giants often share hips about technical details through advertising in the professional press.
Now Airbus calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war, and money donors showed an image sitting together in a restaurant, with the title "Will you accept it?"
“Boeing suggests long-distance flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props,” said Airbus dealer John Leahy.
Given changes in dietary habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average American male between 40 and 49 years of age increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Health Ministry.
The number of male average Americans in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says that his rivals followed a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body range of the freshly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
Airbus has conducted surveys that have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests the numbers of Airbus to the seat measure and says it is not to decide, at the discretion of the manufacturers, how airlines make the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really beyond giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they need to do to succeed,” Boeing’s air cabin expert Kent Craver explains.
They don’t want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it’s more free to be used, but for manufacturers, it’s becoming increasingly a subject that can affect the sales.
Behind the competition is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight for the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20% more efficiency per seat in their latest two-motor long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results are partly dependent on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than the machines used with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore seating more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, leader of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s, suggested that many passengers decided to arrange closer, which could be associated with cheaper airfares.
“Eight customs seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabinet expert, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-round jet salesmen even carry band measurement to measure the setting in the competition.
Even if they praise comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-decoration jets for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten seats, but has not sold yet, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more cabin adaptability and offers wide seats for some jets on the tracks.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation according to a new industry standard is likely to be distorted, but could distort the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garbage
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could destroy the fun in smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mouse from nicotine desire for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further attempts are needed, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hoping that this type of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who once tried to stop trying to try all the methods available on the market but had to experience that their nicotine desire is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information about the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant flow of antibodies.
Antibodies hunt nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker not to experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice to which nicotine was given contributed to their normal level of activity.
However, mice without vaccination would have taken a “excluding time,” the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine has reached their brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines missed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine lust.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“They know then: when they start to smoke again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to delete the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi contests being influenced by Obeid
Against former Laboratory Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation will be initiated by government corruption supervision.
The former NSW minister argues to have changed the arrangements for maritime packaging at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who possessed hidden shares of three lands in a state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) has expanded its investigations on Friday to question whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers on this matter, holding packet contracts at the Circular Quay, where Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe, without extending tender after its expiry in August 2005.
Now, due to the accusation, Tripodi knew Obeid's hidden interest in the plots, after Tripodi's former deputy staff chief Lynne Ashpole had said accordingly on Thursday.
In years of negotiations that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the pact contracts.
The peasants were against it and wanted longer.
In 2009, the package contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which imported the Obeide $2.5 million annually, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public tenders.
However, he refused to make changes to the requests of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed to a redesign of the government’s protective arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone records showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a chief official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Authority.
“Where is the issue discussed in these telephone conversations about the development of commercial packaging arrangements?” asked Vice Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft reach target in Syria, official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, a government official confirmed against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visa could be subjected to “truth test”
The government is considering a “truth test” for foreign workers with a visa of 457.
If the test should be introduced, it should be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the addition of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government debate proposal was published after the former Laboratory Party deputy Maxine McKew, who had condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers because they could be considered to be defended by Australian neighbours.
“Loud statements such as ‘outlanders should take back’ and ‘Australia should take back first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demand a protected labour market,” she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically considering that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region mention an echo of this historical artefact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal covers twelve measures previously discussed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who stayed yesterday in talks about human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes that others will still be considered.
If the “the truth criterion” is adopted, the person applying for a visa may be carefully verified whether the application is true in the cases where the applicant is related to the owner or relevant person of the supporting company.
Companies may also be required to account for the number of 457 visa owners after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally set up hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after he arrived on the Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia will be cared for since his father’s death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and Northern England, starting from Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train connection between London and West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building high-speed trails between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capabilities and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said, “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We go forward with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State, Alistair Carmichael, commented: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael urged him to "incomprehensiblely" engage in the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said, “The high-speed railway connection provides the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast railway connections across the UK.”
That is why we are delighted to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed train connection in Scotland, which creates the benefits for everyone and supplements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government already plans.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly taking the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain temporarily in force in Australia
Australian air passengers have to continue to disable tablets and smartphones when they start and land, despite efforts in the United States to lock the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read or play e-books during critical flight phases, see videos, provided they are in the “Flight Mode”.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed this, but many people are upset that they can’t read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the U.S. airlines to make a lot of work, but they do not follow direct plans to change their regulations.
The Aviation Safety Authority CASA also stated that you will consider the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
“The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” it was charged.
The subject is subject to provisions that ensure that airlines maintain the safety at any time and that passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by cabin personnel.
Virgin has already conducted conversations with CASA about a widespread use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explained that you are open to changes, but they should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said that you will remain in the current regulations until further.
“Our current policies provide that electronic devices cannot be used when starting and landing, and we don’t have any plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects American societies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, luggage programs and customer instructions.
“As a airline has confirmed its fleet’s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said.
In rare cases in poor vision, the crew will indicate the passengers while landing off the devices.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be shaved safely under the seat or in the seats.
Before the revierderby against Schalke, BVB adherents had served with light rackets for stunning scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost already aspiring acoustic that offered the viewer until the anpfiff of the Bundesliga game between German Vice Master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart at the Iduna Park Signal.
The guests were mostly listening to their songs.
The southern tribes, where the most loyal - and loud - fans of BVB, first presented themselves exceptionally quietly: no songs, no fighting calls.
The podest of the Capo, otherwise coordinating the joint fire, remained unemployed.
And in front of the tribune, a large flag entitled "Stadion Ban Section" was lonely.
Only as a gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, fired short-term jubilee.
When his crew colleagues followed, there was a loud singing and swinging shells - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribins there was nothing wrong.
Also, the stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again recorded the positive experiences of the last days – Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by trainer Jürgen Klopp – did not make a celebration.
Only five minutes before the anpfiff, the Capo crashed its podest – and the stretching tension, which was right by hand, relaxed in a loud shout when thickness as usual questioned the mood on the edges of the stadium.
Lastly, as usual, the southern tribins were on the line - and finally here was again, as usual, the most loud place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud invitation "Derby Victor stands up" came with Anpfiff from the South Tribune, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the associated BVB adherents had fired light rackets into the spectacle and on the spot - nearly doorguard Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the ultras from choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbid that,” he said.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in Pyrotechnology.
In addition, the ultrasonics have been displayed various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of next week.
"It's going to be cutting," said Watzke.
You can be excited about how the reactions to the southern tribins will occur.
Pfand houses boom in Singapore as the crisis arrived in the middle class
In a shopping mall at Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay their daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, where all my money is inside,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month (about 1.730 euros) as an administrative employee, and her husband also works, she does not rise up the monthly family income, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households increases – is so great that ValueMax, where she exchanged, has become the third pepper house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Beautiful jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, pandling houses in Singapore require an effective 17 percent annual interest rate, which is only nearly above 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank requires a local creditor with a branch at the same shopping mall.
Pfand houses, however, offer the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or income evidence, which is why loans are possible faster than in banks.
That’s why millions of people in the region are turning to pencil houses after families feel pressure due to increasing living costs, as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loud financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with smaller and medium-sized revenue are looking to make up the difference in a larger economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s growing domestic debt, mainly due to increasing mortgage, described as a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia compared to gross domestic product.
Malaysia stands at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, a 60 percent rise still in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a persistent export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that, given increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to complement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historical highest rates of gold prices in the last two years have increased the trend of sending personal items, as people use the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the flooded objects are in the 200 pink houses of the city’s gold state.
People say to themselves, “The gold price looks good, let’s find our grandmother’s gold chains and get back next month.”
The largest Thai pandhouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pand business is so strong that ValueMax, operators of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company funds it with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some borrowers have fallen into the cruise because of high interest rates, yes, they explain that pink houses not only bore cheaper interest than other borrowers, but also not directly increase debt.
“Customers possess items that they already own, and the fluid personal value items do not increase household education,” she explains.
The business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pencils are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to sell gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60% of the price of the bar.
Customers from every social layer come to us.
“This includes wealthy owners who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who have to overbridge cash flows,” Yes says.
Sometimes they just need very fast money.
NSA toss data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service unveiler Edward Snowden has a principle of interest in helping Germany understand the growing NSA spammers.
According to Mr. Hans-Christian Ströbele’s presentation, at his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about the conditions under which the former secretariat employee would say at a German prosecutor’s office or at an investigation committee.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government is based on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $325 million for the Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the government cannot waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to eliminate a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government negotiations with independent Tasmanian deputy Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has snored a emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges the state faces,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million emergency aid for election services.
With additional 2600 operations, including orthopedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, residues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care for stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that clinical employees have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister was a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must retain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds were spent.
A three-headed Commission is set up to ensure that the State provides health services as effective and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie stated today, the $325 million would only benefit little if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that lead the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable course.”
Regardless of this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to taking the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these elections will be implemented largely by the recent cuts.
But the spokesman of the opposition on federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is just a “flaster solution”.
“We are in the situation today because the Laboratory State Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a government runs nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth enters 300 million and then do as good news is.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, a monitoring group said.
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, the Global Monitoring Group for Chemical Weapons said Thursday, while in the north of the country there were heavy collisions near one of the locations where possibly toxic substances are stored.
On Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the Civil War almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date.
1 November, which the Hague-based organization had set up Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals to toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to begin with destroying the existing weapons and stocks.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, which include sulphur gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when fights took place in Safira on Thursday, according to experts, there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as the Syrian human rights observatory in the UK reported.
The group of activists tracking the number of dead via a network of activists in Syria said that 120,296 people died on Thursday.
Among them are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the sides of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the Army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hesbollah militia.
Among the deceased were 2,202 deserted military soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observer said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but no details were called.
The struggles underline the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, because their mission to release Syria from its toxic arms are a race against the time in the midst of a rough civil war.
According to the OPCW, which has worked closely with the United Nations, the team is “no longer convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced their destruction.”
Therefore, “there are currently no further inspection activities.”
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the inspections and visited 21 of the 23 places indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two locations were “released ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there were transferred to other entities that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
“I take the hut from the boldness and the courage that you have shown to complete the most challenging mission ever performed by this organization,” Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization, said in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years, the Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have struggled against Assad’s government and its security forces, which are many members of the Alawite, to divide Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Anger on judgment for Bali bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died at the bombing attack in Bali in 2002 were angry with the last of the defendants who had been prosecuted in court as Umar Patek was supposed to be shot.
Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most sought-after people on escape, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With punishment, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder due to the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
In addition, a prosecution was held in a series of terrorist-related charges, which included a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia at the Holy Night in 2000.
The prosecutor had requested a lifelong imprisonment, although it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, for his reputation as a master bomber, was also referred to as a "demolition man".
The decision has awakened painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who has lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the destruction caused by Patek and his companions nearly ten years ago.
With tears, she said that Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a shooting command,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I won't get any more grandchildren and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was similar to the ground floor, when a giant bomb exploded on October 12, 2002 shortly after 23 p.m. in a small laster parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had exploded an explosive-filled backpack.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack and "star" three times while hanging on a life maintenance system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and were sentenced four years ago.
Actually, this guy should get the death penalty first of all.
Leave him alive – no, there is no reason to let him alive.
It’s not much to get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers who stood before the court.
He was arrested almost a decade ago, but finally arrested in the city of Abbottabad in Pakistan in January 2011, where U.S. forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had reported that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuild the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
“He didn’t stand,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has not shown repentance for how much suffering he has added to others.
The judgment came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be many tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek may still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in planes (but they don’t run phone calls)
Flight travellers can now use their electronic devices from departure to landing to reading, working, playing, listening to music and watching movies, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines released on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented from the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline staff and the regulations for degradation of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the advanced use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must disable smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You can restart it only if the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and gives the captain green light.
At the arrival of the landing flight, the passengers must shut them off again and may not start again before the plane is landing.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the devices at the start, landing and on the roller field, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been re-equipped for the use of Wi-Fi at larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, Chairman of the Professional Airline Association, welcomed the amendments.
“When the new regulation is securely implemented – and we work closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
Sincerely, we're sorry to have to feel like a guardian on this subject.
However, Internet connections to browsing, exchange of emails, text messages or download of data within three kilometers remained prohibited, the Authority said.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet by American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the plane’s landing.
And heavier devices like laptops must still be understood, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight are also forbidden.
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may ban certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board, a security expert on national transport issues on CBS News, would still be considered a risk.
“Handy is really a problem not only because it could cause potential disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb broadcasters,” Rosenker said.
A consulting committee of the industry, launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government permits a wider use of personal electronic devices.
Over the past few years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to attract restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri have the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become widespread.
In some studies, the speech that forgets or ignores the disabled device to up to a third of the passengers.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not make electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a few years when the airline has reached its height.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices according to the new directives, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally give much less radio than previous generations.
E-Reader, for example, only emits minimal radiation when reflecting.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
One of the supports of locking restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company’s employees invited a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to detect problems but couldn’t find it.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd, from the National Association of Airline Passengers, said that the disturbance through the devices is true, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only simplified reports of pilots that talked about a disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to organize the disabled equipment by passengers in the case of instrument landing under poor vision conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
“We are delighted that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not contradict security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by the air conditioning service of Nordsee-Bohrin Island
A bird was found by air recreation service on the coast, exaggerated on a North Sea Bohrin Island, and was released into nature again.
The water rail was flying last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was accumulated by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water rail was probably a winter bird from North Europe held by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Looks like the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the Bohrin Island.
He added: “He couldn’t fly anymore, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
When they were released, the water rail was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK who provide prosperity and work want to change our relations with the EU.
For this purpose, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 managers from the economy that represent the UK corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprised by many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside of Europe and focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while the countries are stagnating in the EU.
They want from government to promote new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil instead of stopping with the long and striving process to reform obscure EU institutions.
Asked on certain legally regulated topics – from cartel law to product legislation – is the majority of economic leaders of their opinion that control over these key competences should be recovered to Westminster.
It was a general disagreement with the internal market, as the costs of Brussels regulations would now exceed the advantages of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the most traditionally European-friendly.
Finally, and this is most likely to say, our survey of economic leaders showed that a significant majority of the UK wishes a course towards change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, found in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pushing to a “sensitive change” that brings the burden of action back to the UK.
It is about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16 per cent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relationships from a new negotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and is increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a narrower economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows what is an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller by Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gasära
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom’s CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to ensure more diversity in Russia’s export routes across Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Pendants in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk of conventional routes, as is heard from official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are ‘excluded forever’.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to favourable rates when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way to cross the real estate in Germany.
The economic framework data vote, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate of the stock exchange schedule.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in comparison with Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa by Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out on the 9th day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
As German commercial real estate is looking for, look at the volume of transactions, Ulbrich said.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Immobile investments offer an attractive interest rate," Ulbrich said.
The return distance between real estate and federal debt is at a historically high level.

Consultation with the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused Jonathan Lord of sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been accused of sexual offences related to children before 2011 charges against Caringbah’s child career Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that “never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse in the organization”.
Director Phillip Hare was interrogated about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of crime in child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 was convicted of the abuse of children trusted to him.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assisting attorneys, that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second.
He added that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission was also uncertain in the allegation that “there have been external audits of the YMCA, in which the YMCA has been recognized as the leading front of child safety”.
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second most recent assessment of four possible in a quality audit from the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at YMCA at 21, said that the management has failed to “from me down” in setting up Lord and did not make sure that employees have been clear about their obligations to report violations of the Children’s Safety Guidelines.
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual offences.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, argues that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's breach of children's safety.
The employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, let her sit on her shoe, to one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose chief lord was and who had asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said Jacqui Barnat, who was the chief lords at YMCA Caringbah, was “very terrifying and most of the time was very unacceptable.”
The executive said he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have trusted to return to their head.
Instead, he said, instead, her friendship with Lord affected her ability to judge her, so they wouldn't have reported to him.
Hare explained that he informed the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to withdraw from the “Jonathan-Lord intercourse” concerns “not the report” by employees, and the Board has agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations were made by the director of the YMCA Children’s Services, Liam Whitley.
He said it should prevent contamination of the evidence, but that has been "overwhelming" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was busy there between 2009 and 2011, no child-safe organization, Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there were “severe problems” in setting up, reviewing, processing, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was delayed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance of returning as a British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his withdrawal from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his resignation as Head of State in June 2007, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself in British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as messengers of the Quartet of Peace Founders in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the prime minister’s office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse shower experts joined in Scharen in Cardiff to crash the horse of the year, they realized that a hard competition occurred.
But no one was prepared for the three-year old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who was not even in the childhood and had made his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee struck lockerly through the three rounds and took the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, was praised for their appearance, behavior and styles at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his tea shelves in a dirty angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony that is far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and toffee are a great span.”
They had to go up against the entire field of participants and left the place with gold cup and rosette.
It was the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Fully strangers in the Arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been leading horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electricity, and everyone fired it and shine it.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so small, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
As he started, it won’t take long until he’s on the horse of the year – and I’m sure he’s going to cut well.
One spokesman of the annual horse watch said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jury assessed Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented in the predecessor.
They were paying attention to good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton's sweet clothes helped her part, which really fits perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be “reformed” after calling
A Chinese newspaper on the title page that had requested the release of a reporter accused of diffamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later on television admitted that he had accepted funds to false reports about a party-state company.
Now the New Express is subject to a "complete rectification", the regulatory authority said.
The "Retification Order" came from the Bureau of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Interim investigations indicated that the New Express, which belonged to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several ineffective reports on the stock exchange noted company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express’s editing management was unarranged,” the regulatory authority said in a statement.
She said she had decided to "appoint an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license."
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been ordered to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant managers at the New Express and immediately check the leadership team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on public television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and its ability to gain the confidence of the public,” he said.
I did it first of all because I was out of money and reputation.
I realized I had been wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express issued an apology on the title page and stated that it was missed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently filed awards on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a law amendment at the beginning of the year in which authorities were forbidden to force someone to blame themselves.
Discovered drug tunnel with its own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug trafficking between the U.S. and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric train operation, was now discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel measuring 120 times 90 centimeters as one of the worst passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the Zickzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area, there are numerous unlikely warehouses, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized in it, the authorities said.
At the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who worked as a driver were accused of ownership and intentional sales of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences between 10 years and lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on an extensive underground network of discharge channels.
The tunnel is the eighth big passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the harvest of marijuana in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cardile the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with rail, which passed from a kitchen in a living house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actress Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for separation from his wife, topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or expect it."
Kerr and he still loved one another, the 36-year-old said.
“We will support each other and love each other as Flynn’s parents.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs significantly from this.
For while vegetarians allow to consume sand toasts, ice or a powerful eamer, these dishes are not on the vegan's food card.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the resignation of meat and fish, the vegan leaves the consumption of all animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but when you look closer, the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable inconvenience.
“Brothers are very popular,” explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the so-called reform house, providing a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, New Zealand's birthday vegan, in Lampertheim, he has found everything he needs to live. "I rebuild my diet in 1997 and became a vegetarian."
In the centuries, the next step took place, and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of nutrition, but because of the shoe selection," Proctor, the artistic leather, says.
He realized that it is also going in other daily interests without animal products.
First of all, being vegan is an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” Proctor exposes the maximum of vegans who are focusing on all consumer behavior.
Rather than retreating backwards from citizens, riders or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, increasing the enthusiasm.
“It’s a double bonus,” Proctor says today, “it’s not a vegan resignation, it’s no askees, but it’s an area.” The assumption that with the change of diet you can reduce the selection of food options is more likely to return to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditions also made some of the so well-meaning attempts fail.
“The digestive factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor compares.
And it says, "Special flavors are not to fix on the animal."
Often it is the juice or type of preparation that make the taste.
“But you can also create the same effect in other ways,” the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings to a barbecue party Aubergines, Champignons and a few vegan snacks.
He cares about a balanced, varied diet, with a delicate taste.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste, but it’s not just to reduce animal food,” Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the shift had a positive aspect.
I don’t take foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin percentage.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegans.
"My blood values are best, I often let myself check," Proctor says.
Especially before the lack of vitamin B12, many vegan critics warn.
“When animals are fed with foods instead of feeding on the grain, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cooler, the vitamin B12 is high,” Proctor says.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Proctor should not go a long way for food procurement.
Essential foods are available everywhere and every supermarket has soja milk and other products.
Everything I need is in place.
Sometimes I buy something special.
"Many people are surprised that just the finished products are expensive, but that's how it is known for "usual" finished products."
Without it, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-keeping than generally.
“There’s a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knives you can get good if you don’t get partially better results,” Proctor says.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and coal acid instead of eggs, with his vegan cheese cakes, Proctor could also bring his grandchildren to surprise.
The family party gives the vegans a new feast.
This has dynamics when cooking together, this has a new priority.
“The situations that can occur here are as different as people themselves,” Proctor says.
Of course, he has already been confronted with sceptics.
You don't taste my food anymore?
“Will I feel bad now because I drink milk?” – in such questions, you should act as a vegan with a fingertips feeling.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to terminate a slavery.
And, more accurately regarded, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are apples everywhere!
"Many shops offer favelas, or just a vegetarian yufka," Proctor says.
In a pizzary, he takes on pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slowly engaged in it.
"When I started feeding me vegan 13 years ago, everything was much harder," New Zealand can find an evolution: "You have to talk to people to make them aware of it."
"When enough demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as combustion in Mannheim or the Café Birdfree.
Proctor wishes other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the dining card.
In essence, vegan foods are available for everyone there.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes are exclusive, in the real sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor says.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the most part of the front impossible,” Proctor says.
Buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand that animal additives can also contain in earth nuts as colorants, it seems to be quickly abandoned by following the ethics in so many obstacles and falls.
Not only for this reason, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning.
“After and after, you develop a scanning view and know what characters and logos you have to pay attention to,” Proctor says.
Veganism, he is an important moral sign that hits the consciousness.
Perhaps he does not fully manage to keep his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The broker Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
Trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger panels at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, Nasdaq’s indexes were not calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August of this year, there were only two pans in a week.
First, the U.S. Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive incorrect purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
After that, the exchange operators took almost a whole day to check and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the United States came to reach for several hours due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
For watching, Facebook’s stock exchange was also provided last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established the stock exchange supervisory SEC and defeated the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Constance: Wheeler runs 63-year-olds
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, at 22 p.m., with a lady cycling irregularly on the left road from the station station to the market place.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly met on the road from a local, the bike driver could no longer brake in time, police said.
At the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and a 15 centimeter-long space wound on his head.
A rescue truck team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police reports to Assange
The British police have sent a release report to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had made a "required" calling for him to appear in a police guard, and added that he should not follow him, threatening him to be arrested.
Assange threatens the release to Sweden for a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exploited under British law since the Supreme Court has rejected its claim against the release at the beginning of the month.
As he feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he sought asylum on June 19 at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “invited a 40-year-old man to stand at a police guard at a time chosen by us,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit.
The embassy did not comment on the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spysuits after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
The driver with a 210 km/h and a hot drink between the legs receives £1,000 penalty
A car driver was sentenced to £1,000 because he was driving with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police arrested him, they discovered the cup of drinking between his legs.
In front of the Colchester Court, Howie became guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying costs of £90 as well as a sacrifice fee of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation blade
The finance ministry has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a 7% stamp tax on housing costs over £2 million and annual fees for buyers, holding housing as a company and not as individuals in the 2012 budget.
The revenue from the residential property tax already exceeds in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which in the tax year 2012/13 amounted to £708 million, collecting revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said, “After the increase in stamp tax on high-cost apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against treatment, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is too low, regardless of the impact of the old municipal tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained with regard to the purchase of real estate in London, or to stop selling owners,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Quarter, extending from Fulham to Wimbledon, decreased the record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by a rising “inland market” in which the southwest part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a rise trend, according to a Savills survey.
Scientists were able to throw more light on what connection a dog’s swelling is with his mood.
Earlier research has shown that happy dogs with the swing were moving more to the right (from the point of the dog), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trient University, said: “In humans it is well known that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side-by-side fluctuations of their species, researchers watch the animals while watching these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the shit moves in one way, one way in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, “We have shown dog films with dogs – either a natural-loyal version or a silhouette to eliminate other deviating aspects, and so we could control the movement of the swing more left or right.”
When the animals saw a differently expressed dog moving the goat to the right (seeing from the perspective of the sweating dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, if the swing was primarily left (or from the perspective of the dog, who wears), their heart rate increased and they looked discouraged.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he is convinced that dogs have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said, “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wedging with the swan is linked in a direction rather with friendly behaviour, and the right side produces rather a less friendly behaviour, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and coaches to better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and right when it’s a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada said: “Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when his ‘squirrel’ wages left and not to the right, rather than to be uncomfortable – exactly elsewhere than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs in the different studies.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“Although there are substantial evidence for many different breastfeeders that the two halfs of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are there no exception,” Bradshaw said.
But since their behavior is simply allowed to be recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the shit sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys Released in Glasgow for Disease Alex Turners
The Rock Band Arctic Monkeys has moved a show in Glasgow after her lead singer has had headache inflammation.
The band from Sheffield should play in Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be dismissed.
The band’s announcement came after she had already had to move a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys reported: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and at the medical council, Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1,.”
“In Alex Turner, a throat inflammation was diagnosed, so he couldn’t occur.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was released on November 21 at Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences resulting from this.
Please contact the customer service at the sales points where you purchased your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February
Pope Francis will be called new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also choosing a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope election – this falls to a group of 120 “elective cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said a meeting of all cardinals will be held before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as a conspiracy.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to initiate the conspiracy in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said the number of voting cardinals would likely fall until February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of elected cardinals will be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The conspiracy next year is significant because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
Currently there is a certain overlap on the sides of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the cardinal council founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the duty to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "good possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we haven’t been able to do that – it’s all new.
Valero said that bishops would typically be called to cardinals from large places, but Francis was “full of surprises, so we don’t know who he appoints.”
GM Calls New Pickup Trucks in the United States to Repair Seat Leaves
General Motors calls nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks back with construction year 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat loan, a statement from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resettling the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in headaches.
“When the vehicle is driven from behind, it is possible that head support does not properly protect the seizures, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.
The recovered models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the 2009 insolvency-related restructuring.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
Due to the 16-day Government shutdown, NHTSA could not check the notification letter, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks, newly developed for the model year 2014, has increased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra-Pickup trucks.
The GM stock increased by 1.4 per cent at the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperate shout of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that have been enshrined by the blockade tactics of Republicans
Blockade policy does not apologize for Obamacare’s website problems, drone attacks
Obama’s memory of the 2008 election campaign was a sad reminder of what was possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terrifying book.
It’s a book I’ve believed that it would raise me during the sad second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and paints Obama's memories for the presidential election in 2008.
When I’m finished with my patient recipes in the evening and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and a speech could break the breath.
The election was made a earthquake victory, and the news speakers held in order to lead the historical significance of this hour in front of the eyes.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval values.
And then I close the book.
Removal to the present is a bad awakening, as if you were removed from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad speech of lost opportunities.
In the years since I first issued my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's simply nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the party-political blockade tactic has taken too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay to mention only a few.
But after countless times I have defended Obama’s government against colleagues and acquaintances, I am ending with my statement attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why the hearing of foreign heads of state is allowed or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans’ privacy and why Whistleblower is punished to reveal public misbehavior.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without procedures, and why the public financing and exit limits were passed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report saying that the White House’s efforts to calm the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And recently it cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website within more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should expect.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the parliamentary office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre characterize the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that worries me most.
I re-electioned Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidateship.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unexpected alternative, he seemed to be unable to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would satisfy the hope we had heard from so long ago.
However, with the decline in Obama’s approval values to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become harder by this book.
It awakens in me the desire for the promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to infest a severe loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want you to find our magic,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts of interest in parental leave
Millionaire and Deputy Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parents’ leave plans because his daughters are pregnant and can therefore benefit from it.
The mountain magnate, which is in a court dispute about paying $6 million to CO2 controls, argued when he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important to decide whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or shortened.
However, Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parent leave, because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election commission Palmer officially declared a 53-vote prejudice after the recount to the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer asked for a review of the vote counting process so that it would be faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system that enters into a computer, chooses immediately, and then gets the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of bottles in the marking of the voting table.
Do you use them because you can get the results out if you don’t like them?
Today, it's incredible.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a common bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy belongs to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously".
In a public office, it is a public service.
“We do not seek any reward except that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its departure, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indicator of the global official investigation into the likely manipulations on the currency market.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigations in the world’s largest financial market, exchangeing $5.3 billion owners every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the out-of-the-art investigation that the scandal is moving around the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, who did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we work fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that the RBS had transferred the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the British supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now awarded to the European Forex Spot Trading Leader at JPMorgan from his current position.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was awarded this week and Matt Gardiner, former currency manager at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No one of these traders has been accused of misbehaving.
The Instant Message Group of Usher bankers were members of Barclays and the Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that she was investigating the alleged manipulation of the currency market with a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that banks have to deal with transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks pass instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misbehavior.
The news about these investigations has pushed the traders into an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affairs and said it was almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and high-grade liquid currency market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in currency trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to “man can already affect the market with very low ticket prices”.
The news came out on the same day Credit Suisse announced that this week she canceled a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after causing a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and worked with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has handled alone and that the matter has been intact,” Credit Suisse said.
The building area on the Bechtle-Grund piece
A group of citizens' initiative "Switzer Wiese" has decorated the construction zone on the Bechtle-grund piece at the curpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she dropped and spread the footstep, according to a press release.
The planned coverage of the falling house in the rear of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, as the area is threatening to disrupt.
Alfred Abel, who currently managed the property, had discussed the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI’s action, a transparent message with the message “We are for it” was installed.
However, about 20 members of the Citizen Initiative disturbed little in their action.
Their motto on the big post was called "We are against buildings".
So she wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss Wiese - the huge project should one day fail.
In conversation with many passengers before the "build" it was clear that some citizens believe that the city's project will be done much better, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city further delays these answers, it says from the BI.
As was heard, the public statements of the Mayor also had effect.
May, at the municipal meeting, said he was scared of the thermal bath, the citizens should vote against the plans for a swimsuit and wellness complex on the Swiss Wiese.
Some, therefore, appear to be quite anxious, others feel it as a "plump of attempts to empress" to the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donor for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick screws for Schiris: Don't have a swing king
As Ralf Rangnick is also satisfied with the current high form of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed the sports director of the "balls" by the arbitrators.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan will be pushed into the category of swallowing kings," he said on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The youngest reason for Rangnick’s criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, when the Senegal reader became a alleged actress to be defeated - which was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A sharp lack of decision," said Rangnick, the arbitrator named Harkam as "completely overthrown".
Harkam had also contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grand Coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He desired his German Landsman: “I would behave like Roger Schmidt in every situation.”
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the sharp mould.
I don't know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old said.
In the face of the success course, however, Rangnick agreed to a loving hymn.
“There are only two words for that: Very good,” he said.
There isn't much to expose.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
That should continue so calmly.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter-transmission period.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Except for a player, he has the desire to leave the association," Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court confirms Obama’s Health Act
It is a big victory for the Obama government: the U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the law on health is closely related to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges decided that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it obliges U.S. citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the State’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while judges decided against Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the law covering 2700 pages and also denounced the opinion that the provisions of the Health Act that States should either extend the conditions of access to Medicaid or otherwise would be deleted by any State Medicaid funds would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The complaint against the law was issued by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was denied by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the last challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election fight.
Norway: Norway's place makes it light with giant mirrors
With enormous mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian Orthenic light have brought into its dark valley.
Due to the low sunset rates, the Rjukan, located in the Westfjord Valley, usually falls from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters high, a century dream was achieved on Wednesday.
"Finally!", swore Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony at TV2.
Some valley residents went straight to solar chairs, others set semi-security solar glasses.
So far, sunny people had to ride to a nearby summit in winter with a sealing trail.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the radiations with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally adopted the costly project of 5 million krones (about 615,000 euros).
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpenort Viganella winter sunlight for several years.
Post is hardly taught on Sundays.
“Many citizens have not yet noticed that the red points for Sunday lecture are still in different mailboxes of the city and the city parts, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you quickly find that the leaning on sun and holiday days is no longer happening,” the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On sun and holiday days only before the post building is taught in Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in Jakob-Müller Street 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether it is also taught in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday, the FDP's answer to the question will not be answered.
The FDP’s social and youth-political speaker, Fritz Tubebeck, wants to follow here.
Sunday’s training is an important post service at the time.
"This entrepreneurship, despite the rise in prices for letters in January 2013, is radically and unacceptable."
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberals’ Fraction and City Association, supports his colleagues: “What irritates me is the fact that here in mystery the lessons are changed or also deleted.”
The post is nearby to the city.
"At least the mailboxes in the town areas must be taught again on Sundays Neuschloß and rosegarten," Bittner and tubebeck unisono.
Also applicable to the core city, especially not mobile co-citizens, had to be able to reach a postal box with Sunday reading also footwear.
Tubebeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to talk to the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, is also a Sunday school in Hofheim.
The party has spoken for privatisations.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt Parking Fees are to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
The city’s magistrate advises this morning on a presentation of traffic designated Stefan Majer (Green).
Parking fees should be increased by 50%.
However, prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking hours and parking slots should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Assembly has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt retail committee considers this "for no good idea".
The possibility of parking right before the shop is "a non-established advantage for smaller retailers".
The German Transport Club believes that a rise after two decades is "reasonable and in fact overwhelming" for a long time.
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick action overruling hosts
With a narrow frame, the Lords I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
Although the elders were with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
However, soon it appeared that they, even age-related, could not fully meet with the rapid actions of the joy cities.
With the hard and placed attacks, the Gönninger became extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean over the networks and were not in place in the blockade.
Two high first sentence wins clearly expressed the superiority of joy cities in all matters.
Due to this impressive and play-determining performance, the third sentence was then gained a bit lazy and lucky to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to move clearly in Nagold, there will be a significantly more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bauerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, in the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbronn, the second teams were facing Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt.
They delivered a hard-fighting two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused mainly errors and points donations; even in passports, the accuracy was sometimes deficiency and in some critical play scenes, the overhearters prevented the view of possible points wins.
In this highly balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team voted through the great physical effort and a joyful commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English house
For the fifth day of care following the above Hotzenwald project Natura 2000, a group of engaged participants met at the small English house in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, this day, in the area of the tent of view in the valley, the mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many walkers described this area as the brilliant piece of the castle, where the landscape offers the ideal frame for magnificent views.
He thanked the participants for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the day of care was an appropriate tool to strengthen the connection between humans and nature.
It gives every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time, with the tourist aspect, environmental consideration can also be found.
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect by the Department of Nature Protection of the Freeburg Government Presidency following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the control of the screen and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the perspective covers the objective of maintaining the old, widespread public field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the remaining widespread.
Certain species, such as rare foamers and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free connections for art maintenance.
Tribukait said she would not miss breaking a lane for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only in the form of this plan.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to develop sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement to the life project as well as the previous care days achieved for the future.
Following these different versions, Revier managers Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the aids in groups.
The larger trees were already beaten in advance, the forest screw is ready to call if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of guard buckets and the care of a dry stone rig.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Lefts: Heads still a single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baartchen City can be referred to as an attractive city, with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as its own urban works, no second mayor candidate has yet to be reported.
As the only candidate for the success of the no longer-candidate Mayor Norbert Brugger, the 46-year-old bankkaufmann and business owner Dieter Kapfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 18:00.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused of Nortel patents
The group, which owned thousands of former Nortel patents, stricted a lawn of complaints for patent infringement against drivers, including Google, the company that was overwhelmed by Nortel insolvency increases.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patent for $4.4 billion, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies of patent infringements in the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is shared by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent injury in seven cases.
The patents violate technology that brings search terms on the Internet in line with relevant advertising, as the complaint that thus meets the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make mobiles that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition for the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial offer of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and has last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was overwhelmed by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google has failed with its attempt to acquire the complaint patent at the auction, Google has injured the patent and continues to do so,” the complaint letter said.
Rockstar demands a high damage compensation from Google as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the allegation.
Egypt promises the first freely elected presidents
Mohammed Mursi leaves the office, but his day of triumph does not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was promised to be the first freely elected president of the country and thus held the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been dismissed 16 months earlier.
With his office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore to the judges of the court, dressed in black robes, whose seat on the Nile, and to an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at the celebrated ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have set the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old, a trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States, a fundamentalist group, which has been mostly taken into consideration as a prohibited organization since its founding 84 years ago by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building as Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven hours of local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to celebrate the new president, and, unlike the presidency of the Mubarak-time, traffic was stopped shortly so that the auto convoy could cross the normally lived road that connects the city centre with the southern municipalities.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the brotherhood has increased his personal prestige since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate for Islamists, but also all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising efforts against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, dressed in a blue dress with red crabs, explained to the judges in the headquarters chamber in which he gave the office.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should hold his accession speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the National Hymne that he heard in Habakkuk position.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the university’s largest hearing hall with spokespersons from “The Army and the people are a hand.”
The University of Cairo, established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a group of Islamic students in the 1970s.
Mursi pledged on Friday a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and pledged to recall the presidential powers that the military army had taken from the head of state hunted from the office.
But with the pledge of the official oath before the court, and not as usual before Parliament, he excites himself to the will of the military, pointing out that the struggle of power will continue.
Mursis Talk on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek takes care of two great evenings
The new season in Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday night it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday night it goes on with a U 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker falls from header: seriously injured
In exchange for a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a header and injured severely.
The man from Lampsrechthausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
As he ascended to the top of the roof, he pulled it out and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to the Salzburg National Hospital with the rescue shrub "Christophorus 6".
Violence in South Africa: Two-time life-long detention
Nine months after a 17-year-old girl in South Africa's brutal rape and defeat, the criminal has been sentenced to lifetime twice on Friday.
This was reported by the transmitter SABC.
The victim was later killed by the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The action had caused disturbance across the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in a industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town in February.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but misleading.
The view of the youth was so disgusting that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to be at night with Booysen in a bar.
He was also able to beat them and rape them, but he contested to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially denied several murderers, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was not enough.
The prosecutor also stressed during the proceedings that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Almost everyday life in South Africa: there are about 64,000 advertisements about sexual violence annually.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers in sexual violence at 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Schinken
Jumbo is looking for the "best Schinken in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7 Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker explains at the beginning: the most important thing for the pigs are the pigs, with the turboest not a good condition.
Can Schinken, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli as the head of the big Schinken factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite Schinken", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest Schinken.
Only with hair protection and kittel, he enters the factory’s interior.
Jumbo has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can get to the micro.
Jumbo seen for strengthening at fastlimbis in Woodshut
"I'm working in huge quantities here," the TV makers, black forests shrinking as a mass product.
16,000 columns per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat proportion, color: Uli explains what comes to the quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
TV with level?
Details like the Ph value of meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
“I’m excited to see Roberto Blanco what happens then,” Jumbo cited.
The level of private television in pure culture is presented here.
However, watching is worth it.
The viewer sees that breaking the columns continues to be handmade.
Because: Black forests are traditionally found without bones in the regal.
The secret of the chicken is the mixture of salt.
Smoking tower and smoking fire Jumbo optically reminds a "U-boat".
The trick: Dance branches provide in smoke for the special taste of the Black Forest Schinkens.
20 days in smoke make the shit almost black.
"Now the disc is gone in the jumbo," he announces the test recording.
"It's really tasty," the fatigue of the TV star.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
Do you think travel agencies belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now estimates a adjusted annual tax profit from $325 to $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are achieved, this is a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
According to CEO Graham Turner, Flight Centre earned 8 percent profit in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half, especially in Australian and British private businesses.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on a good way towards record-year income before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which typically are among our most powerful results.
In Australia, the recreational industry has recovered in the second half of the year, making it a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it worked well for the recreational business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers are also less expenditure here.
The U.S. business recovered compared to the seasonal weaker first half of the year, so a profit is expected for the third year in consequence for the whole year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are stopped to focus on mathematics, writing and grammar
In courses in English literature, students must treat at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels since 1914.
The examination also finds "unseen texts" input to encourage wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
As of 2015, students must provide an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as separate qualifications.
Tomorrow the Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculum for English and Mathematics – the first issues that were radically redesigned.
Other keyboards will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new use system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence,” emphasising that GCSEs would become “challenging, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that less time is spent in English schools for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On average, Australian schools teach 143 hours a year and students receive 138 hours in Singapore.
Although there is no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hours schedule, the comprehensive mathematics examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the classroom in ranking lists – will likely be encouraged to employ more hours in schools.
The curriculum focuses on “Problems from the Right Life”, including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Eco-Conversation Forum
At the next ecumenical talk forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the Castle, it is the topic "On Hell with the Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Deal with the Last Things".
The reporter is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church Church Salem, the Castle Salem and the Cultural Office of the Bodensee Circle.
Johanna Rahner wants to take a look at the forum of the question, how today people rank the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and put on those images of heaven and hell, “which make up our ideas to this day,” then the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of fulfillment is rather drawn out by a certain contempt or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope is that Christians have been properly expelled by religious criticism,” the referee said.
She has "provided us with so many questionnaire that we seemed to have been picking up the call signs."
Johanna Rahner continues to say, “But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death.”
This is linked to the question of that desire, "who dreams that everything may be good at the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg.
She promoted in 1997 to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The qualification for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälisch Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been in charge of a teaching chair for Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleinen Heuberg confirm their faith in the firm

In recent months, the firms were prepared for the great festival, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of many municipal members.
In different projects, they learned various tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the youth day in the undermaculate.
Illmensee: Second Mountain Bike Race Enthusiastic Participants
In great weather, 214 cyclists arrived in Illmensee to manage the round course through the hill chains around the lake.
This is reported by Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, particularly at the short distance of over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of height, were numerous wheelchairs each one who once wanted to exercise their hobby in competition atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good locations at the German championships.
Both of them were able to depart from the field as expected.
As in the past year, Felix Bader saved a small period of time to the goal and defended his title as a general winner of the short distance.
On the second place, Pascal Treubel could be placed again.
Theresa Duelli was from the Albrum team, who managed it on the top of the winners' stairs.
Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A joyful development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range was represented by athletes.
The age structure also ranged from ten years of age in the youngest to over 70 years of age in the oldest stars.
In the main race this year, there were even more absolute Topathletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to stop from the regional top drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-profile from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate have been a world champion twice in the 12-hour drive.
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named two German championships in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of height, there was a wimper strike final in the target course before the three-lake hall.
Pangerl grew first over the target line.
Just a second behind it, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall assessment.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the overall assessment.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was the area Blersch from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and assistants were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through slam, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance in remote villages in Cameroon
Bleeding and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In Western Africa, there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of the “CNN Heroes of 2013”.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges saw Bwelle with how his sick father lost his consciousness again and traveled to hospitals that had no means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then a inflammation that spread to his brain and there caused a hematome that should affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwelle said.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overfilled clinics and hospitals to get there the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first and is not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons couldn’t leave their visit.
Two out of five people live under the poverty limit and nearly a third of health expenses in the country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered in Bwell made the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a physician and worked as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization named ASCOVIME, which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people weigh in small buses and ride with the decreased medical equipment on the roof over uncontained terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to shoot the vehicles through rivers and slam.
But when they arrive, they will receive as heroes: a festival, singing, dance, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and with its wide smile and its unlimited energy, it is happy to participate in the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team starts with the examination of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometers around the village – and that’s walking.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, undernutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get bricks, donated glasses or free birth surveys – a document required for school, but many poor families can’t afford.
In the evening, the team will carry out simple operations with local injury.
Operations usually take place in a school, council or apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go into the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the OP and disinfecting equipment is fed by the group generator and thus the wave and its volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It’s an exciting pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They dump all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday the team then returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that it makes a huge difference with their work for people to help.
A man explained that the free operation of a leather break that he had now enabled him to work again.
“That changes the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I don’t really know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteered to join Bwell’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to spend money on the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nurse students such as O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe and support wave, this is a chance to collect practical experiences they would never get at home.
“We can be in operations where we help to bleed blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” explains O’Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary material with them.
But if they are only in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over accommodation, transportation and instructions.
“He is certainly a hero,” says O’Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no boundaries.
For bulbs, almost constant work is not a burden.
To help others in a more happy life and thus fulfilling the promise he has given to his father makes him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he'll see what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the struggle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway’s Novelle “The Old Man and the Sea”, was cut on the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old haze in his metier, the art of the actress.
The old man Santiago can't imagine anything when fishing.
This is how the two simply complement greatly.
It is almost thought to be able to see the shafts in the neck of the old man, about whom the fisherman manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of life sitting on the chair, that’s true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will.
Janson is on a wide range of routes as an ally performer on the stage.
He makes it possible to focus the audience’s attention on himself so that his monologues are not boring at any moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue-lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann let the old man act in the boat in front of the fisher village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in light: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise gunst, which with her songs and her glorious voice possesses the sense of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuban rhythm for it and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Departure to the Romans
At about 120 meters of length, a wastewater channel is received from the Roman era below Cologne.
Whoever visits Cologne does not go through the Dom.
Around 157 meters the two towers climb into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
However, a few visitors who admire the two filigran church towers assume that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Underworld.
A meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the deep garage," Schulze says.
In the 1970s, the forefathers wanted a car-reached city, and therefore the remainder of the old city walls remained just that which was not too large.
Most users of the parking lot today also cross to the remains of the Romans and just leave their car.
However, whoever looks more closely, in the park cover D2 discovers an archaeological finding separated by metal stains.
There are roughly five meters high ruins made of handheld stones.
"These are the remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century BC," Schulze said.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze allows the participants to look at the top of the parking lot in a window, 15 meters deep shade.
This is the source of the old house, which is unfortunately hardly perceived.
The next station of the circuit is the pretorium, and here the participants rise again into the depths.
Here we experience the office of one of the most powerful man in the north of the Alps, the governor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as "City of Roman law and City of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the pretorium is the former governor palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibit's storage room, a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel, which is retained here at about 120 meters long.
"You can quietly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Muntert Schulze said.
A surprise still has school.
After picking up the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, delicate shade.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to come to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washings.
Until today, at the bottom end of the Mikwe, whose origins fall back to the eighth century, different water conditions are ablesable by changing peels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Rathausplatz, for which construction work will be started soon.
However, there will be a few years to finish.
Nearly hacked leg: new edition of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be rebuilt after over four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous body injury and injury to two 30-year-olds began before the Frankfurt Land Court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The accused are silent to start.
They must have been active in the rock scene and have heard of the bandidos at that time.
The prosecutor suggests that in June 2009, together with unknown complications in Finowfurt, three men were wounded and killed in a car.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims should have heard of the competing group Hells Angels.
One should be a senior member of Berlin.
The previous was apparently a hunt with several cars.
According to the accusation, it was a reviewed fight and a power demonstration.
The two accused were released in early 2012 in a first proceeding.
A court spokesman said that there was no proof that the men had actually been involved in the bleeding fever.
The criminals had weared masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice revoked the judgment after review of the Prosecutor’s office and referred it to the Land Court for a renegotiation.
One of the accused is currently in open execution due to another offence.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the courses in the evening.
As a witness, the detective was charged.
In the center were phone calls of the accused and other people who had been interrogated by the police.
It’s hard that rockers almost always keep a copper law for them – and don’t say it.
The same applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had packed.
Attorney Stefan Golfier from the Frankfurt State Attorney (or) said on request that new traces have emerged since the latter proceedings.
For the process, 11 further negotiations are set up.
The wear company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but someday it went home.
Just: In the bulbs of people on the coach and back seat, hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, you may be responsible for one or other cocktail or sect!
What’s closer to driving to the next drive in to get a little bit?
I admit, I love to be with you when it comes to late night or early morning at fastfood holes.
A few pommes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco engines are noticeable.
Because what does a man need to miss to regularly throw his fast-food tits out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, thrown paper pockets are on roadsides and parking lots.
"Why?" I asked.
Are people too foolish to take the chickens at home, respectively, to the next miller?
It is not just that the paperwork changed the landscape.
Furniture has already covered transportation facilities such as guide boards, resulting in accidents.
About what he thinks, but not according to, he probably doesn’t even know what this word actually means.
When you’re on the road at night, only with a lot of people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after featuring nights: clamps, bottles and other waste get drunk there.
There there would be a few more or less puppies - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the rest of the foods of others.
I see the day coming when the cities and municipalities will be fooled and the fast-food chains will need to be used for their puppies.
Obama's return to health policy
After a harsh criticism, President Obama made a repeated, clear pledge: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands have received a cancellation letter from their insurer, the Republicans have told the President in the last days that he has deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama had relayed his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on cancellations, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look at the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive such a better, comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than expected.
“They’re getting a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as a little surprise that five percent of the population who concluded an insurance themselves had to look at another tariff as their contract did not comply with the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to say directly to these Americans: they deserve better,” Sebelius said in an interview with the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Acts, said that the launch of the online platform has expired since October.
“I’m as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
The speech of a senior Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at the House of Representatives yesterday was taken after a discussion with Republican Deputy Billy Long from Missouri on whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius reiterated the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Acts did not voluntarily resign from an insurance funded by the state to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov that she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
A U.S. government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, claimed on Thursday against the U.S. news agency CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an airline base in Syria’s Latakia one day before.
The target was “missile and related equipment” that the Israeli government feared they were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, CNN said.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base was shot in the port city of Latakia on Wednesday night, and Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, where Russian defence missiles of type S-125 Newa were seen, as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles that, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilometres.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency cites an anonymous Israeli government official with the words he believes Israel has executed the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defense said at least, "We don't comment on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously, in part, tried to deliver ground air missiles to the Hizbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt to supply Hizbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” that would follow a military response.
John Kerry explained in an unexpected statement that US spying was "unsuitable"
John Kerry, with an unexpected impediment, reported a resignation of the U.S.’s distorting attitude towards their monitoring programs by saying that the spies had gone too far in certain cases.
The foreign minister also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was liable to switch to "autopilot" when the explosive discoveries of Whistleblower Edward Snowden on NSA's spy activities became public.
Through the information that has been secured, the U.S. government has entered a diplomatic storm of disarmament by its allies.
In a video talk at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “I and others in the government have experienced some things that have been over by nearly a pilot, simply because the ability to do what is still going on the Second World War and the difficult years of Cold War and of course on 11 September.”
He then agreed as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the US spy has crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights have been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not affected.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives were saved through its monitoring processes.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to jump into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that sets out to kill people, jump into the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happened?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and killing people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to spread the concerns against the alleged American spies and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, as the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he talked to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was worried about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terrorism organizations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency’s surveillance.
“It is very important for the U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism,” Murphy, who is first sitting in the Senate as a Democrat and acting as President of the Senate Undercommittee for Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concerns about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have charged relationships with some U.S. allies, although the head of the Secret Service said this week that the reports are inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents transmitted by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the phone by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the National Secret Service, James Clapper, defended the spies in allies as necessary and explained that this is common on both sides.
In all the tumultus, Murphy said his authority was preparing the congressional journey to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members shall be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey is to improve relationships, he also said there would be some “the hardest words”.
He said that European governments should be honest with their population about the type of spying programs they have used for years.
“Although we can change our monitoring programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also meet with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, for John Kerry on weekends, a trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the horror of the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
A harsh injury to the jump line threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller's use in the FSV Mainz 05 outlet at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is trying to use Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only individually.
“We will decide on his job in the short term,” said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best torches with six hits.
The mainzers have already to resign from the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australians pledge for prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has filed a complaint against the judgment and has been released to deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she had reported a false statement to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the mornings on Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she was sure to get to her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she was able to figure out the story.
Until the court proceedings, she was in police detention on site.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day jail sentence in a low-security station on the edge of Phuket instead of in a jail for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted to have her back to Australia.
“We are, of course, very concerned, but we hope it will be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has filed a complaint against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on free foot.
In Australian reports, it was read that in the meantime she is taking a vacation in the holiday home Krabi in South Thailand.
From the court was heard that Bamford will be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and has been warned that the appeal can also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults.
Nevertheless, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent killing of the traveler woman Michelle Smith in Phuket, might be striving to improve his attacked tourist image, and therefore it becomes a release.
