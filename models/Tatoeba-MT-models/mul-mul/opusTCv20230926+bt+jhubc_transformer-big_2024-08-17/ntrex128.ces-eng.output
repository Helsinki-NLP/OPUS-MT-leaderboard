Members of the General Assembly are concerned that they will look like Mupeti
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are constrained by the proposal that their title should be changed into MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name may cause a laughter.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group is concerned that "it is linked with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales, twp means pity and pwp means cow.
Plaid’s member said the group as a whole was “not happy” and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh conservative said his group was approaching the change of the name "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter “w” is expressed similarly to the letter “u” in Yorkshire English.
The Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "The final decision on how members of the General Assembly shall be called, of course, will be on the members themselves."
The law of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public advice on proposals, where it received wide support for a variant to call the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the title of members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the greatest support in public debate.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus may be worried by President Elin Jones, who will submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules for the disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title in the context of the discussion of new legislation.
Macedonians will vote for a change in the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country’s name will be changed to “The Republic of North Macedonia”.
All votes should be resolved for decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athenians have long lasted on the fact that the name of the northern neighbour is a right to the Greek territory, and are repeatedly protesting against the request for membership of the country in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said that the vote would not rule.
Referendum supporters, including President Zorana Zaeva, however argue that change of name is simply the price for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's calls are quiet because the castles in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The elders with whom I talked say that there was a bar and a church in the past,” said Adams.
“There is no matter today.”
The disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are faced in a different way today,” he says.
“The bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people go regularly.”
As for the castle, he is concerned that the money from the sale of a property will not be enough for as long as their leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As it adds, the castles could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such kind of people who will not help the rest of the temples in the neighborhood.
“Absolutely most people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and therefore soon comes the day that these castles will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who are moving into apartments will become members of churches.”
Both castles built a white congregation even before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation was moved in the 1930s.
The building was occupied by the Black congregation, whose worship was not far away.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of reverent John Howard Johnson, who stood in front of the boxing of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping mall in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building severely, but when the farmers of Johnson's father planned to rebuild it, they also ordered an outcry.
Reverend David Johnson, the father of Johnson, and his successor to St. Martin, proudly called the “swords of the poor.”
The expert who played on the outskirts in July called her differently: "cultural treasure" and "unsubstitutable historical tool".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger musician at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says nobody has replaced him with St. Martin.
In the last few months, St. Martin had a complicated story of architects and builders, some of which were authorized by the letters of the church’s representatives, others by the Episcopal dieceze.
The Council of Elders – the chief farming authority consisting of laic representatives – sent in July a letter to diecezi expressing concerns that the diecezi will “sustain costs” to the council of the elders, although the nomination of architects and buildings that the diecezi has not been involved.
Some farmers complained of lack of transparency by the diecez.
Zralok injured a 13-year-old boy in California who warmed up for hummers
According to the official report, the rabbit attacked on Saturday and injured a 13-year-old boy who was buried for the Humors in California on the day of the start of the Humor season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he was warmed up with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then crashed to him with the whole group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel stated that the call was first considered a joy of catching the humr, but then “it realized that he cried out, ‘He heard me!
"He's got me!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that “he had broken the entire area of the key bones.”
“I shouted, ‘Everybody comes out of the water, ‘In the water there is a screw!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was transported in a critical state by a helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of rabbit stands behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that the rabbit had been buried in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Research and security agencies have closed 48 hours of access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of rabbits live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to build the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams cosmetic streets in the style of a business house, where specialized sellers will be available.
As part of a strong rise in the cosmetic market in the UK, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while fashion sales and domestic needs fall, cosmetic streets will be tested in 11 stores across the country. In case of success, then it will expand to further sales next year.
Investment in cosmetics is associated with the effort of supermarkets to find the use of regales used for television, microwave ovens and home needs.
Sainsbury’s says it doubles the size of the cosmetic product offer up to 3,000 products and introduces brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
More space will also be available from the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to brand locations similar to those in shops like Boots.
Supermarket also reintroduces its range of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the fragrance shop retailers’ concessions. The first such store opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and next year will be established in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and moving towards everyday shopping of small amounts of food in local stores means supermarkets have to try more to attract people.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says stores will look more and more like business houses because the supermarket chain seeks to offer better services and non-food products to fight discount sellers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of sales of Argos branches and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains that he bought two years ago, making food sales and acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt to submit a supermarket to the department with a cosmetic and pharmacy range ended unknown.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the link ended after a dispute about the distribution of revenue from the sale of drugs in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies three years ago for £125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is planning to play its role by adding to four stores a wide range of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s business director, said: “We have changed the look and style of cosmetic streets to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with which customers will be able to consult.
Our brand range should satisfy all the needs and attractive environments and a favorable location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is “discovered” after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for 11 million pounds
The Dragons Day Peter Jones series is “gree” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby resigned from a $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand so she can focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to make their home clothing and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to the Goop marker of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
Seventy-year-old serial moderator announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby deployed the star of the Dragons series Den Peter Jonese by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on its new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to information sources, Jones “swired” when a television star at a Tuesday’s pressing meeting at the center of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshir admitted that due to the new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – would no longer be able to spend enough time on their home clothing and accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of a Willoughby moderator in an estimated 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, a thirty-year-old on Instagram, announced that Truly was leaving, Jones left Britain to one of his summer headquarters.
The nominated source stated: “The Truly mark was the main priority for Holly.
It should be her long-term future, which will ensure her for a few decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants was shocked.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
In the centre of Marlow there is a full warehouse of goods ready to sell."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning moderator, which belongs to the most profitable British stars, could become a company of millions because of the heavy investment in products from towels and candles to clothing and home clothing and possible further delay to introduce the brand.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children of Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wives Tary Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tary Capp in 2016, and the 20-year-old Jones joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
Pairs are on vacation together and Jones has 40% share in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Anta McPartlin when moderating the I'm A Celebrity series on ITV.
The source close to Jones last night said, “We will not comment on his business.”
Difficulty “and then we fell in love”
He laughed at the criticism he received from journalists for a note that some people consider to be a “unrespectable president,” and for how well he talks about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded with a laughtered "voice" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their first June meeting in Singapore, Trump considered a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have taken place at the dead point.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "responsive response" to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the edge of the war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relationships with Kim, according to him, brought positive results – the end of missile tests, helping to liberate arms and return the remains of American soldiers to the country.
And he defended his unusual access to information about relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave as a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this overwhelming arena, we should have about 200 people who would stand right here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, in the situation after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations learned that it was not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was removed from their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a necessary prerequisite to accelerate international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," Sumbung says.
Save the Children, however, is a team that travels to Palo, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work here.
Mr. Sutupo, spokeswoman of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Paul to find out whether international organizations will be allowed to help.
Since an earthquake occurs very often in Indonesia, the country is still unprepared to the anger of Mother Nature.
In Aceh, however, there have been an anti-thunami hub, but in other parts of the coast it is not common at all.
He probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even the obvious lack of Syrian warnings in Paul before tsunami, although the warning was issued.
Even at the best time, travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
In natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that slaughtered in Lombok and helped the earthquake sacrifice now moves to Paul, but it will take at least three days before it gets to the place of the new calamity.
Improvement of the bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of the election campaign by President Joko Widodo, and the president lost a lot of money for roads and railroads.
The next year, he will try again for elections, but his government is undergoing funding outbreaks.
President Joko also faces pressure from the persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority receive a more conservative form of faith.
The street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use matte, holes, arrows and other primitive weapons, have already demanded the lives of more than thousands of people, and tens of thousands of people have expelled their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool shoots a Chelsea balance sheet
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, saving Liverpool from the loss of Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters before the Chelsea gate when his team lost 1-0.
He crossed the ball to the left and shot the remote ball.
The shooter flew high and headed toward the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball finally crossed the jumping Kep Arrizabalag and ended in the network.
“I just tried to get the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com server.
“I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn’t think much about it and shot one touch.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in half-time on the goal of the Belgian star Edena Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent the passport back to Mate Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the playground and sprinted to half of Liverpool.
The cowboy quickly wins the ball.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard's beautiful street in the valley.
He fled the defence and left ends to a remote wheel next to Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15 a.m., Liverpool in the Champions League group at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, runs with the local team.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London.
The number of victims of tsunami waves in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Office reported on Sunday morning, the number of earthquakes and tsunami waves increased to 832.
A 7.5-degree earthquake hit on Friday, triggered waves of up to 6 meters and imprisoned many people in the trees of ruined buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugro said at the press conference.
The city of Paul, which has more than 380 thousand inhabitants, was occupied with cutting-edge buildings.

Socha Cromwella in parliament recently became a hit because of a dispute about “recovering history”
His escape would be deserved by punishment for his fanatic puritan followers in the Taliban style to destroy many English cultural and religious artefacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "a rewriting" and "a rewriting of history."
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of socks, it was necessary that one of the goals would be made by Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminsters Palace.
Cromwell did not order or conduct an iconoclassmus in English civil wars.
Perhaps Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.”
The excellent creation of Cromwell, whose author is Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a proof of the 19th century view and part of the historyography of a character that many think they still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today is less than at the end of the 19th century, for the defence of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unexpected historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century created the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identified character that represents one side of this division.
His successes in the role of Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Killing pigs break the Chinese farmer
According to local media, the market in Southeast China has been attacked and kidnapped by pigs.
The South China Morning Post, a man whose only name is Yuan, was found dead with a warm blood cloth near the Liu-pchan-shui market in the province of Kuwait.
The pig farmer is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs on 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the Chinese province of Čching-chaj.
He and his cousin from the next province of Jün-nan arrived on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the side-click is open.
According to him, there was a large pig in the bowl with blood.
According to the information, the forensic investigation confirmed that 250kg of the farmer’s pig was broken down.
"The brother had his legs full of bloody and trembling," said Guiyang Evening News, a brother named "Wu."
On the security camera recording, you can see Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animals that killed the man were not belonging to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was closed so that nobody else could hit when the police collected evidence on the site of the crime.
Market representatives are allegedly dealing with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on people are rare, but they have already happened in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts, and men critically morninged.
Ten years ago, 300 kg of pigs were attracted to the tractor by the farmer’s wife.
After the Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a mannitoba farmer told the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the blood taste can act as a “slip”.
"They're playing.
They're the kidnappers... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them,” he said.
The remainder of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa, according to predictions, is weak and moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, there will be flood rain in northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. in the morning, Rosa reached 137 km/h wind speed, representing category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure bridge forms and moves to the east to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, it will be in the form of a tropical storm and start pressing tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical moisture with approximating low pressure in the next few days will lead to a huge rainfall in the southwest of the United States.
25 to 100 mm precipitation locally causes dangerous floods, subtle flows and possible soil sewing in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitations to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the U.S., especially above the majority of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the distorted nature of the tropical rain, floods can occur.
Given the danger of tropical precipitation, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
A strong rain may cause the canyons to become floating rivers, and the storms to bring locally striking winds and flying dust.
The nearby low-pressure bridge will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation may occur more than 13 mm, which could cause smaller streams of the sutin and clutch cars.
It will be the first rainfall period in the region.
On Sunday evening and on Monday morning, single tropical trails will be approaching Arizona, and on Monday evening and on Tuesday rain will be spreading.
A strong rain will spread to the Four corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic begins to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to intense temperature changes in short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebrasce and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, the summer heat will be expanded again.
In most territories in the middle and east of the U.S., the warm start of October is expected with temperatures around 27 °C from the southern planes to the northeast of the U.S..
In New York City may be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows the high probability of over-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Bretta Kavanaugh’s interrogation tracked more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people followed on six TV channels on Thursday's appealing statements by the candidate for the Supreme Court judge of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political path situation continued, and voters stopped regular programs with reports of sudden relapse on Friday: an agreement mediated by Senator for Arizon Jeff Flake that the FBI would carry out a weekly investigation into charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to dress her dress at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his exciting statement that he was 100% sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that the event has followed more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated average tracking on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at the offices.
For comparison, it is similar to the number of viewers who follow football matches in play-off or sharing the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest tracking of all stations, when Nielsen said it was tracked by an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day hearing.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
He continued his interest even after the negotiation was over.
The main character of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN cameras and CBS arrested him on Friday morning as the protesters shouted when he was ready to take a lift to the court’s hearing.
CNN moved live as a few minutes standing in the eyes of the cravings and left to give up.
A woman said to him, "I am standing right before you."
“Do you think the earth is telling the truth?”
He also heard that you have a great deal, but many women are not strong.
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and even before the door was closed, he added that he would say more about the committee's negotiations.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the court committee had to vote on the submission of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote to the whole Senate.
But Flake said he would do that only if the accusation against the candidate would be investigated by the FBI next week, which requires a minority of Democrats.
Flakea was partly convinced of his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump launched an investigation into the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh.
Britain’s Prime Minister May accused criticism of Brexit “politics”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plan to leave the European Union of "politics" about the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another interview that was close to the headline with the Prime Minister, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to pick their duties is “exploded.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson who was suspected of the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the case of killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The police department in Baton Rouge said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for a second-level murder charge.
The officials released a video of confrontation between Sims and Simpson and, according to the police, lost glasses in the game.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police secured glasses on the site of the crime and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson admitted that he shot Waydea.
According to the defendant, the deposit was set to $3500,000.
On Friday, the headquarters in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a fire injury to head and neck.
The Department thanks the police unit for the state of Louisiana refugees, the criminal laboratory of the State Police, the Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police for “drinking and striving for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, the average had 5.6 points and 2.6 scores per match.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday that Wayde's death by a team was "true" and "shock" him.
“That’s what you’re still afraid of,” said Wade.
Soup of potatoes in Mexico City
The pope, which waves from the Popacatépetl soap, hit the southern neighborhood of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the soup after the volcano’s activity increased and 183 gas emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center followed a number of kidnappings and tremors.
In some Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco, there have been images of the front-scale cars covered by a thin layer of poultry.
Geophysicians noticed an increase in the activity of the soup, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital city. The last earthquake struck Central Mexico in September 2017 with a power of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Anniversary of Independence Voting Police Conflict with Catalan Separators
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting for independence fought with the police and thousands of people participated in competition demonstrations at the occasion of the first anniversary of independence votes that Catalonia divided.
Ordinary police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw their eggs and dust-colored on the streets, which are usually flooded by tourists, created dark clouds of dust.
Later, the pockets came out, for which the police had to use their pockets to calm down.
In a few hours, independence supporting groups sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" faced protesters of the Union who shouted "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in protests.
The year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid considers to be illegal, but separatist Catalans celebrate, remains the tension in the region seeking independence.
Voters expressed themselves for independence by a large majority, but the participation in the elections was low because the opponents of the dismissal boicotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent conflicts across the region tried to stop voting in election rooms.
Independence support groups remained on Friday night outside to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to choose a different route.
The eighteen-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hoping for independence for Catalonia.
“We experienced one of the best moments last year.
My parents were crying for joy that they could vote, but now we’re in a blind street,” he said.
Despite the important, even though the narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence supporters had to fight to keep things in progress this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to the exile themselves or waited in the court for their independent participation in the referendum and following the referendum.
Twenty-year-old monster Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said the conflict was disrupted by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is increasingly stressful,” he added.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial in jail since the end of last year, announced Saturday that he would apply for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the fall of democratic values and repressions we are witnesses of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men imprisoned after car hit home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were imprisoned after the car repeatedly hit the house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 local time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was a damage to the gate and home itself.
Maybe somebody shot in the car at a moment too.
Meng's trick secured Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston, who ran out of the lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 matches in the role of Ibrox club manager.
Tref Dolly Mengy became decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't had a Premiership league yet, and next Sunday will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston extended a number of defeat-free matches in the division to six races, so the main coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has not yet experienced the defeat.
Livingston hasn't used the chances against unexpected guests
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before the goal, because his direct direction caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow in the match just dropped Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
Homes are enough to watch how Rangers play before them, because they knew that guests could deal with standard situations.
And that's how the key goal came.
Against Rangers, a free cock was set up and Livingston created a skull, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Meng, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, Rangers dominated holding the ball, but home defense for them was inadmissible, and broker Liam Kelly mostly had no job.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow failed to meet another standard situation in Livingston.
In the funeral territory of Livingston, the centers that the players constantly cleaned were flying, and two penalty cops came in after Halkett’s attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and others.
"Fenomen" from Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Fenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent and on their way up, they continue to overcome expectations.
Their game style and team have almost changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves a great praise for how the team has exploded since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, led a greatly organized defense, while Menga maintained all the time in the preparations of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
Once they were good under Gerrard, but these standards are no longer achieved.
Their end was chaba – only once they penetrated the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting for a mixed reception in Colina
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the sky was blue and all the same smile.
It is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan in Germany, aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of topics, including human rights, freedom of press and Turkey’s admission into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Colombia, where he opened a huge new mesh.
In this city there is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police for security reasons prevented 25,000 people from meeting the mess, but there were many supporters in the surrounding area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people, many of whom were Kurdish, were heard protesters against Erdogan who condemned his policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the controversy of a visitor, which some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocratic.
Deptford accident: a cyclist died after a crash with a car
The cyclist died in London after a raid.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 local time near Bestwood Street cruise with the ruined Evelyn Street street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and soon the sanitarian arrived, but the man was dead.
The death occurred only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half of the site of a Saturday tragedy at a Childers Street crash when the driver was caught from the site.
The metropolitan police said police are now trying to identify and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, buses ride through replacement routes and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: Six supervisors were injured in trouble
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in a male prison with high guards.
Anxiety exploded in the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershir on Sunday about 9:30 local time and still lasts.
In order to manage the oppressions involved in eight prisoners in one wing, specialized supervisors of the Tornado team were invited.
The supervisors suffered mild injuries and were treated on site.
The prison service spokeswoman said: “In order to manage the incident in Long Lartin prison, prisoners were specially trained.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisoners and it is clear that those who are responsible for this will be transferred to the police and can spend more time behind the networks."
In Long Lartin, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous delicts in the country.
In June, the director of the prison was announced that he had ended after a prison attack in the hospital.
And last October, in prison, ordinary units were called for serious concerns in which the staff was attacked by ball balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where dry can benefit)
It’s not usual that Arizon attacks a tropical low-pressure stroke, but that’s exactly what happens at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of the hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert west and brings the risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings against flooding on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter said: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of the tropical storm or the pressure below within 320 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane further 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rim, Arizona area of up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Lords, it is likely to fall from 25 to 50 mm, with local shells up to 100 mm.
For those who do not threaten the floods, the rain of Russia can be a blessing because the area has been injured dryly.
The floods are a very serious thing, but these rains may even help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just been injured.
Server weather.com states that according to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizony experiences at least "extreme dryness", which is the second highest category.
The hurricane route of Rosa first leads to the Baja California Peninsulas in Mexico.
Rosa, still with the power of a hurricane at a maximum speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and it will move at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and therefore loses power.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfalls will be strong, which represents a high risk of floods.
“In the Baja California region to the northwestern Sonoru, total precipitation is expected from 75 to 150 mm, with up to 250 mm occurring,” the server weather.com says.
Rosa then shields as a tropical storm across Mexico north and arrives at the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning, then passes through Arizona and enters the southern Utah on Tuesday late evening.
“The main risk of Russia or its remains is expected to be very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will cause mortally dangerous floods and sutin flows in the deserts and sealing soil in the upper ground.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three ten-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As reported by the police from Avon and Somerseth, young men aged 17 to 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who may have recorded what happened on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "experienced evil and anger" by the Democratic Party
“The vote for the judge of Kavanaugh is the rejection of the unseen and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a statement at Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh “have experienced evil and anger” during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh told Congress on Thursday, where he decidedly and emotionally refused Christine Blasey Ford's order that he had sexually attacked her a few decades ago when they were teens.
Ford also discussed the discussion on her charges.
The president said on Saturday that the day was “the American witnesses of Kavanaugh’s excellence and quality and courage.”
“The voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service at the end.”
The president indirectly urged Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talked about how important it is to make Republicans participate in elections in the middle of the term of office.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not hiding, but I'm still moving," he said.
“I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump stated that Democrats decided to "resistance and obstruction".
The President of the Republican Party said that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the ground will be expected at the latest on Friday.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is growing
Officials announced on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi affected extensive earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people died, many of which struck huge waves floating the beaches.
On the beach in Palu on Friday, hundreds of people met at the festival, but under the shadow of the coast, there were up to six-meters of waves, which many people killed and destroyed everything they had on their way.
The tsunami wave prevented an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people continued to operate on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they fell in waves for the victim,” said the Indonesian agency for relief of the BNPB’s Sutopo Purwo Nugro’s grave at the Jakarta coastline.
“The tsunami wave did not go alone, she took with her cars, claws, houses, she hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami wave spread at an open sea at 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Fire Relief Agency show many destroyed buildings and stores, brown and brown bridges and mixture surrounded by water.
The consequences of the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series has been felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In a statement, the Indonesian Assessment and Application Technology Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday’s strong blasts was about 200 times higher than the power of a nuclear bomb devoted to the Second World War in Hiroshima.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow strike, which could even increase the tsunami wave.
Nugro described the damage as “expansive” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been cut.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found crushed under the concerns of cutting buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho reported that the amount of victims and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Dongguan, near the epicentre of earthquake.
According to him, the communication was “absolutely protected without any information” from Donggaly.
In his statement, the Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and added that his employees and volunteers are going to the affected places.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse,” the statement said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday because she did not inform that Palu had attacked a tsunami wave, although the authorities stated that the waves came at the time of warning.
On amateur recordings shared on social media it is to hear a man in the upper floor of a building screaming desperately warning people on the street from the nearby tsunami.
Within a few minutes the coast will strike a water wall that brings up buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami waves caused a large drop in electricity, which interrupted communications around Palu, so that authorities could only be difficult to coordinate rescue work.
According to the army’s offices, it began to send cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarty and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transportation assistance and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had to visit the Palu evacuation center on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to more than 800.
That's very bad.
When the employees of the World Vision from Dongguan arrived in the city of Paul, where the employees hid themselves in the rooftops from the cells built at the courtyard of the office building, they saw pictures of destruction on the way, says Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of devastated houses,” he added.
It's very bad.
When the auxiliary groups started a sad action to help in disasters, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience did not have to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, stocks and personnel from abroad may begin to flow to the place of the calamity until the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the province level,” said spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but such a state is not yet.”
When in Paul the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who are still unknown still hoped that their lovers would be the miracles that relieve the cloudy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled out of the little boy's channel.
On Sunday, the rescuemen released the woman who was imprisoned for two days under the care of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian paragliding team coach, trained two of the missing paraglidings in Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon calculated how in the hours followed after the paragliding community learned about the downturn of Roa Roa hotel, desperately sent messages via WhatsApp competing from Palo who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue scratches, the news ended with a grey label.
“I think this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he says.
The thieves took $26,750 while supplementing a banknote in Newport on the Levee
According to a press report from the Newport Police Department, the thieves on Friday morning, Brink’s employees took $26,750 off when supplementing a banknote in Newport on the Levee.
According to the report, Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the car was emptying the bankomat in the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
When he did this, another man “leaped out of the Brink’s employees” and stole a pencil with the money to be put into the banknote.
According to a press release, witnesses saw several suspects fled from the site, but the police did not clear the number of people involved in the incidents.
For any information on the identity of suspects, inform the police in Newport at the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed its name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
The 14-year-old West has been named after Ye for a while and used the pseudonyms as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new Yandhi album.
In the show, she will replace the singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her participation for “sensitive reasons”, as the series’ maker said.
West had previously said that the word for him has a religious significance in addition to shortening the existing professional name.
“In my opinion, it is the most used word in the Bible where it means ‘they’,” West left to hear about his album at the beginning of this year when he spoke to the radio moderator Big Boy.
“When I am you, I am you, I am you.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to the only Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our distressing, everything.
The album is a reflection of what we are."
She also changed her name with a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names of Love and Brother Love.
Ex-West co-worker JAY-Z also replaced his name with a linker and without him and with large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises he will not use an army against civilians
At the nearby 50th anniversary of a bloody intervention against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.
At the time that the Left Student Movement spread throughout Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting people for a peaceful demonstration on the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to students and opening additional free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education attract young people to criminal gangs.
US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published AI announcements, although the U.S. as a whole does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced last year a plan to be one of AI innovations by 2030.
“The double budget for AI research would be a good start because all the other countries are far beyond the US and we are looking for another AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC that doubled funding could double the chance that the next big discovery in the AI area will be made in the United States.
Lee, who published this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt’s book Supervelopers AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on the AI system, which overcame the best American player in the game Othello, and later was Microsoft's leading researcher and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee assessed the previous U.S. government’s technological competition, such as the Robotic Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when further to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to try hard to get government grants.
“Academic tops are not deprived of China, but corporations,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed the best university experts to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve efforts in the area of AI, the U.S. could also help change in immigration policy.
“I think the holders of a PhD in the AI should automatically be offered a green card,” he says.
The China State Council issued a new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense founded this year a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage partners in the sector and the academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
DARPA announced this month that it invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
As regards the NSF Foundation, AI currently invests more than $100 million per year in research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for several months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum if they want to change the name of the country
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia", which would solve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory, and hence Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments signed an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents insist that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott raised doubts about whether at least 50% of the voters would receive the necessary to make a referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was, “Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the name change, including the president of the government Zorana Zaeva, claim that it is the price that it is worth paying to make Macedonia, one of the successive countries of former Yugoslavia, can join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come to vote today for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
However, the referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament said they would follow the result of the vote.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The election committee said no problems have been reported within 13 hours.
However, election participation was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters finally voted.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son of Dushko vote in a Macedonian referendum on a change of name, which would open the country’s journey to NATO and the European Union, in Strumici in Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and draws chairs in front of tents constructed by people who bow down a referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with the head, not the door for service,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are poor, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other people like China and Russia and become part of the euro-asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate exceeding 20%, so much investment.
“I think a large majority will be for because more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after he voted.
The result of “yes” would be “the confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, the referendum could be held between 30 and 43 percent of voters, which is less than required.
A further survey organized by the Macedonian Telma TV station found that 57% of respondents would vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would be voting.
In order to make a referendum successful, 50 percent plus one voter must participate.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious injury to the policy of the Western government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City reached the goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling set up Brighton's defense on Saturday, ensuring Manchester City win 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the administration of Aguera, his goal in the 65th minute seemed ridiculously easy.
Everything began with the recording that the Argentine attacker received in the middle of the field.
He advanced between the three brighton defenders and entered an open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green trees.
On the edge of Brighton's penalty territory, one defender was surrounded and a few others were predetermined.
The next left side was found by Sterling.
The British assaultor crashed the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton's Gateway Mathew Ryan by shooting to the right side of the network.
“Aguero has problems with the legs,” City Pep Guardiola’s manager told reporters.
“We thought it would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky to have a goal at that moment.”
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this Premier League match was arranged by Sterling.
This goal fell at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton.
On the left, he sent the beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane made the ball and then sent Sterling to a distant piece.
The Sky Blues attacker dropped the ball into the network just before he dropped out of the playground.
City will play Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to break the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were dismissed from the play-off fight, there were no many reasons to play again.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes that he will be ranked as a shooter in the Colorado Rockies match on Sunday – however only when Rockies, who lead in NL West for one match over Los Angeles Dodgers, will have a play-off hope.
Rockies had at least a wild card to win 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to win their first degree in the division.
“Even if we don’t talk about anything, we can at least entertain ourselves because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will probably play with the greatest effort I’ll experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?”
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are allegedly knocking to find Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start. He trained on Thursday, and he would defeat on Sunday, when he usually had a vacation.
Washington’s right-wing striker has this season statistics 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 exchanges.
Trump pleaded for meetings in West Virginia
The president expressed his position around his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Bret Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans to participate in elections in the middle of the term of office.
“In November we will be on the wager everything we can do.
One of the most important elections in our lives has remained five weeks.
“It’s one of the big, big – I’m not Indian, but we’re still in motion and I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see a terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are committed to taking power with any necessary means, you see this evil, resistance.
They don't care who hurts, who has to overcome to get power and control, it's what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "resistance and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, "The Democrats are "your anger and evil and rebellious and cursed."
He mentioned, on behalf of the eldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a voice-break of obesity.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get that document out?
Uh, what?
No, ehm no, wait, it was really a bad speech of the body, the worst speech of the body I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a variety of views.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions.
When Moment activists voted for my remarks in my local party, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a series of Labour Members who said they were not welcome – because they honestly said their opinion.
My colleagues in parliament Joan Ryan were treated similarly because she was resolutely anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in the note that I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, with regard to national security, with regard to Europe, paradoxically similar issues, which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a Friday Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East, it wrote that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I was a local parliamentary member behind the labour party, the GC meeting on Friday evening was exactly the same.
Today, most of the meetings are unfortunately ignored, and the promise of a “better, more gentle” policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever started with it.
It begins to become increasingly clear that different perspectives in the labourist side are intolerant and every opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues I had previously thought we had similar political opinions were suddenly expecting me to turn around at 180° and I would hold positions that I could otherwise not agree with – whether it is national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and no matter what I am saying – then follows a social media survey of claims, where they call on my appeal, condemns politics on Wednesday and tells me that I should not be in the labourist side.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I have more luck than some of my colleagues because comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for professionalism and commitment to those who face sexist or racist offenses every day, but never leave.
One of the aspects of this era of politics, from which I am most disappointed, is how insults become a standard.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a variety of views, and with any proposal to express unconfidence or change the rules of selection, the party becomes more restricted.
In the last two years, I have been advised many times to stay back, not so much and then “I’ll be okay.”
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since 32 years ago I was a school student in the Labour Party, provoked by Margaret Thatcher’s government, which literally let my class of general school break down, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need it most – whether as a local council or minister of government.
I have never hid my politics, even in the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is coming to Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
However, my main message is not intended for the moment in Nottingham, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labourist Party or not: I am proud that I am serving you, and I promise that no threats to appeal or political pragmatism will drive me from acting according to what I think is best of you all.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: The Undefeated Ayr ascends to the top
The two late five slightly disrupted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly fun match Tennent's Premiership.
Now they are in front of the tables, as the only inconvenience.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the chances that helped home to win, and Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been through big tests in our matches and we're still inadequate, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "All the honor of Ayr, they've been treated with chances better than us."
Five of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numbers and Jason Baggot won the unprecedented five.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayr with a penalty and then scored and transformed the solo test in just half-time, so adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's five, changed by Baggo, reduced the leadership to five points.
Afterwards, a further retention was followed by the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who left the playground on the wheels, and when he began to play again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall, which he changed Climo.
Representative captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose used the players again thanks to the unprecedented five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
However, they returned home, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow for the attack on Clima without the ball, MacPherson put the ball in the penalty series behind the ongoing Ayru mule.
Climo changed again, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's head and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home.
Still Game starts a new career in hospitality
The Star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series appears to be transferred to the hospitality sector. It was found to be appointed by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, sixty-year-old actor, plays in a popular BBC series that writes and in which he plays alongside his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphille.
The two announced that the next nineth series will be the last series, and Kiernan seems to plan his life after Craiglang.
According to the statement from the Official Register, Adriftmorn Limited is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the report, but the source of the Scottish Sun said Kiernan wants to participate in the "progressive business in restaurants" in Glasgow.
“Sea is ours”: Internal Bolivia hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific
The navy guards before the navy command in La Paz, which is decorated with lane.
Beyond the public buildings, the blue flag is in the colour of the ocean.
The sea bases from the Titicaca Lake for Amazon are described with a password: “The sea is our right.
To get it is our duty."
There is still a live memory of the coast that the countries lost in favor of Chile in the bloody war for resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to rebuild the Pacific Ocean.
These wishes are perhaps the largest in a few decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court, which should fall on October 1 after five years of year.
“Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects a positive result,” Bolivia’s diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will follow MSD decisions on large screens across the country with hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that, after many decades of discontinued conversations, Chile is obliged to act on providing Bolivian with sovereign approach to the sea.
The charismatic home president of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle for reelection next year – is also of great interest in Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia – and even if that happens, it wouldn’t change much.
The United Nations Authority with its headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to allocate some of the territory of Chile and said it would not determine the outcome of possible interviews.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the latest arguments indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not only supported Bolivia’s affairs, but maybe they’ve even shattered it.
"The issues of access to the sea were empowered by the existing Bolivian government," Zarate said.
She adds that Morales's attacking rhetoric weakened all the remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again begin to act, but after that it will be extremely difficult to conduct discussions.
Both countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in Haag, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually fast.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia “a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – would use the question of sea as a political bullshit.
“Bolivie never abandons its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless the U.S. is unable to believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarma its nuclear weapons as the first if he cannot trust Washington
He spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill promises made at the summit of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it appears that U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to restart nuclear diplomacy that has been arrested at a dead point for more than three months for the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “planning of hope” that the ongoing U.S. sanctions and opposition against a declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes strike North on the knees.
Washington is cautious about consent with the declaration unless Pchjongjang does not take significant steps to disarmament first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, general skepticism is concerned that Pchjongjang thinks seriously that he will reject this arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongjang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris overviews show that your fashion stores will soon reach the latest trend of huge head covers
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of tremendous head covers for their collection of spring/summer 2019 at an overview that took all of them on the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats flood Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the moon.
A piece of exhibition from Valentina was a overwhelmed beige hat with a wide edge resembling the pearl that floated the heads of the models.
Other excessively large supplements were decorated melons, witch hat and even ananas – but they are not intended for head heating.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of strange masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the pestro-colored masks have shaved mouths and rather resemble Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One design resembled the heating equipment with snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a corn with a frozen ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion – you’re lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge bowls could also come to fashion stores.
Overgrown hats come for "La Bomba", a half-meter wide cream that everyone wears from Rihanny to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand standing behind this very unpracticed hat, which floated social media, sent to the overview mould another huge creation – a smooth beach bag, which is almost the same as a model in the pools that wears it.
The dark orange raffle bag leaped with raffles and white leather handles was the exhibition piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection from Jacquemuse at the Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion shops next summer – since the designer had such a great success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are a need for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a number of academic successes behind them, and it continues to be another excellent test results in 2018. Individual and group successes in sports, artistic, music, and other community activities just highlight it.
These schools have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide their students and parents with the best level of service.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and instead as global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement individually customized school education plans, we notice that modern languages are still popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it goes straight into his mind.
If you speak with him in his own language, it goes straight into his heart.”
It is an important point of view that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year’s trials show that languages are the first place of tables, with a higher level of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language reached the best A signs.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools indicate that the highest brand A reached 72 per cent of Mandarin students, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and youth will certainly need in the future.
Languages as subjects that students choose are equally considered in independent and other school studies as STEM subjects (science, technology, technical scopes and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skill Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of insufficient linguistic skills for reasons for which employers consider to be the problems of occupiing vacancies.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
Since more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whether you choose any career, if you learn another language, you will have a real advantage in the future that you have such a lifelong skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains advantage of competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them were unable to speak foreign language well enough to conduct conversations, while the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage of people, particularly 15%, was French.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially the languages of developing economies, they will have greater chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school is different from what languages she learns.
A number of schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whether the child is interested in anything, he will always have a choice in independent schools of several languages with teachers who are professionals in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools are dedicated to ensuring the educational environment that children will prepare and equip the skills needed to succeed, whether it is in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global entrepreneurship environment, so that it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this selection, diversity and sights.
We have to do it right.

LeBron will be introduced in the Lakers dress for the first time on Sunday in San Dieg
The fans who are looking forward to the first time LeBron James arrives at Los Angeles Lakers will soon be waiting.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the San Dieg predecessor match against Denver Nuggets on Sunday.
It is not clear how many minutes it takes.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told Lakers.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after the training, James asked about his plans for six Lakers matches in the pre-season.
“I don’t need a pre-season match at this stage of my career,” he said.
Trump's presentation in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of performance in the campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five of the tenants planned for the next week, including stops at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Due to the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate to a position released in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in half of the mandate, as Republicans stand in November's elections before the risk of losing Congress.
How many hours will Trump’s show start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 East Time, today on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's property in West Virginia online below via live YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearing of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh, which took place this week, and was very stressed for accusation of inappropriate sexual behaviour. The Senate's confirmation vote is expected to be delayed a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of the hammers is to help the Republicans take the pace before November elections.
According to Reuters, the campaign organizers, President Trump, said that these five meetings were aimed at “adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans could try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House.”
“Control over the Senate is so important for his agenda that the president will go to the most possible states during this disruptive season,” Trump’s spokesman Reuters said.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, today's discussions in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could come to supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and can be watched by the media from Pittsburgh."
It will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who stops the investigation.
“For Morriseye, it is not a good sign that the president has to come to help him in his surveys,” said Reuters, a politician from the University of Western Virginia, Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has a stomach to fight to keep hope before Sunday singles
After three single matches, the pairs can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The sweat is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the kidnapping going on now?
"They've got six points, and now it's four, so we're taking it so that it's probably moving a bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has a advantage, it leads to four points and remains twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in the hills, and there are many things that can stimulate them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each can be praised by three points in four.
Spieth was deadly when he moved from the fireplace to the green and was an example.
The celebration shouted still strengthened the continuation of his wheel when he managed the key pat to win the entire match when he was with Tomas after two jams of two backs.
His potter, who won them a 15-jacket match, met with a similar row that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
“You really had to go deeply and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that each of these players left.
18 jackets to leave tracks.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontroversially main story of Ryder Cup.
Strange but luxurious couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a jack on Saturday afternoon, but it was also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning again.
This course and the way energy flows towards a storm audience confirms that these are the players destined to win on Sundays, and that in the west of Le Golf Naitional will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best of both at the same time with a different guarantee.
Speech about European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergi García, the hero of four balls in the morning when he was associated with Alex Noren.
James and two dably buried Spain and Sweden on the front of the nine in a cave from which they had no longer escaped.
But no one will help you on Sunday.
Two pair games on two balls are so fascinating when you closely watch the interactions with people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and this two-double game has also shown that the U.S. team has a stomach for the fight, which some, especially from the states, doubted.
The final day of Ryder Cup leads Europe with 10-6 points
Europe gains a healthy benefit by the last day of Ryder Cup, and from the two-ball pair games on Saturday, it came out with a hit of 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly won almost twice over the match Tiger Woods, decided to make four matches at Le Golf National.
The European party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided to hold the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the morning games on two balls with the American party that failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two matches, but could not reach the deficit.
Jima Furyka needs eight points from Sunday's 12 matches to leave the troop.
Fleetwood is the first European newborn to win four points behind himself, while he and Molinari who have received the overname "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend are only the second couple who won four of his four start-up matches in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed in the game for two balls and then smoothly defeat the tired Woods and the American newborn Bryson Dechambeau even more emphasizing 5&4.
Woods, who extended two matches on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in a double game for two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, retreated after the morning game for two balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brookse Koepky - one and three in the world rank.
However, Europe did not have a day in this pleasant freshness to the southwest of Paris won on the whole line.
The three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a hard 2&1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game for two balls and returned later to defeat the couples Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game for couples, although he lost the first two jams.
Only twice in Ryder Cup’s history, the team returns from a four-point deficit into a double game, although as a defendant, Furykova’s party only needs a remit to gain a troop.
After the second day was the best in two days, it appears to be a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says it will not "in any case" be disarmad unilaterally and without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday that the continued UN sanctions have deepened their lack of trust in the United States and under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea had adopted “significant actions of good will” last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the demonstration of nuclear testing sites and promises that they will not spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see the corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarma unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the known North Korean complaint about Washington’s opposition to the “step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step, his statement appeared as significant in the fact that P did not reject the unilateral denuclearization only because of this.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed himself to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formally end the war conflict between 1950 and 53, but the United States said Pchjongjang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also addressed the challenge to release tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. continues to ‘denuclearize first’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to force their goals, and even oppose the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to the knees is the dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our lack of trust.”
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, saying, “If the side of this question of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such a path situation.”
However, the tone of Rih’s speech was dramatically different from the last year he told the UN General Assembly that the focus of North Korea’s missile on the U.S. territory is inevitable after the “made President” Trump named Kim as “a missile man” on the suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened “total destruction” of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that a lot of work and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, he said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pchjongjang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the violation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue rapidly and without mouth until we are aware of complete, final, verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to suppress the financing of nuclear programs and ballistic missile programs of Pchjongjang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly by the party and Pompeo announced that they would visit Pchjongjang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pchjongjang in July and declared that progress has been made to only make North Korea declare that it was tolerated "gangster demands" within a few hours.
North Korea has pledged to meet Moon this month to demonstrate the missile area and also a nuclear complex if the United States adopts “a corresponding action”.
He said Kim told him that “the appropriate measures” in which he hoped are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and is aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students participate in a course to teach them enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year has forced all of its students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight the growing culture of macho study throughout the night, when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
Academics found that the world’s most prominent university students are often unemployed when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was proposed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and women's hospital, who is believed to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he predicted the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came to me at the end and said, ‘Why do you call me that right now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletics performance and improve their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said that the university decided to launch a course after finding students were really seriously unsleeved during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, the picture of the student railroads where students click on cups of coffee, cloths, tennis and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by a lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In other parts, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in “the study of the whole night” still exists, he added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are also increasing the problem of lack of sleep.
A lack of sleep of good quality should be a student's "secret weapon" for fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid recovering, because sleep deprivation switches the brain to hunger mode, so that a person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that graduated from one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the whole course.
Hopefully, the next step will be to request all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended students to consider settings of alarm at the time to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can determine your circadian rhythm, leading to problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga hit Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered further loss when Dolly Mengy confirmed Steven Gerrard's disagreement with the 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox party tried to record its first triumph in St Johnstone from February 4 to February 1, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time, and Rangers' composition seemed to be without inspiration and commitment to balance.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and immediately behind the Hibernian team, unlike one branch.
And other Rangers problems could occur after Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he had apparently hit the object from the point of view.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which crossed around Ayr to the semi-final Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Levi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would have joy as his well-trained team breathed his rivals on every step.
Rangers may have controlled the holding, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They had to score only two minutes after the start when Menga first left Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's port, but the backup buried his great chance.
The distant free head of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could just try at the back.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to have more hope in the last third than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a fourth-hour track penalty when he hit Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson denied the Colombian challenge from the table.
Rangers managed only two shots to target in the first half, but the former Ibrox brander Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibaly's head and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's openings could have been against the game's running after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for that nightmare.
Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep seat again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and wrapped Meng into an easy finish.
Gerrard hit the action and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost an immediate result when the wing broke into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was fighting from the line and the attack blocked.
But Livingston continued to incorporate visitors into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metalled one long ball behind the other.
Holt's party could deepen its mass in the final stages, but McGregor was well built to block Jacobs before Litgow broke out of the corner.
Rangers' deputy Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to be punished when he squandered with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back again.
Almanach: Inventor Geiger's Reader
And now the page of our almanachu Sunday morning: 30 September 1882, today it is 136 years old, and still increases... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter also became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of the apparently unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s reader that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you plant these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: “Yes, it’s really going to get out of it now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes immune cell extraction from the patient and their transformation into a laboratory
They can then "see" protein, which is common to many cancers, and then use again injected
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes immune cell extraction from the patient, their transformation into a laboratory, so they can "see" the common protein in many cancers called HER2 and then re-apply to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “manages the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and "learned" was to focus on cancer cells, was already promoted in the treatment of type leukemia.
Kanye West participated in a pro-trumpous ministry, in his headquarters, after his presentation to the SNL.
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was recorded in Saturday Night Live after a confused presentation, during which President Donald Trump was praised and said he would be candidate in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he had the head of Make America Great Again, he began to swim for Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often speak to the whites and they say to you, ‘How can you just like Trump, because it’s racist?’
“If I had misguided racism, I would have been in America for a long time,” he said.
SNL launched a parodia show with Matte Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star laughed at the testimony of Bret Kavanaugh in front of the Senate court committee on Christine Blasey Ford rape.
Although it was not broadcast, West's theatrical speech recordings were loaded on social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West.
West also complained to the viewers that he got his head decor well burned even in the cave.
“I was scared in the crash.
They said to her, "Don't go there with that hat."
That's a shit!
They also said I was in the wrong place,” Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Will you see the wrong place?" and added, "Will you plant your superman dress because it means you can't say what I am going to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments deserved only the audience's noise at least twice, and SNL members seemed worse, in disappointment, says Variety, and one person even said, "The whole studio was completely exhausted."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has defeated many of the present by singing the song I Love that was dressed in the water bottle of Perrier.
West received support from TPUSA’s conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: THANK YOU, YOU HAVE PASSED DAVID.”
But the host talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West “was just who he was, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I DO NOT want to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’), for which I believe it represents and transmits into the world of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and goes on tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, formerly named Snoop Lion and, of course, the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Prosecution of a murder attempt in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of a murder attempt after killing a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused should stand before the court in Belfast on Monday.
The accused is reviewed by the State Representation.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington left to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jona Snow with a sword in hand in the violent medieval fantasy of the HBO series.
A 31-year-old actor, however, came out of the macho hero stereotype and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be claimed to deserve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed that something was wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his star star about the throne of Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that it is "fully strong" to express this problem.
"Now I feel personally, quite strong - what happened so badly to the male?"
"What do we learn from teens about the problem we see here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic maleness thanks to its very male characters.
He continued, “What is born and what is learned?
What do boys learn in television, in the streets, from them grows the feeling that it is necessary for each man to have such a side?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because the young men have changed something worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any preque or sequence of the Game about the throne after completion of the series, because he already has enough "fights and horses".
Since November, Kit will play in the Renovated Right West of Sam Shepard, who is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, the lump.
The actress recently revealed that meeting with his current wife Rose for the best that came from the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife when I played the series, so he gave me my future family and my entire life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a love object of Kito's character Jona Snow, in this fantasy series awarded the prize of Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family house in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China says 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people have been affected by the virus in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people annually.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married to women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff would allow GOP Senators to avoid data, calling the term "Dangerous Lies" and "Conspiracy Theory"
Mrs Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned the claim that a member of her employees sent personal data from three Republican U.S. senators to the lawmakers' wikipages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were supported by "ultra-medical" scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies, and other rejectable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released was allegedly included home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utahu.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate's meeting of accusations of sexual abuse by the Supreme Court's candidate, Bretta Kavanaugh.
Sometimes the information escaped after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which sources of contributions, is linked to the Waters Office and published information about Waters staff members, Hill says.
“This unfounded claim is totally false and absolute lies,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these false and false charges – was in no way responsible for the eradication of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally false and absolute lies."
Waters’ statement quickly served online criticism, including that of former White House printer, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This indicates that he has no temperament to be a member of Congress.”
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He must not be oppressive.
It should not be questioned about the complainant’s motives.
He must be calm and not excited.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism towards the judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed too distraught during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his ideas on Twitter.
“If it was true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office has “alert the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the offenders are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are devastating and dangerous to everyone and to all members of my staff."
Johnny English reinterprets reviews – weaker spion parodie Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new British trend film, which seems to be the case of this Johnny English re-restoration in a series of action parodies - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this satira's trap be on the issue of how obviously a bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this exhausted, incomplete Johnny English with a rubber face had its license to repack the things in a completely new way - that's the name more than any other signal that it's a wide comic creation designed for a non-English speech cinematographic audience.
Of course, he's the dumb secret agent who, despite his strange claims to smoothie glamour, has a little from Inspector Clouseau's, a sketch of Mr. Bean and a big cousin of that guy who has put a single tone in the soundtrack of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics celebration in London.
The post was also originally based on a traveler and an international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard television ads, and left behind the chaos.
In this last edition there will be one or two beautiful moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the medieval arms, and the rotor heads briefly cincled on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite underdimensioned and strangely overwhelming, especially when the "serious" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is rather as if it were intended for children than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy trampouses are so inventive and focused as Atkins' quiet film gages in Mr. Bean's face.
The current assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
The cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret web network of spys and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field to intimidate an agent in the service – to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the prime minister who is a pompous and occupied character who has already suffered under a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson's character plays the best possible character, but in the scenario there is nothing too much.
Her reporting advisers inform her that as soon as every active spy is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury device, but at the same time gives record lessons about how to be a secret agent: here are a few beautiful gags because English offers a spion academy like the Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long-term partner Bough, who was again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the Navy, an afflicted character on which Vicki Pepperdine may even be a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin in packing tasks for His Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and meet with the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subjected to the magic of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the devastating Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their departure full of franchised patalions: masks as a garbage burn the French restaurant; they create chaos when they miss the luxury yachts on board Volt; and English launches a pure anarchy when they try to get acquainted with the interior of Volt.
All exams are definitely ready for this last sequence, but whether it is self-friendly and stormful, it has something from a child TV in itself.
It's a very moderate matter.
And as with the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't think: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labourists denied to develop a plan for English working four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and pay for five.
The party claims that the boss of companies will provide savings to workers resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still get the same reward.
Sources argue that this idea would “wire” into the party’s economic agenda and plan to bring the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way that workers can take advantage of changing economies.
A long-term labour member told Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that falls into the party’s positions to balance the economy in the interests of the workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support this idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokeswoman said: “The four-day work week is not the policy of our party and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to fulfill his vision of the Socialist Revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was committed to returning energy from “anonymous directors” and “scientists” in utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies don’t have to return to their overall share, as the labour government could carry out “crashes” on the basis of the perceived crime.
He also confirmed plans for the placement of employees in the boards of companies and for the establishment of funds for own owned, which transfer 10% of private enterprises’ own capital to employees entitled to pay up to 500 pounds of annual dividend.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in the 60-minute series, whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The FBI's prosecution against Judge Brett Kavanaugh resigned the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, asking whether the findings of the Office could hit some Republican senators in their support.
In an interview from Sunday 60 minutes, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would have to change their opinion.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to the judge Kavanaugh.
I called to him when it happened, when the accusation came out, and he said, "Don't you do that?"
He was determined, determined, clear.”
However, Graham’s decision is unpleasant.
“I have already made my decisions over Brettem Kavanaugh, and it would really be an explosive charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hard," Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of those whom she named could verify.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything going to change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what did he do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be held every year in New York, the Global Citizen Festival, which offers a very impressive series of stars and an impressive mission behind the end of world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the actual goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, e-mail world leader, phone calls, or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Global Citizen now 12 years before reaching its goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert really the way to convince them to ask for an action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” - people who feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet, something will change?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by his fans, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the announcement of global leaders of $37 billion commitments and measures that will affect more than 2.25 billion people’s lives by 2030.
In early 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that secured funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
The key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and realizers committed to “aid children to grow in their full potential” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note from social injustice in the form of undernutrition in history,” Ambassador to the Power of Nutrition Project Tracey Ullman said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also noted that after more than 5,000 actions called for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website with a question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as well as big civil rights and movement against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are one of the stars of this year in New York, which will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use a navy for "blocking" that would prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can “if necessary” refer to the navy to prevent Russian energy from falling into the markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s commitment in Syria – especially where it acts to invite a legitimate government – is a goal to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to finance energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the opportunity to make sure, with the help of our navy, that the maritime roads are open and blocked, if necessary, to make sure that their energy is not in the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit group that takes place in the United States as “the voice of energy consumers”.
He compared the approach to Washington and negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically the same.
"The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is more less investment in or replacement of drives," he said, while referring to Russia as a "uniform" player with a fossil fuels-dependent economy.
The statement comes because Trump’s administration is to strengthen exports of its decayed natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump’s government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to resign from the “inadequate” gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 project that, according to Trump, has made from Berlin a “rokaymim” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which has doubled its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s harsh resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of an uncomfortable competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure development and that consumers should have the ability to choose their supplier,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has taken a position from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when the third country is interfering with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to look closely at the 2020 presidential nomination, Massachusetts Senator said.
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election, “the close look” to the presidential nomination.
During the Holyoke Council meeting in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the top female position,” The Hill said.
“After November 6, I will look closely at the presidential nomination.”
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that he “will lead this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am afraid of what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said on Twitter: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters don’t think they should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said that the Senate should not apply, according to a survey from Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
30% would support the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38 percent for the nomination and 48 percent against it.
Other highly developed democratic names, which were discussed in connection with the potential nomination by 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said it was officially decided in January, said Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year after being listed in September in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son passes through, what goes through after his return, can concern other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulse, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest a "loon in the room" and told her son and other war veterans that "they come back a little bit differently, they come back to retreat, they come back and wonder if there is respect for things that their fellow soldiers and flyers, and every other member of the army, give their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence on women, interfering in a report on domestic violence and gun holding in drunkenness, said Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support legal challenges to new US government measures that denied asylum by victims of flooding in front of gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from eighteen states and districts in Washington on Friday issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, NBC said.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace case v. Sessions, which was not disclosed by the American Civil Liberties Organization in August against federal policy.
She said her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang” had been abused of her, but US officials refused her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemalu, producing a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, such as nations facing all over-the-counter gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked the decisions of the 2014 Appeal Senate for Immigrants, allowing illegal immigrants to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine from D.C. said in a statement on Friday that the new measure "ignore decades of state, federal and international law".
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” a short friend said.
Lawyers further argued in brief that the policy that denies immigrants’ entry is harming the U.S. economy and says it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary job”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who fled before domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asyl is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of racial, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement dated 11 June.
Asylum has never been aimed at alleviating all problems - even all serious problems - faced by people every day around the world.
In Palo, where the number of victims has already doubled, runs in search of survivors over time
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly worse and worse.
“It’s very stressful,” said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever boy in the evacuation center in the washed city of Palu.
“Every minute the healthcare will bring more bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their devastated homes, choosing themselves through motivated things and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5-sized earthquake were preserved.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested at Palo's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to persistent severe subsequent tremors.
The tears filled his eyes when he felt that the violent earthquake was shaking with a hotel room on the fifth floor that shared room with his wife and daughter.
“It wasn’t time to save yourself.
I think I was put into the wall cut," Haris told Associated Press and added that his family was in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “shaking” propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertising in a U.S. newspaper dedicated to the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last Wednesday that China’s Daily was paid in the Des Moines register – the state of the largest sales newspapers in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to mix into U.S. Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump’s accusation of attempting to interfere in the US elections indicated what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to develop pressure on China.
While foreign governments are accustomed to submit ads to trade, Beijing and Washington are currently entangled in an escalating trade war that is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
China’s law enforcement sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to win exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term governor Iowy, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"Branstad wrote in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China now doubles this shikan by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press," he said.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a valuable tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Unlike that, in a press stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited unacceptable voices and you will not see any real reflection of unrelated opinions that Chinese might have on the disturbing economic path of China, given that the media belongs to the company “China Communist Party.”
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish the offer” his article, although he did not say which newspapers.
Republicans leave their elections before elections due to debaking with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend a candidate for Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanauga, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the next half-time elections, especially women, would be aware of the response.
The emotions around the case were extremely high, and most Republicans already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell's University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would have been trying to investigate the FBI in the last minute enough to calm the voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget about it tomorrow, and even in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and spokesman of the MoveOn Progressive Group, in the D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters scanned “November is coming!” on a demonstration at the Senate hall, where Republicans who are in charge of the Justice Commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be taking records,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say that it’s already high, it’s true.”
However, this could be higher, especially among the weighty women in the pre-order and younger electors, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not go to the elections.
Even in front of Ford’s public testimony, which has been in detail charged of her sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s candidate, the analyst suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, the opposition could follow.
“It was a confused problem for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, said in the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or final voting or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it’s also about how Republicans managed to do so and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, U.S. Priority Director, a group helping voting Democrats, in a reporting channel.
However, the Americans seem slightly divided into the opinion of whom to believe in the light of the Ford and Kavanaugh witnesses, with slightly more sympathy for the other named.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed or believed by Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed or believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI currently investigates the charges brought by Forde, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that a drunk Kavanaugh attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her her genitals at the party during her study at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventors plan to start a new internet and predict Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he insisted that the goal of the Inrupt project is "World Control."
“We have to do it now,” he said about this startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Disk, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional in the personal online storage of data is that it is entirely on the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal authority through data.”
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to John Bruce, to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project, working on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change in which all their business models are turned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in a Saturday media post that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems that will help protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in a network neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the website,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the Spirit who received the Victorian Cross during the First World War
Hundreds of years have been celebrated since the only spiritual Anglican church won the Victorian Cross as a warrior during the First World War.
Reverend Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him and he never knew he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren uncovered him on Saturday at a festival in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawmakers, Michael Vann, said he was "genically symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's winning death.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Col Vann led his batalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense and strong shooting of fieldworks and ballots.
Later, he reached the first line and led the "highest courage" line forward before he threw himself into the firefighter field and knobled three separate units.
Colonel Vanna killed the German shooter on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do but at the same time something that is humiliating.”
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, after the supervision led by the youth group Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt a great honour that he was able to take part in the supervision, and added that “the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will provide.”
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead to get Peppa pig
Imagine that, you've been waiting for the whole night to watch Bellator 206, just so that the main event is rejected.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts held throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other’s match, watchers in the UK were amazed when the news changed to the Peppa pork order.
Some remained unexpected after watching until early morning hours for the match.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in the streaming for children as “a sure form of the wrong trick.”
“The government’s regulation says that this content is not appropriate at 6:00 a.m., and it is therefore necessary to send children’s schedules,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communications to Bellator after being questioned about this transmission.
"Peppa's work," yes.
Bellator’s president Scott Coker said they would work on the program in order to allow future audiences to be involved in the UK.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, we are likely to handle it,” Cooker said.
“But there is six hours on Sunday morning, and we can’t do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of texts went there and back, and not all were just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, the government could do it.
I promise you that this won't happen again next time.
We reduce it to five matches in place of six – as we do normally – and we tried to keep the promises given to our fans with all our strength and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “minder value” for sexuality
The Olympic water jumper, Tom Daley, says, grew up with a sense of less value for everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to follow success.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, which was presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke loudly about the rights of gays to give to others "hope."
He also said that his chances of becoming a parent were less interested in victory at the Olympics.
Regular long-term moderator Kirsty Young had a few months off due to the disease.
Daley, who appeared in Laverno’s first program as a trigger, said he felt “minder value” than anyone else who grew up at the same time with him because “there wasn’t socially unacceptable to like boys and girls.”
He said, “To date, these feelings of inferiority and differentiation have been real things that have given me strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “Someone,” he said not to disappoint anyone who would possibly find out how it is with his sexuality.
The double holder of the bronze Olympic medal became a high-profile LGBT movement rights fighter and took advantage of his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he answered because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wants to add “hope” to others.
This three-time world champion said he was in love with a man – the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “having achieved unprepared.”
Daley married the owner of Oskara, who is 20 years old, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience this at such a young age – at his first Olympics he was when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said that it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar rises and falls.
In June, the two adopted the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that he had "changed the whole angle of his view."
“If you asked me last year, it would be all in style “I want to get a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more things than the golden Olympic medals.
"My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father did not agree with his death, and the last thing he asked was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in front of him.
“I couldn’t tell him – you won’t be first,” he said.
"I kept him in my hand when he stopped breathing and until the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized he was not insurmountable," he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and gained bronze.
“I knew I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of the sights of our home at the Olympics, I don’t know a better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – Proud by Heather Small – that resonated with him at the beginning of the Olympics and still triggered a dirty skin in it.

Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson would reach a record on Sunday when he played 47, but he would have to leave the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelsona, who played on the event held every two years with a double record, sent Captain Jim Furyk on the lion on Saturday four balls and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the event, as often as it was in the United States, the five-time main winner spent his day in exchange between the deployers and working on the game in a row that he hoped he would fix what he suffered.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct driver, even at the top of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National playground, where a long-lived field is routinely punished by deceased shooters.
And if the golf course is not quite worried about itself, Mickelson faces the precise British Open Francescu Molinarimu champion in the nineth Sunday match, who won all four of his matches this week in the team with New Yorker Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped a quick rise, Mickelson's sword could seem to be totally essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and did not add anything else.
"He fully understands the role he had today, he knocked me on his back, gave me his hand around his shoulders and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“It’s so trusted.
He was a member of the Sun of Slams, and in the past and this week he was so beneficial for these teams.
I couldn't imagine playing two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, like everyone else."
Mickelson surpasses Nick Fald's record in most Western Ryder Cups held on Sunday.
This could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson achieved 18 wins, 20 winners, and seven wins, although Furyk says his presence of the team has brought some insignificant results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes people to make fun and he's a great partner in the team's room," he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the fun following him this week, which was fun to watch.
It gives much more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, an experienced European captain, knows that the great leadership towards the singles of the last days in the Ryder Cup can easily be changed to an uncomfortable ride.
Dane debuted at the 1997 match in Valderra, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-pound mass over the Americans, but they reached a totally narrow victory in the target level.
“You still have to remember that we had a big mask in Valderrama, just as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only narrowly,” Bjorn said on the picture, after watching when 5-3 won in 2018 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf 10 National.
So the history and every member of the team showed me that it's not behind us.
You'll be completely bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all those points are on the table.
We have a goal, and this is to try to get the troop, and we focus on it.
I said I will focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to build on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, pleased with how his players were driving on a complex golf course, added: “I would never do it myself.
Tomorrow another animal is waiting for us.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be prepared and it’s too difficult.
It’s great to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you have to be alone there, your golf player’s capacity is fully verified.
This is a message you have to send to players to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave a partner behind and he must go and get the best out of himself as well.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will take care of his players to play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great returns, when he was part of the winner team in Brooklin, to end as a defeated when Europe reached the "Mediana View".
“I remember every fucking word,” Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, asked, encouraged his players to meet up to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly like in Brooklin, like in Medina.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts significant pressure on those middle matches.
In this way, we set up the assembly and ensure that the boys feel like you know, as if we were supposed to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the attack and build with Rory McIlroy at the top with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, which are other Europeans in the top half.
“I went with that group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said about his single selection.
Germany’s new warship is again delayed
The newest German naval fregate was recognized in 2014 to replace the age-old warships from the era of the Cold War, but will not be available at least another year due to the wrong systems and the snowy coast, local media say.
The operation of the ship leader "Rheinland-Pfalz", a completely new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregates, was now delayed, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing the spokesman's army, for the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to be part of the navy in 2014, but the challenging problems after delivery displeased the fate of this ambitious project.
As a replacement for the Bremen-class old-fashioned fregats, four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will serve, which have already been ordered by the navy in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful division, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistic shoots and some hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to install the latest fregates for up to two years outside the home port.
However, constant delays mean that top sea vessels – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces to the sea – will be obsolete until the time of entering into operation, says Die Zeit.
The famous fregate F125 came into the news last year when the German navy officially refused to launch the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned the ship to the manufacturers after the ship was shipped.
Only few were known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical “software errors and defects on metal elements” failures that would make the warship useless when putting into battle.
The defeats on the software were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will operate a crew of about 120 navals, which is half of the workers needed on the Bremen class fregates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a significant overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the maritime ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000 tons of Rheinland-Pfal ship will be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defects on metal elements, the cost of the entire project is also a problem – including crew training.
It is said that from the original €2.2 billion, the price has increased to €3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest fregatas have gained importance especially in light of recent warnings that the German naval power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, confirmed that the naval army actually “is coming ships capable of invasion.”
The representative noted that the problems were continuously acquired because the old vessels were removed from the operation, but no replacement was provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregats were able to become part of the naval equipment.
National Trust listens to the Secret Life of Netopyers
On the headquarters of netopyers in Scotland high school, new research is undertaken to reveal how netopyers use the landscape in hunting food.
There is hope that finding research will bring new light on the behaviour of unique flyers and help to manage future activities to preserve this species.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be monitored by the stars and the smallest and most brown long and watery Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this non-touching residence, which will monitor the activities of non-touchers throughout the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Professional audio analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of calls of netopyers and what the individual species do.
Then a map of habitat and a report will be issued that will create a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for the netops and how individual species use them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of living habitat management work, such as the creation of turkeys, and the best practice in maintaining forested areas for neoprene and other related species.
The population of Scotland and the whole of the UK in the past centuries have remained largely.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
The risk may also be wind turbines and lighting, as well as falls on mosquitoes and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
In fact, the netopics are not blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, their ears are more useful in hunting than their eyes.
They use a thorough echo-location technique to deploy brochures and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the netops very seriously.
It has trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, colonies controls and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even founded the first and only reserved non-stop booking in the headquarters of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten types of non-stop in Scotland.
David Thompson’s headquarters says it’s an ideal area for them.
“We have a great area in Threave here,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there are still too many things that we don’t know about non-goods, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It emphasizes the importance of controlling netops before the start of maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of a single mother's snake can kill up to 400 females and youths, which can destroy the entire local population.
Netopyers are protecting and are illegal to kill them, torture, ruin or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish CEO of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to add hand to work and help.
She said, "We have to learn a lot about our species and many species that we don't know how their populations can do so."
Ronaldo refuses allegations of rape and his lawyers are trying to accuse German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape for “fake news” and said that people “will see” themselves using his name.
His lawyers are about to accuse the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who informed of these charges.
This Portuguese and the Juventus attacker was accused of raped Kathryn Mayorgy in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later paid $375 000 to quiet the case, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the release of the charges, Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers in a live video on Instagram and called the information “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news,” said the five-time award holder of the Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want to live in my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but it's part of their work.
“I’m happy and I’m okay,” the player said with a smile.
According to the Reuters agency, lawyers are planning to complain about the Der Spiegel newspaper of unfaithful allegations that have called it "unacceptable notice of suspicion in a private area."
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for “moral damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of breach, which is probably one of the most serious breach of personal rights in recent times.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel apartment and at the Las Vegas casino.
After a meeting in the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were allegedly returned to the game, where it was allegedly raped by the documentation filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell down after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "loaded" and "one percent" disappointed.
In the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but he was consensual.
Mayorga also declares she went to police and left to take pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extra-social settlement because she was “fearing the defeat” and fearing “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to restore the procedure because the alleged incident is still traumatised.
Ronald was accused of a step-by-step attack on the Real Madrid club in Manchester United and this summer he bought him for €100 million from the famous Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Britain will always regret the loss of car manufacturers
"The UK will "will regret forever" if after Brexit it comes to its status as a world leader in automotive production," said Greg Clark's secretary.
He added that it was “anxious” that the Toyota UK car told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
“A deal is necessary,” Clark said.
The Japanese car said the impact of delay on the borders in the event that a Brexit agreement is not concluded may cost jobs.
In Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured last year, nearly 150,000 cars were manufactured, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
“I think that if Britain suddenly left the EU by the end of March, we would stop producing in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, spread fears of leaving the EU without an agreement as to the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini car production race in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers consider to be the risks for the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “time delivery”, while parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU are delivered for cars made to order within 37 minutes.
If the UK would leave the EU on March 29 without an agreement, it could have been a border violation, which could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts, according to the industry.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in the Derbyshire factory in stock, the company said, which would result in a drop in production.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plans for restoring future relations with the EU are "calibrated precisely so that these border controls are not under way."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best store that, as I say, will allow not only the current success but also the capability of this opportunity," BBC Radio 4's Today said.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must absolutely be able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but in the long term it warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually be at work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the trade fair, said that members of the trade organisation are increasingly worried: “I have experience that as soon as these places disappear, they will never return again.
The spokesman said: “We have set a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House said.
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with General Rosenstein’s representative attorney, Rod Rosenstein, could be “released for another week,” as he continues to fight for the position of Supreme Judge with Bret Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein learns about the work of the Special Council Robert Mueller, who examines interventions in Russian elections, ties between Trump’s branches and Russia and possible judicial obstructions by the president.
Whether Trump releases the representative of the general power and thus threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s clips have been shaking for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein had discussed the wearing of a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of meeting the president through Appendix 25.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House surrounded by news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was at the time at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City.
Trump stated that Rosenstein wouldn't "prefer" to go away, but then a meeting was delayed to stop hearing the Senate's court committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual disturbance, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI a weekly investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh, delaying the plenary vote of the Senate again.
Trump’s press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared in Fox Channel news on Sunday.
Asked at a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set, this week may be, maybe a further week’s move will be needed, taking into account everything else that is happening at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and always communicate the current information to the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference with the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by averaging to the “theatre” of television reporters, although she said, “I disagree with the fact that they will go out.”
She later suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," he added, without giving evidence. "We looked at those numbers."
“The conference will continue,” Sanders said, but “if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the president directly, it would certainly be better than conversations with me.
“We’ve tried it and you’ve seen that we’ve been doing it in the last few weeks and that a press conference will take place where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high representatives.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why he was with his relaxed and sometimes strange in front of the gathering journalists.
Health Ministry writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to avoid fear of Brexit
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to SMEs not even six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to deal with the costs of requests for EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in a letter: “The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continue last summer, and are aimed at the expected decisions this year in autumn.
However, the British government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible scenario of withdrawal without agreement.
I know that it must be a very calming time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to make sure again how much I appreciate the contributions of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Collegates from all over the EU and outside of the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and the communities we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our challenging desire is to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie takes an emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee's Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie took an emergency surgery after he suffered head injury in a Saturday 31-27 defeat by Vanderbilt Commodores's rival, Mike Organ from Tennessee said.
Tennessee's chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and healthcare professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side lines and then put it on the vessel and prepared for further evaluation.
Tennessee official Chrisz Harris told WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had a surgical surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the injury type/scale are still available" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red shirt man, performs the first season for the state of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
Before ending the game on Saturday, he had five total steps, which means a total of 18 steps in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher real estate tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher real estate tax when buying real estate in the UK, while money will also be used to help homeless under new Tory plans
This act will neutralize Corbyn’s success, aimed at attracting young voters
Increasing real estate tax liability will apply to persons who do not pay tax in the UK
State cash increase is expected by £120 million a year – to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay higher real estate tax when buying a real estate in the UK, while money will be used to help homeless people.
This action will be taken as a attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s casting to attract young voters with the oath to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
Increasing real estate tax will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while money will further strengthen the government’s efforts to fight sleeping without a roof over their heads.
The additional fee, in addition to the current obligation of real estate tax payments, including higher levels imposed two years ago in other houses and purchases for rent purposes, may reach up to 3%.
It is assumed that the funds will be increased up to £120 million a year in the state cash.
According to estimates, a newly built real estate in London is buying 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of the UK, which eliminates the price and makes it easier for those who buy for the first time to get to the number of homes.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “the city of spirits” just because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
New principles appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in real estate tax to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding high real estate prices by taking the land but not using it, and urged Ms. May to take off quotas from affordable homes to fix the "house limit" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn has announced the appeal of a series of proposed housing reforms, including the lease management and the ending of "unexpected" transfers.
He also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
May said: “I said last year that I want to dedicate my efforts as a prime minister to restore the British dream – that every new generation has a better life.
This means correcting our damaged real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it can’t be right to make it easy for entities not living in the UK and for foreign companies to buy homes as well as hard-working residents of the UK.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and sleeping without a roof over the head is too real.”
Jack Ross: “My highest ambition is to drive Scotland”
Sunderland’s chief Jack Ross says his “highest ambition” becomes Scotland’s manager at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scotch is excited to challenge the restoration of the Northeastern Club, which currently ranks third in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after he brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B score and it was that," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up by watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and that’s always something that attracts me back.
This would only be a chance if I had been successful in the leadership of the club.”
Ross's predecessors in the role of Sunderland managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ex-Chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any worries about the follow-up of such names in such a large club when he had previously rejected the predecessors of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success would be the question for me at the time if I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it is certainly part of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him back there, but I’d probably seem successful if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a career in leadership for three years, before acting as an assistant boss in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the third group and transformed St Mirren from the start of the turnover into the winner of the championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he ever had players in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably real crossroads," he recalls the time he grew up with Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership is more than playing for me.
It sounds weird, because I was good, I earned well and enjoyed a reasonable height.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you need to go through a week.
I still go through them from the point of view of stress and pressure of the work, but I just feel good in leadership.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel like I feel the most in my skin in my whole adult life now.”

The study found that the great time on the door is Saturday at 17:30 pm
The summer wave of the veterans increased British household revenues with difficulties, but increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
The numbers show that hosts and bar groups recorded a sales rise by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenue decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a CGA consultant, said: “Stable sunlight and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup indicated that in July it followed a similar formula as in previous June, when the host’s visit increased by 2.8%, but restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant markets by 1.8% in June was still worse.
The houses and bars that attract drinks have yet to lead the strongest like the restaurant has worsened.
The teams whose main markets are from food, the sun also suffered, although not as dramatic as restaurants operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent for a month, while food sales declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, an analytical company for recreational activities and hospitality, said: “These results are the continuation of a trend that lasts since the end of April.
The weather and influence of significant social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chain continues to fight, although an annual drop in sales by 4.8% will be particularly painful in light of current cost pressures.
The long hot summer cannot be worse for business operators of food attraction, and the time will indicate whether the mildest temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much comfort.”
The overall growth of sales in houses and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.

Each fifth child has a secret account on social networks that hides from parents.
Each fifth child – at the age of only 11 – has a secret social media account, which hides from parents and pedagogy, shows research.
Research among 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "false Instagram pages"
Reports have increased concerns about sexual content being published
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that parents know about.
Each fifth child – at the age of only 11 – creates accounts on social networks that they hide before their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” in which photos are shared.
Reports indicate concerns that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of students stated that they have a “main” account that parents know about, and at the same time have a private account.
One mother who hit her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found her puberty calls others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by the Digital Awareness Agency UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools has shown that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, half admitting they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worried that he has so many teenages’ attempts to create online spaces where their parents and pedagogs can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be “the voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most awarded light athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in the leadership of sport as those who will benefit from its far-reaching international experiences over the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are sure that it will be significantly beneficial for the athlete in Scotland when he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I’m excited to be a voice of athletes and I hope I’ll be really beneficial and help to run sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters at the Atlantic Olympics in 1996, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transitional ishemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if I could be healed or to what extent.
It’s exhausting, but I managed to complete healing, again learned to walk and today I can handle exercise!

The company involved in the production of cutters has distributed online opinions with advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows.
As part of the marketplace of “first silent portable cutters in the world”, Envi’s consumer technology company released a music video with a surplus showing the freedom that the new cutter gives breastfeeding mothers.
The four real mothers dance in a doll full of cows on a song with the text: "Yes, I'm going to see, but you don't see any eggs" and "If you haven't noticed that I don't have chests, there are my breasts here."
The board continues: "Pump, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, drink my sweet milk."
However, the advertising that was published on the company’s Facebook page has created an online controversial response.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of which pointed out that it throws light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“The very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising on this product.
As we have to be pregnant and childbirth in order to give milk, but children are taken a few days after childbirth,” said one of the commentators.

Another comment: “It is understandably traumatic for the mother and the child.
But yes, why don’t you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who leave their children?”
Someone else added, “This advertisement is completely out.”
They also appeared to those who defended the advertisement, while one woman admitted that the song was considered “infective”.
“I think it’s a genial idea.
I'd have a pump if I'd still crawl.
I feel exactly like a cow when I go out.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but it's about it.
It's a good product," one user wrote.
She added: “It’s a fun advertising aimed at mothers who take milk (often at work or toilet) and feel like “cows”.
It’s not an advertisement that should praise or curse the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that everyone dances with discrete cuts hidden under the breast.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie is completely quiet, has no wires or cages and is beautifully hiding in the breasts, so women give freedom of movement, the ability to hold the child and even walk while leaving.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added a comment: “Elvie is a revolutionary product that deserves a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and breast-feeding chickens, we wanted to indicate the removal of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable sense of freedom that a new removal will ensure.
This isn't the first time Elvie's kidnapper came to the confession.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski, who used the product, appeared on the mould.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a fixed camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has steadily increased despite the fact that the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, particularly because the hard rhetoric and principles imposed by Trump’s administration have facilitated the placement of children with accompanying.
Most of the accompanying immigrants were traditionally composed of immigrants without documents, who were afraid of threatening to stay in the country, so they claimed that they belonged to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior official at the immigration and customs department, confirmed by Congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people who requested the status of escorts of minors alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of the home sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them,” Mr. Albence said.
According to asylum facilities employees, representatives in an effort to deal more quickly with children’s issues have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be submitted before the court within a month prior to detention, instead of previous standard 60 days.
Many appear through calls within the video conference instead of personally declaring their case as a legal status for the immigrant judge.
Those who do not have the right to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in care, the more likely the child is to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to an explosion of crash or escape attempts, asylum workers claim and report from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say that these concerns are increased in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs of the child’s suffering, more likely unnoticed, just due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a fixed camp without enough time dedicated to emotional preparation or separation with friends could cause a trauma that many children are already fighting.
Syria announces that they will immediately download U.S., French and Turkish “occupational components”
During the speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called after the return of Syrian refugees, although the eighth year of war in the country.
Moual, who is also the prime minister, said that foreign forces in Syria are illegal, under the threat of fighting against terrorism, and that "it will be charged accordingly."
"They must immediately and unconditionally give up," he said at the meeting.
"The war against terrorism in Syria has almost ended," Moualem said, and more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have gone home.
He said Damascus would continue to fight “in this holy battle until we get rid of all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreigners.”
The United States has about 2,000 units in Syria, primarily training the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of war.
When issued refugees, Moual said they had good return conditions for them and accused “some Western countries” of “the spread of unrational concerns” that caused refugees not to want to return.
“We have called for international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no recovery assistance for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last attack at Idlib has created an opportunity to move further in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the major attack of the Syrian forces protected by Russia on a province where there are three million people.
However, Moualem pointed out that the deal has "clearly specified final deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front organization with a link to Al-Qaeda, who will "release."
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to propose a constitution for Syria and to expose the road to elections will soon be held.
Moual laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted to "the control of existing constitutional articles" and issued warnings before entry.
Why Trump Wins in the Second Period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in the next 2020 elections, if, as much liberal observers may hope, the charges and scandals of his office as president would not end.
In such a case, it would certainly be “the most dramatic final of the presidential period in history!”
So far there are no signs of fatigue from followers.
Since 2014, the main broadcast time tracking has doubled to 1.05 million to CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average watching of 2.4 million in the main broadcasting time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC increased watching on cable TV to 3.5 million watching main night news.
“It’s a jealousy that people are fooling because it’s something that we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, an operator of the “Designed Survivor” series at ABC’s cabinet secretary, who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovellová, an experienced author of comedy and series "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
It reminds me of a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? asked
"He said, 'Because it's funny with him,' said Ms Scovell to me.
It's the importance of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that takes place in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether immigrant families can reconnect and for the benefit of the global economy.

Money out to the sharpest domestic race mid-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania has experienced an attack of finances thanks to the reorganization of the congress districts generated by two office holders in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the transformation of Pittsburgh County by the Democratic District Republican Conor Lamb, who won another district in the special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another office holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly covers the new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania made an opinion in January that the ancient districts were inestimably distributed in the interests of Republicans, maps were redesigned.
The race in the new 17th district started a sharp financial gap between the financial sectors of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the following March special elections to the 18th Congress district.
This chair has been occupied by the Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political experts give the Democrats a mild surplus.
America plans to punish Salvador for China's support, then resign
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under the mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners were legally expelled by Trump’s organizational team.
Representatives of the foreign ministry have decided to appeal to U.S. diplomatic mission directors from Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions not to further recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the ministry in a statement issued earlier this month.
But fines were considered only against Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million of U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial aid and focused on visa limitation, would be painful for the country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With continuing internal negotiations, North American and Central American representatives have delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity based on similar negotiations from the previous year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from migrating to the United States.
But by mid-September, the chief executives explained that they wanted to continue the negotiations and effectively end any considered penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the solution of the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, in the context of a signal that the administration puts on negotiations, diplomats said.
And three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having new news from Washington.
The White House spokeswoman, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to the internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their resources have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to government executive and also spoken under the condition of anonymity.
Study History
A definitive rack can be Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible defence of Mr. Trump in the exercise of law, which is now a lot of evidence in public records.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller allegedly turns to whether Mr. Trump’s campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If an exchange of parties occurred in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to sign up for responsibility before this authority, as he is preparing to re-present before the voters, and in the end he would probably expect a court made up of his colleagues.
That's a whole series of "if", and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - as with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will take.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to organize a gun against Hitler, just enough to build and support him in Munich, Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid long-term years of full blood prolation that followed.
History turns around such critical moments that accelerate or slow the slowing down of democracy.
The Americans are now facing several similar critical moments.
What shall we do if Mr. Trump expels the Deputy Prosecutor General Rode Rosenstein, the man who leads the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been injured since the report announced that last year he proposed secretly to record the president and speculated that he wasn't in a health condition to hold the president's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times versions are unprecedented.
“How can we react if F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh’s newly requested investigation is not complete or fair – or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite the convincing charges of sexual assault and cruel prosecution?
And most importantly, are we going to vote for Congress in the middle of the term of office, which will judge Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe that we won't sit, thanks to the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn candles on the table with a shaft.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about confrontation with Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday hosts Rapid Vienna with the awareness that the victory over Rakušany would give them great hope for the G Group of the European League in the early days of this month after an impressive remit in Spain at the Villarreal Square.
The knee injury prevented backpacker Graham Dorrans from appearing on the ground for the first time in the season until 2-2 with Villarrealem. However, Rangers believe that the result can be used as a reflective mouse for larger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the battle with the belief that we could do something, and we took a point.
Maybe we could have multiplied it at the end, but in general, the remit was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we improved and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we will get three points, but it will be difficult because they have played a good result in the last match, but with the viewers behind the back, I'm sure we can squeeze and get it well.
Last year it was quite difficult, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I feel very good about it.
The team is strong and the boys really enjoy it, the training is fine as well.
I hope we're going to get into it right now, we're going to put it in front of last season and we're going to be successful."
Women are worried about savings on retirement
Although the participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in a national study said they had discussed the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't decide to talk about it with him," explains Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Company.
You can start this way.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care unless you reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and family, check where and how to take care because these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Invite your financial adviser: The adviser can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be funded using traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash insurance that will help you pay these expenses, or using your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles as long as it goes.
Determine a healthcare representative, which will be a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that doctors comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate yourself.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
You will choose a confidential person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are played if you are not eligible for this.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your old parent necessarily needs medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his drugs and allergies?
Write these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“In the game, not just finances, but, for example, how are the treatment doctors called?” asked Martin.
“Where are the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready for your hand.”
A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from the airplane.
When the man came back to his house on a walk after the night, a few shots shot him out of the air.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in her chest, stomach and hands.
Police described the shooting that took place around 2:30 p.m. as a "appropriate act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not threatening the lives and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died of severe earthquakes and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, the number of victims is expected to rise.
As communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Dongal Regiment, which is a region north of Palu, closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palo after the disaster was erupted.
Here are a few key facts about the city of Palu and the regent of Donggal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow coastline on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary of the emergence of earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a regent that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the northern west of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regentity, the administrative region under the provinces, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, particularly in the coastal region of Dongguan.
In the province there is also significant nickel mining, but it focuses primarily on Morowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggal have already reached the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Dongalia in 1996 when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismical Pacific Fire Circle and regularly occurs earthquakes here.
Here is a list of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: Great earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunami, which hit 14 countries and prepared for the lives of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: The series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of the Indonesian largest island of Java and caused tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-power earthquake attacked one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra and caused tsunamis at a height of 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and prepared for the lives of about 300 people.
2016: Light earthquake attacked Pidie Jaya's regent in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic because it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunami from 2004.
This time no tsunami was formed, but more than 100 died due to falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake attacked Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for an attack charge.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, a 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, disruption of reports of domestic violence and prevention of arrest.
When, according to a police report, his female friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin picked up her phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held on an uninsured bond of $500, according to KTUU.
According to a network report, he appeared to the court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt “decisively innocent” when asked for a statement.
Palin faces three A-class crimes, which means it can be sentenced to a year of freedom withdrawal and to a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was accused of an infringement of class B, which was sentenced to one-day jail and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has to face a criminal statement.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged police attack reported his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently in the Alaska court for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disruption of reports of domestic violence and arms holding under the influence of intimidating substances associated with the incident.
He allegedly hit his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of war veterans in 2016 when her son’s violent behaviour linked to a posttraumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake occurred on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are out of traffic and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit a part of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There were videos on social media showing the moment of defeat.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu when tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
The federal prosecutor in New York demands death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people, is an exceptional penalty that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was allegedly attacked on a bicycle along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, using a rented truck Home Depot, which hits pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries - so the conditions of the intention to grant the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to judicial documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court accused Saipov of 22 criminal offences, including, for example, charges of murder in favor of elicitation that federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preparation", claims the prosecutors and describe the way Saipo's actions were carried out, such as abusive, cruel and reverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to Dieg Enrique Angelini, Nicholase Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendozy and Alejandra Damiana Pagnucca."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York was last sentenced to death.
The accused Khalid Barnes was sentenced to murder of two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to a lifetime withdrawal of freedom in September 2009.
The last death sentence was actually carried out in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death, which proved to be conspired to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War for two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sitting on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed minimal regrets according to judicial documents within the days and months following the attack.
Police said he felt good for what he did.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by watching the videos of the Islamic State on the phone to commit the attack.
Police also reported that they also requested the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "opportunly disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutors.
“We are convinced that the decision to demand death penalty instead of accepting guilt confession and sentence to life without the possibility of release only extends the trauma from these events to anyone involved,” Patton said.
The team of Saipov defenders had previously asked the applicants not to demand death penalty.
The Conservative Party should be entrusted with negotiations on Brexit NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the people’s army” during the protest at the Conservative Party’s conference today.
The former leader of the United Kingdom’s independence party stated that politicians must “feel pressure” by the Eurosceptics – as one of their own Members, Theresa May, proposed, should conduct negotiations with the EU just he.
The Conservative Director, Peter Bone, declared that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if he would be a secretary for Brexit, Mr. Farage.
But the problem Mrs. May faced when reassuring its ranks, where he is deeply disrupted, has still highlighted the conservatives fighting for the EU's reservoirs who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister seeks to maintain its compromise plan from Chequers in the course of the attacks of Brexit, Brexit, Union settlement and the EU itself.
The allies continue to try to deal with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to go to Chequers.
He proposed to Farage to become a representative and to be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in front of us, we would be out of here today,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we have to get out of Chequers.”
In order to show his opposition to the EU, he said, "We have not fought the world wars so we have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected proposals that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that British citizens would change their opinion and want to continue is totally clear.”
Conservative Brexit deputy Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the move, told reporters: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular in the wide public, the opposition will not vote for it and will not like it by members of our party or our activists who currently fill the streets to be elected at all.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In an acute report for Mrs May, he says, "The Prime Ministers will hold their place when they keep the promises."
Farage stated that conservative politicians must be “sufficient in an unpleasant situation” if they wish to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They try to betray Brexit and we’re standing here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you.’”
In the report he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of the Brexit betray, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilising the army of the people of this country, which has ensured our victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of Britain, which is ruling itself.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the settlement in the Union held Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had the transparency of the Conservatives against Brexit after the end of the weekend’s operation of the party.
Lord Adonis labourist laughed at the Conservatives because of the security issues of the party's application after the conference.
“This is people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a whole frase.
“There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘expectedly think’ of a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after November’s elections, she would “recognize the nomination for the presidential election.”
Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future on Saturday at a municipality in the West Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, is trying to reelection in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She felt at the center of speculation that she could build Trump in 2020.
The action on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters at the mayor since Trump met in the office.
One of the participants asked her whether it was planned to be the president’s office.
Warren said it was time for women to get to Washington and repair our broken government, meaning that the woman is at the top.
He was arrested for Simse shooting from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect of the Friday shooting of LSU's basketball player Wayd Simse.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video was released from a Friday shooting request for the identification of the man captured on the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday morning hours near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shotgun injury that didn't match life," police officer Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was heard and admitted that he was moving on the site of the crime, had a gun, and also admitted the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and imprisoned at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The six-foot and six-inch high Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, 10 of which were in the previous season, and the average had 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion when his team directed him to win Sebastian Vette
At the moment when Valtteri Bottas finished in Lewis Hamilton's Saturday qualification, it was clear that Mercedes's team directed will play a major role in the race.
From the position field, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettela to attack the team partner.
Vettel was the first to enter the depot and let Hamilton run the cars around the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider went to the deport for a bike later and ranked after the departure for Vettela, but Hamilton went ahead and in a narrow battle, the Ferrari rider had to leave the inner road free so that he could defend himself in the third round after a double manpower.
Max Verstappen dropped out of the rear of the bike field, and at the end of the first wheel he was driving on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race because he held his original tyres as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and could hire Kimim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he entered the dep at the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri spent the whole weekend a great job, and when he got an order, he kept himself as a perfect gentleman.
The team has brought a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was really a bad word of the body.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday’s meeting for the fact that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court’s candidate of Bret Kavanaugh’s sexual assault.
During the speech at the meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Commission, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate indicates that people are "bad and contradictory and profane."
“The only thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see that anger when you see those people being angry, evil, rebellious and foolish,” he said.
“When you look at the publication and publication, they will say to you, ‘Ah, I did not.’
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you get that escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document - "ah,ah,ah,ah,ah?
Oh, no.
Not published."
Well, wait a minute.
“No, that’s not,” he added, simulating the Senate.
Feinstein sent Ford's letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information escaped early in September, but Feinstein refused to escape from its office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s orders, nor did I disclose the information about the case,” said Feinstein’s knife, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me.
However, according to her words, he did not believe the president who expressed himself at the meeting on Saturday evening: “I tell you that this is seriously a bad word of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but at any rate it's the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
The President continues to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court judge whose three women were accused of sexual disturbance, pointing out that Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
“They are committed to taking too much back any available resources.
You can see that foolishness, this obstacle, it doesn't matter who they will hurt who they have to enter into the country to get back to power and to the cormidal," the president said in a statement.
Elit League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two times for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed the Friday loss in the Elit League against Belfast Giants win in the Saturday tournament in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
Giants soon took over two-branch leadership thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to balance their homes before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard then compared Dundee again, while two doors of Lukase Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was a third defeat in the Elit League in the season for Adam Keefe's team, who managed to defeat 2-1 on Friday in Belfast Dundee.
Both teams met in the fourth season, all three previous matches were managed by Giants players.
Dwyer's first gate came at the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford joined Beauvillie's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back to the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first pause only when he recorded his second goal at the end of the first third.
The homes were rebuilt, and Bouchard was able to match the goal of the match at 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcoran's joint work helped Nielsen later in the second quarter to overcome Dundee's leadership for the first time in the match, and the same player secured the leadership of his team in the middle of the final quarter.
Giants, now losing the fourth of the last five matches, will play another match on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic leader died to allow hundreds of people on board aircraft to escape earthquake
The leader of the air traffic in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died when he watched to manage to fly safely with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many of them disappeared after the Sulawesi island threw a large earthquake that caused tsunami on Friday.
Strong subsequent storms invaded the area and many people remained imprisoned in the busy town of Palu.
But although the colleagues of Anthonius Gunawana Agunga fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in a wild denied control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to ensure that the flight Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the rain, could fly safely.
Then he jumped from the ruling tower down when he thought he was sitting.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, spokeswoman, Johannes Sirait, told the Australian TV channel ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter transport from Balikpanan to Kalimantan, which was transferred to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart is broken by this message,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands, and the agency responsible for disaster-solving said that access to cities of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of deaths is increasing, because many bodies are still unreleased and many of them have not been rescued,” said Nugro’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo.
The waves in the devastated Palo reach up to six meters of height. In the city, mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are importing assistance and supplies to affected places.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News station: “Every minute the ambulance brings other bodies here.
There is a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find in the place.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military components: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said the CNN station.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people were killed.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight in a lagoon on one of the micronean islands in the Pacific stated that one person was missing, initially stating that all passengers and crew reading a total of 47 people were safely evacuated from the hot airplane.
Air Niugini said she was unable to find a single passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in search of a lost man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details on this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crews after the aircraft got into the water when attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and all of them were in a stabilized state.
What caused an accident and the exact trace of the event remains unclear.
The U.S. Airline and Navy reported that the aircraft had arrived in the lagoon before the landing route.
Some witnesses thought that the plane wanted the road.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very small height.
“It was very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and others managed to get water through a deep belt to the emergency easts of the heating plane.
He also stated that the staff panicked and shouted, and that he himself suffered mild injuries on his head.
The U.S. Navy said navals who worked near the harbour mills have helped rescue by means of an inundation vessel transported by passengers on the coast before the aircraft dropped into a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people have died in PNG registered aircraft accidents, but no accidents have occurred at Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned for live
The prosecution on Saturday ended its speech in this case, in which a man is repeatedly sentenced to death for a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice in person of its analyst, Paul Rowletta, testified a few hours and provided expertise in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the court planned the scenario as he used recordings from the mobile phone of 29 accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessicy Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received localization data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was in Chambers’ death in the evening, which was contrary to his previous statement, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When, based on the data from the mobile phone, it was proven that he spent the night with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and proved that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford car that night, Sanford said that "that's because my truck was in Nashville that night."
Another failure was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers about two weeks on the day she died.
However, the records from the mobile phone suggest that the two of them were known for just a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He has completely removed it from his life," said Hale.
Defence starts its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be brought before the court later on the same day.

Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions on this genre by filling up its music with positive messages.
The High Breed chapel from Bristol claims that the hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and social problems.
They want to return to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently met with the revival thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another Black?!
A NY educator complains about a pair of extortion for a “racial” text message
An educator in New York complains for a pair of discrimination after receiving a wrongly sent text message from his mother, in which she was called a "more black" text message.
The couple refused to be racists and compared the complaint with the "discrimination".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was terrified when the first day of work in 2016 found that the new educator of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEEÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉ ÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉ
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her drink twice.
When she understood her faux passport, Plasco-Flaxman's "anxiety" was thrown out of Maurice and stated that she was just leaving an Afro-American educator who worked really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a wage for one job and was sent to Uber home.
Maurice now complains about compensation for withdrawal from work and demands a $350 compensation per day for a six-month commitment for which she was hired at the beginning, even without a contract.
“I want to show them that this does not happen,” Post said on Friday, and added, “I know that it is discrimination.”
However, the two returned the attack with the fact that they were not racists, but that Maurice’s termination of employment was an appropriate measure because they were afraid that they would no longer be able to believe her after that injury.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
It is definitely not a racist.
“We are not racists,” said her husband, Joel Plasco, in the Post.
"But would you give your child into the hands of someone to whom you behaved, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
But let's go."
Plasco resembled a complaint about "demonstration" and stated that his wife only cared for a two-month-old child and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Will you drive someone like that?
It’s not a good thing at all,” said the investment banker.
Although the court continues to last, the court on social media very quickly condemned the couple for their behaviour and logic.
Publishers of the story about the bear Paddington feared that readers would not identify with the speaking bear, showing the latest reports
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said to the reporter: “It’s hard to feel the situation of someone who reads it for the first time, even before publishing it.
It’s very funny to know this now when we already know the huge success of the bear Paddington.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before leaving him to inspire to write a child book about a small plywood bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added to the 60th anniversary of the publication of a book, which became a "small" in the last year after his death.
To Paddington, whom she describes as a “very important member of her family,” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was never exalted," she said.
“But since Paddington was such a real character for him, it was as if you had a child who achieved something that you can really be proud of.
I think Paddington's success was looking at this.
Although it was his only creation and imagination, he always tried to assign all successes only to Paddington.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He regularly called me to tell me that it's really bad and that he doesn't expect it to get out of it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“I had a phone call from Nada, where she told me she would die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications given to her to keep her heart walking, slowly lost her effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly afterwards and it was as if everything had been closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in my mind."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now struggling with the loss of her daughter, has entered the plane together with other passengers, without revealing what difficult trial she is going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head blowing, and my tears fell on my faces all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the flight when I felt a stunning understanding to Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how I could love her.”
Trucking women send out viewers to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey send a Welsh Bridge viewer with inspiration messages and telephone numbers that people can search for support.
The son of Mrs. Tyler Davis was only 13 when he began to suffer from depression and as a result he died at the age of 18.
“I wouldn’t want any other parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, a 45-year-old and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented young cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was able to illuminate every room.”
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his uncle’s body after he married his life.
Mrs. Davis says, "I am constantly worried how this will affect his life."
Mrs. Davis proposed a viewer, “to inform people that they are available to people who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don’t sit down – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, the flying girlfriend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, shortly after the death of his mother.
“Nothing told me to feel at the bottom or depressed, nothing at all,” she explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst of all on the Day of Judgment – when children opened gifts, neither looked at them, nothing.
She stated that her partner’s death was a tremendous trauma for them, but that she had to get through it gradually: “This thing can do a whole hole in the family.
It broke us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Bret Kavanaugh’s future depends on how the FBI starts its investigation
“I thought we could actually get something that we wanted – a time-limited investigation, with a limited extent – we could bring a little unity into it,” Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would “depart” because both sides would come up after a party party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-time.
The elections in the middle of the election period are only five weeks away from us, November 6, and if the Republicans take it badly, it will lead to their substantial weakening in their attempts to appeal the man to the position in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbyed with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI makes its report?
The Senate will vote on it and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Miku Pence to break the remit and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees after Kima "pleased"
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea declined seven years ago since the beginning of Kim Chong-Una government, South Korean lawyer said.
Byeong-seug, quoted data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said 1127 refugees had occurred in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further said that the border controls between North Korea and China should be stricter and higher rates required by the cross-border farmers.
Pchjongjang did not make any public statements.
Today, a large majority of North African refugees are offering South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them run through China, with which North Korea has the longest border, and it is easier to cross it than in a severely protected demilitarised band (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China regards refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often force them to repatriate.
Relations between North and South – which are technically still in a state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pchjongjang to talk about suspended denuclearization negotiations.
This took place in the historical June meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the U.S. on Saturday that there was no progress in the issue of sanctions.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to unarmed ourselves unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of a democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, "hysterical" and stated that it is not suitable for service at the Supreme Court thanks to its temperament.
Pelosi made this note in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help myself, but if any woman ever presented such a theatre, they would call it “hysterical,” Pelosi said in a response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday statement before the Senate court committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all allegations of being sexually attacked by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when both were still puberty age.
During his initial speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and breathing in negotiating about his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the committee and said that their accusations against him were a "gross and coordinated attack" organized liberals who failed to transfer through Hillary Clinton's breakthrough in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was predetermined against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he rejected Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether he would try to appeal Kavanaugh in the case of his confirmation, even if Democrats would win a majority of representatives in the House.
“I’ll tell you this – if Congress does not tell the truth, then it is not only eligible to work at the Supreme Court but also at the court at which it works now,” Pelosis said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she had concerns about Kavanaugh's potential revenue in court during the law of acceptable care or Roe vs. Wade because it is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing of the previous confirmation in the function, Kavanaugh avoided answers to the question of whether he would revoke a decision from the Supreme Court.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, predetermined person to come to court and expect us to just say, ‘Yeye, that’s wonderful,” Pelosiová said.
And women have to rule it.
After words, months, and years, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, right?”
She continues: “A woman who made a director somewhere and who told me that she also was crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique. That means that when she was angry and began to cry, she told the person she was talking to, “You might think I was crying because I am angry.
But I have anger."
And so she continued to do it.
And I think it's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partially because they are incomprehensible.
One of my most living memories comes from my first job, where I worked in a office where men dominated. One time I expressed my unexplained wrath crying there. But the elderly, always a cold manager, I've always been a little worried, caught me up on my neck and put me on the throat.
“Don’t show them you’re crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to get you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested at a non-marriage affair on board Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential nomination.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” she laughed at me after 30 years.
“There were seven more candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Paintings."
Since the campaign has been running for a long time, she has failed to take a step in getting contributions, so she has committed not to go into the match unless she gets $2 million on contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would give her only $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she reported that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – such as expressing gratitude to people who supported it, frustration with a system that made her harder to gain money and focus on voters rather than on delegates and from resentment over sexism.
“You might think I was nervous,” said Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“And maybe you’d think my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they might write to me on a small stone.
"Place"?
Why China-American Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The introduction of the trade war between the U.S. and China was alarming, and although the battle is not far off, according to experts, a long-term trade between countries is beneficial to Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning this year by showing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
However, most of the most significant escalations saw the world’s light this week, when new tariffs on goods were announced for $200 billion (£150 billion), which is practically the taxation of half the trade exports from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded every time, by introducing tariffs to five to ten percent of 60 billion U.S. goods imports.
China has tried to pay the U.S. for the same coins, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will fall in the knees.
Even if China wants Washington to return to its original railroads, it would mean resigning from its demands, but public submission to U.S. demands would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Xin-pchinga.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long term as it would reduce the mutual dependence of these two economies.
“Scientific is that Washington or Beijing’s rapid political decisions could create economic conditions that would launch the economic outlook in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia’s think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Foreign Minister said.
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said the conditions in the country are improving.
“Today’s situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of devastated terrorists in a normal state.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that Syria has abandoned more than 5.5 million people since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed not to accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsored by the rebels.
Europe responded strongly to the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National Square at the edge of the difficulty in France.
The U.S. has now lost sixth on European ground, so Ryder Cup has not won in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points necessary for the defeat of the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tournament, then burned the ball into water at 3 pairs of 16 jams and left Francesco Molinarimu's victory.
Italian golf player Molinari has then shine in all of his wheels and became one of four players and has achieved the best score 5-0-0 since the existing format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 European team players with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world’s most rated player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who probably completed his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points earned for his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help today.
It was a hard year ago.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He gave a cup to his countryman John Ramp, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride that I defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up on watching that guy,” 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all ages who won 14 of the biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has played the whole weekend in an attempt to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk, after the unsatisfied results of his team, said: “I’m really proud of those boys, I really fought.
This morning we really warmed Europe at the heart.
We really couldn't do it.
I'm shaking a hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will reassemble and, in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, we will move forward.
I like those 12 boys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really have to screw.
You played us."
Red flood updates: concentrations are reduced in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates a total decline in the concentrations of red flood in Tampa Bay.
According to FWC’s statement, the flourishing waters are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – that indicates a decrease in concentration.
The flowering waters of the Red Sea range about 130 miles of the coast from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The hills were observed about 10 miles from the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week it was relatively fewer places.
The red river was also observed in the district of Pasco.
Last week median concentrations were reported on the coast or offshore in the district of Pinellas. In the district of Hillsborough, low to high concentrations were observed on the offshore, low to high concentrations were observed in the district of Manatee, low to low to high concentrations in the district of Charlotte, low to low to high concentrations in the district of the coast or low to low to the sea concentrations in the district of Sarasota.
Respirational irritation continues to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
The airway irritation has not been reported in Northwest Florida last week.
