The rapidly growing complexity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is showing the same trend in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom that confirms that COVID-19 is on different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and deep care units should increase their preparations for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients that will need health care, particularly deep care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of unknown Nimonia cases was informed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China informed Novel Coronavirus, which is now referred to as severe severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronary disease (COVID-19).
To date, the evidence is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild diseases, i.e. with or without immune, respiratory pathway infections and most of them are cured.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease that requires treatment in the hospital, while in the remaining 6% of cases, Victal disease that requires serious care is considered.
The death rate of patients prescribed in the hospital is about 4% due to COVID-19.
In this study, we evaluate the trend of covid-19 complexity in each country and the United Kingdom in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and compare its Hubei province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK during January 31 - March 15, 2020 with Italy.
Covid-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
Since China, COVID-19 has expanded geographically further, and currently COVID-19 has increased activity in the rest of the world's countries from the same country.
On March 11, 2020, the Deputy Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 major.
The version of the 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al., WHO has been first informed of the European confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 24, 2020.
Until March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) found COVID-19 cases, including only 17,750 cases with Italy and 1,441 deaths between December 31, 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases with 1,727 deaths.
Covid-19 cases and achieve the complex number of cases and the complex expansion
In the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of Countries, National and Regional Health Authority and WHO reports COVID-19 cases are updated every morning at 8:00 a.m.
These figures were used to assess the tendency of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated the 14-day short comprehensiveness of COVID-19 cases, taking into account each natural process of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period of 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the complex number of cases reported in each country on January 31 - March 15, 2020 compared to Italy on March 15, 2020 until 8:00 a.m.
The tendency of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day short-term expansion of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK is usually followed by Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and throughout the UK, the overall comprehensive expansion of COVID-19 began around February 21 and increased rapidly around February 28, 2020 (Interface content).
This was mainly due to a severe increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the same trend has been seen in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK as a whole in the broader scale of COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
This particularly indicates that until 15 March at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the complexity of COVID-19 suggests that the ocean is growing with comparable speeds in all countries.
It is in different stages of countries, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions and patients to choose, regardless of the various protocols, which should be examined necessary for the confirmation of COVID-19, including the capture.
In early March 2020, in affected areas in Italy, doctors reported a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed deep care and media sources reported that hospitals and deep care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
The numbers of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or deep care units are currently only available at the EU/EEA level: 6% and 1% for cases (not shown).
However, they should be collected in a manner prepared to match current monitoring data, focusing on the number of informed cases and the number of deaths.
The study in 2010-11 showed a large difference between 29.2 and 4.2 beds in Portugal in the availability of deep care and intermediate care beds in Europe per 100,000 in Germany.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (in 2010-11, 12.5 deep care and medium-sized care beds per 100,000 people).
Deep Care Bed Capacity &gt; 90% of the spread of COVID-19 cases in hospitals related to risks with estimates for every EU/EEA country and UK Health Care Capacity Accidents involving deceases related to COVID-19. The strict risk assessment of ECDC has been updated in six
Since cases have yet to be in flags in some of the EU/EEA countries and UK regions and hospitals and deep care units generally serve the defined regional population, information about cases and deep

Experience from Italy and the current trend in other countries shows that COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and profound care facilities such as SARS-CoV-2’s continuous community broadcasting status and health care, especially in affected areas such as Italy’s profound care, should be prepared to increase the number of COVID-19 patients required.
As indicated in the strict risk assessment of the latest ECDC, by limiting the shame-changing attitudes, to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to provide a quick, responsive, resilient, resilient and comprehensive approaches in terms of the case, as if time-consuming
The severe risk assessment also lists public health measures to eliminate the impact of Maharashtra.
Countries have very little chances to increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
When it fails, it is very likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries have to beat rapidly in patients who need deep care in the coming days or weeks.
Heavily severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to the coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 3,000 people have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and have been infected by more than 80,000 people elsewhere in China and the world.
Like its decorative virus SARS-CoV, which causes thousands of SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be communicated with lights and produce similar symptoms by the goods activity.
Nevertheless, the expectation of COVID-19 SARS is the lowest and death rate, but is much more movable than the expectation of young people and more affecting older men and women than the expectation of young people.
In line with the number of rapidly growing publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a thorough and comprehensive review on the rapidly developing research topic.
We will include basic things on the disease's mathematical sciences, sciences, poisoning sciences, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and prevention.
Although there are still many answers to many questions, we hope that this review will help understand the fatal disease and help its deformation.
Due to the breakdown of Novel's viral disease, on January 25, 2020, all Chinese people who have been requested to stay at home for a whole vacation and afterwards for several weeks have become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for them.
The virus, coronavirus (CoV) is very similar to that which caused excessive severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and called the CoV Disease-19.
Maharashtra Wohan has begun from China and has rapidly spread to nearly 50 other countries across the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 40,000 patients have died from hospitals and more than 3,000 have been confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "the enemy of the people number 1" and is possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, Toxicism-Science, Made-Science, Hypo-Science, Diagnosis, and Many of the authors published by more than 200 posted on Covid-19, including
This is an attempt to present new and rapidly developed research progress in the field of research.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare other diseases caused by COVID-19 SARS and CoV to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 Prokop).
We will also discuss some other issues, along with the prevention and prediction of diseases, about what we have learned so far.
CoVs are generally considered non-attackable for humans, with approximately 15% of common winter 4 generated workplaces.
Nevertheless, in this century we have faced twice extreme sick human CoVs, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which causes the numbers were originally seen in 2003 in Saudi Arabia and in 2012 in China and with many other countries in Saudi Arabia.
Thus, the current Covid-19 is a third CoV spray in the archived history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1,1, the flag of Nemonia, whose original was unknown, was first informed by the Chinese National Health Commission on December 31, 2019 from Wohan.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
The first deadly case was reported from Wohan on January 15, 2020.
During this time, Maharashtra rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, health care providers received infections, indicating that human trafficking was possible.
On January 23, the city was locked with all its public transport shutdown.
The first clinical study on the disease reported on January 24 that only 21 of 41 confirmed patients had a direct contact from the maritime food market, which was considered the starting place of infection from an unknown source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the Prokope to be a global health disaster.
Until this report, the disease has already spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is growing rapidly, the ultimate scope and intensity of the spray remains to be determined.
A more up-to-date picture of Marriage was presented on February 11, 2020, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, including 8,866 patients in multi-centre study (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People from all ages of SARS-CoV-2 have been infected, but mainly 30-65 years old.
About half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very less than 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons were under 10 years of age.
More than men were infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spreads mainly in Hubei and around it.
Covid-19 has an average of 5 (2-9) days from the beginning to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people grew rapidly before January 23, 2020, consuming widespread transportation in China before default.
The death rate of confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted death rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors of COVID-19 were male (men), age (≥60), and severe nimonia.
CoVs, is the sub-family of large and controlled viruses with single fighters of RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., Alpha, Beta, Gama and Delta, of which they are known to infect humans with Alpha and Beta-CoVs.
Coating Noc (S) in glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV: Its co-producing enzyme enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptide 4 (DPP4) is associated with and then melted.
Viral RNA becomes degenerated in cohesive tissue; after the regeneration of viral RNA, coatings with glycoprothenes and nucleocapsid proteins create genomic RNA viral pollutants, which subsequently leads to the viral inflammation of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has found a new type of beta-CoV, which has found more than 99.98% organic similarity in 10 sequential samples collected from the sea food market from the original location of the spray.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
By transmitting electron efficiency, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in extreme areas of human air pollution.
Human ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have been detected.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein is associated with human ACE2 with more weakness than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 produces less severe infection than SARS-CoV in patients.
It can also create encoded by SARS-CoV-2, orf3b, orf8, orf8, orf8, orf8, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2, orf2 orf2 orf2 orf2 orf2 orf2 orf.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b can play a role in viral disease and can block IFNβ's expression; although orf8 does not have known functional domains or variables.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the ACE2 cryo-EM structure of human full-length ACE2 on a 2.9 Å resolution in a mixture with Amino amal carrier B0AT1.
He found that the mixture, containing free and closed compositions, was combined as a dimmer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture can add two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a medical target for medical examination.
The original and intermediate food
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were both produced from lamps and communicated in humans: Sevet Cats and Unt.
Due to the general comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the membrane was considered the primary nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is like two SARS-like CoVs that are called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, 96% of them are similar.
However, which intermediate feeder has unknown help in infecting human beings through the virus's obstacle species, and the pathways of transmission are still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed Shampoo as a conjugator of the virus in humans from the shampoo, which included similar recycling to the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that Pangolaine - Primary - is used in traditional Chinese medicine, the long-scale breastfeeding SARS-CoV-2 and CoV-proportional to SARS-2 and Pangolaine.
However, the spread of 1% in the entire genome remains a big difference; therefore, it is expected to have decisive results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet mostly known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive 48 hours in an artificial dry environment and less than 20 °C and 40%-50% at a concentration for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have the same properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, at 56 °C is sensitive to 30 minutes and is sensitive to parabagan rays; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-contained ethanol, parastic almond, chloroform and other fatty acids, but the virus is effectively discharged.
The entire human population usually has a lack of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore hypersensitive to the novel virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on anti-SAR-CoV-2 related to direct science has been informed.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Usually, after dissolving in the feed of the virus, it is the first time C-type lacticin-small receptors, total-small receptors (TLR), NOD-small receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-small receptors (RLR), including RRR-small receptors.
Through various pathways, the expression of virus providers, the maturity of dendric cells and the composition of Type I interferon (IFNs) which limits the spread of the virus and has the macrophage of the viral reactions.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help prevent the virus from protective reactions.
Soon, customized resistance response will be involved in fighting the virus.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including T cells, play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific resistance and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-suppliant cells are producing supportive cytocain to help protect cells.
However, CoV, T cells can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
It is also necessary to combat viral infections, including antidepressants and antidepressants such as C3a and C5a.
For example, safeguards removed from healthy patients have disabled MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the defense system generates a very large number of locally free cells that can cause severe damage to fever and other organs, and in the worst situations, multiple failures and deaths.
It is more likely that the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by the beginning, will affect elderly people and pregnant women.
It is common that those who come into contact with more numbers of viruses or whose resistant functions are associated with, are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wohan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, 1,099 cases study found that the intervention period was an average of 3 days and its limit was 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, on the basis of the statistics of 8,866 cases, the recent study found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantaine time based on the most accurate intervention period and thus preventing infected but symptomatic people from communicating other people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who come in contact with or have been infected with the virus usually require 14 days quarantaine.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever: The main and initial symptoms of COVID-19 may not be any symptoms or other symptoms such as drought, respiratory deficiency, muscle pain, swelling, headache, neck pain, nausea, pain in the nose, nausea, nausea, nausea, pain and stomach.
Some patients experienced breathing disruption and/or hyperacemia after the beginning of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have rapidly increased the development of severe breathing syndrome, septic shock, chemish disorder and coglopathy.
While patients with severe fever and/or respiratory symptoms and unusual photosynthesis, pre-diagnosis should be examined.
At the end of December 2019, a statistical study found that 98% percent of symptoms were for fever, 76% for drought, 55% for breathing crash, and 3% for dust; 8% patients were required to be ventilated.
The same conclusions were reported in two recent studies of the family band and the same findings were reported in two recent studies of the band generated by the transmission of a family band with a symptomatic person.
Comparatively, the 2012 public statistical study found that MERS-CoV patients were also the main symptoms of fever (98%), droughts (47%) and breathing disorders (55%).
Nevertheless, somewhere more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them had a need for ventilation, and this corresponds to more mortality than the MERS expectation of COVID-19.
The dose (26%) and throat failure (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), breathing steam (40%-42%), stomach (20-25%) and throat disorders (13-25%) were main symptoms, and nearly 14%-20% of patients had need of ventilation.
The death rate of COVID-19 was 2% by February 14, when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Compared, the rate of SARS death by November 2002 was 8,096 confirmed cases 10%.
According to MERS, on the basis of the public statistical study of June 2012, the death rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
The previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 5.71-7.23 with 95% trust interval (CI) above 6.47 while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in Table 1.1 in relation to symptoms, death rates and R0.
The above statistics indicate that the ability to spread SARS-CoV-2 is greater than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less deadly than both later.
Consequently, controlling SARS-CoV-2's scale is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Initial living in the flag is the same family or same generation or vehicle such as cruise is made of water.
Patients: The history of contact with people or infected persons or patients is either traveling or in other affected areas within the first two weeks or other affected areas.
However, it has been reported that people can transport the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and the patients who have been released from the hospital can transport the virus again, causing a warning to increase quarantene time.
In the early stages, the number of blood cells (especially glucose cells) in patients is normal or lower.
For example, lucican cell calculation &lt; 1×109/L calculation of sweat blood cells &lt; 4×109/L and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and toxicity were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
In the blood of some patients, the levels of tissue and muscle enzymes and yogoglobin increased and C-reactive proteins and aristocrat depression in the blood of most patients increased.
In severe cases, a product of fiber rupture present in the blood, the levels of D-Dimmar, increased and the calculation of the cells of the lucics continued to decline.
In most COVID-19 patients there are abnormalities in radiography of the skin, and in the fevers are shown by bilateral sharp images or bulb glass insights.
Patients: Unusual immune system, severe injury in the fever and severe respiratory crash syndrome (ARDS) develop.
When it comes to ARDS, an uncontrolled tract is seriously contracted with gas exchange due to the body composition, and progressive fibrosis.
The side effects of type I and type II neurocytes reduce the surface-creative level and increase the surface tension, thus reducing the ability to bloom the feathers and increase the risk of stopping feathers.
Therefore, the worst findings of Ken's radiography are consistent with the most serious condition of the disease.
In the first diagnosis of disease related analysis on COVID-19 on February 18, 2020, a patient who has died of disease fever, becomes a neurocyte, becomes Halin Zilli, and the devastating resorption of the lyca cells, and the RRSs and RDS of the disease and the multiple multicentric cells of the SARS and RDS of the diseases and the diseases of the multicentric cells.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcryptose polymer chain response (RT-PCR) was used as a major measure for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high misleading-negative rate, which may lead to faster in the United States, the 13th February 2020 began to be used for diagnosis of clinical expressions in China (which was no longer only dependent on RT-PCR).
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the history of the disease, clinical expressions, laboratory investigations and radiological findings are essential and necessary to effectively diagnose.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Range Group announced a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which uses displacement, without having to use any detailed equipment requirement, 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L. SARS-CoV-producer 10-producer per input
If the clinical samples are verified, it is hoped that the new technology can increase sensitivity and functionality from the playback.
Due to lack of experience with Novel CoV, medical patients can provide mainly covid-19 patients with aid care for other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases that were first used or proposed to treat or treat various treatments.
These medications include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, antiretroviral agents, steroids, cured patients with plasma, chinese medicines and psychological assistance.
Plasma has also been proposed for treatment of correct patients.
Pharmaceutical companies have been forced to develop resistance to the virus and TC.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks mostly fevers and possibly other organs that express ACE2, such as gastrointestinal system and cords.
However, respiratory heat and failure are the main threats to patients and are the main causes of death.
Therefore, breathing assistance is important to save symptoms and life, and it includes general oxygen treatment, high-stream oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation based on the severity of the disease.
Extraporyal oxygenation (ECMO) of patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted by modified heart-feeding submarine technology to be used in the treatment of mortal heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolite balance, preventing secondary infection and treating and protecting the function of septic shock, and important organs, is also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that seitocain stomach SARS and MERS patients are the result of an excessive response to the immune system.
Sytocine form TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1 is a type of systemic response that characterizes the production of sytocine chain including.
These develop protective cells that are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organic failure to reduce a large number of free cells.
Resistance is necessary in the treatment of seitocain stomach, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocylizumab, IL6-anti-monoclonal resistance, are used for the treatment of seitocain stomach.
Change in T cell resistance response directed to other resistance treatments for cytokine for; IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF necklace; JAK suspension; Blinatumomab; Cytokine signaling; and HDAC resistance.
As an anti-resistance steroid, the supplier was widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe damage to fever in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects by natically affecting the disease-diagnosis, particularly non-social abnormality.
However, it is recommended to use seriously with moderate doses of corticosteroids in diseased COVID-19 patients with caution.
Until the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
Nevertheless, a newlyotic analogue is found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral medication developed by Giliad for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses in the beginning.
Later, Ramdesivir also showed potential blockages of other endocrine RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
On their basis, the Galliad has provided China with a compound to test two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite expected.
In addition, barcitinib, interferon-a, ayopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as a potential treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
After combined treatment with ayopinavir/ritonavir, there may be symptoms, ulcers, intestinal damage and other adverse reactions.
Mutual action with other drugs used in patients of these treatments should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and Protective Production from Cured Patients
In order to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from getting infected with the same disease, there is a long history of blood integration from infectious patients who are treated with the same disease.
In fact, in the blood of healed patients there is a high level of resistance against the patient.
The immunoglobulin (Ig) antioxidants produced by B-lusic cells to fight patients and other external substances are immunoglobulin (Ig) and they identify unique cells in patients and directly deactivate them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had been healthy with COVID-19 and inhibited in 10 seriously diseased patients.
Its symptoms have improved within 24 hours with lower proliferation and viral burden and better oxygen levels in the blood.
However, unless specific medications are developed, verification and clarification is necessary for the use of the method at a high level.
In addition, despite the medical effects, prior attention should be taken into consideration on some plasma-related vulnerabilities.
For example, antibadism resistance reactions can be excessive and can cause cytocaine productivity syndrome, which possibly has life-threatening poisoning.
The concentration of resistors in the blood usually remains below, and the demand for plasma is increased to treat seriously diseased patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce so fast-paced resistances to combat the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and more practical to identify the organic code that encodes the B cells from correct patients or to check the effective resistances against the necessary proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can quickly increase the production of resistance.
TCM has been used to treat many kinds of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its impact depends mainly on the combination of different components in the formula based on a diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective components are still unknown or negligible because such components or their optimal combination is difficult to remove and verify.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for them, with moderate symptoms of lightweight TCM or those patients who have been healed from serious stages.
For example, Shu Feng G Dou capsules and Lion-have Quing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
In many provinces of China, 87% of patients using TCM (63.7%), nixie (50%), and hunna (50%), the best rates of covid-19 treatment were observed, while the Hubei province where only nearly 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the minimum rate of healing was (13%).
However, it is fairly thick as many other effects factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, spokespersons and co-workers published studies to compare only Western drug treatment (WM) and combined treatment of WM and TCM.
He found that the time of normal body temperature in the WM+TCM group, the need for symptoms and hospitalization was notably lower than the WM group.
The most influential, just WM+TCM group's symptomatic emergency rate was notably lower (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and death rate was lower than WM+TCM group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, TCM's effectiveness and safety are still waiting for more controlled tests at higher levels and more centers.
It would also be interesting to identify the system of actions and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Suspects of COVID-19 or confirmed patients experience a lot of fear of excessively contagious and deadly disease and quarantaine people also experience trembling, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, alpha oxygenity and pancreas, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as corticosteroids, can generate anesthesia, more beautiful and mental suffering.
In the early stages of SARS procop, many psychological diseases, including constant stress, bechni, tours of anxiety, mental excitement, mental symptoms, prejudice, even suicide, have been reported.
Finding and quarantaine compulsory contact as part of the public health responses of COVID-19 Procope; it can make people touching, quarantaine, and making the impacts of cholera on their families and friends more fragile and glacial.
Therefore, COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and those in contact with them, as well as the general public should be provided with mental health care.
The establishment of multi-thematic mental health parties in psychiatric meetings, SARS-CoV-2 should be constantly communicated with clear and accurate updates and to avoid close contact with each other. Professional electronics and communications to avoid close contact with each other
However, effective measures are necessary to regulate the hardening of trafficking in sensitive nutrients from insects and infected humans and there is no antiviral treatment in general control due to increasing viruses.
The SARS-CoV has been attempted to develop S-protein-based TACs to create long-term and powerful deactivating and/or defensive resistance against SARS-CoV.
The SARS has been evaluated in the bio-sensitive reserves of the live-component.
However, in the elderly people and deadly challenging figures, these expectations have to be determined before the beginning of any clinical study of their safety against the vivo effect and the genotic virus infection.
This is probably because SARS gradually ended 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the contrary, because of the presence of jenotic sources in the regions of Maharashtra, MERS's hidden cases and flags originate in the Middle East and spread into other areas.
Deactivation strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmates, viral vectors, nanocans, virus-smalls and re-order protein subunits and some have been evaluated in similarities.
The development of safe and effective TC against SARS-CoV-2 for non-resistent individuals is an extremely important and important task to control the shoreline.
However, the long-term requirement in development of TC (average 18 months) and CoVs is challenging due to the dynamic variations of difficulty.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can slowly heal without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high disease and death rate in patients with serious cases.
Therefore, it is necessary to shape disease-discrimination in order to determine the priority of their services for health-care agencies, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on still informed clinical studies, the following factors may affect or relate to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age for SARS disease-diagnosis was the most important factor, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the case study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly at the ages of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of patients were over 50 years old, as described above.
Patients with profound care were more likely to have patients involved and complications and who did not have such a need were more than they were mentioned in the above-mentioned age (51 vs. 66), which is considered as a predictive factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Men are more than women infected than SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as stated above.
Hospitals and complications: COVID-19 patients who need deep care are more likely to suffer from severe heart injury and injury.
Heart attacks were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, ACE2-positive collagenesisates can also be associated with which Covid-19 patients can cause intestinal disease.
It is worth noting that age and inherited diseases are deeply associated and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates severity or damage to tissue and is proposed as a potential predictive factor for reaction, treatment and ultimately healing.
Covid-19's severity and the severity of disease-diagnosis have also been proposed to match the CRP level.
In addition, increased lactate hydrogenes (LDH), sparate aminotransferes (AST), alenaine aminotransferes (ALT) and creatinine kineses (CK) can also help to estimate results.
These enzymes are widely manifested in many organs, especially in the heart and tissue, and are depleted during tissue damage.
Thus, they are a traditional indicator of heart or intestinal diseases.
Main clinical symptoms: for the prediction of the results and complications of Covid-19 and the results and complications of the covid progress of radiography and clinical symptoms with other problems should be considered.
The use of steroids: As stated above, steroid providers are antiretroviral agents that are generally used as co-ordinate treatment in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of damage.
As high-dose corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from uncomfortable destabilization with life-long exacerbation and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in COVID-19 patients for the following doses and overdose.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from exceptional stress during the COVID-19 probe, as they have witnessed the death of six and close family members and associates in the long term of quarantine.
It is very necessary to provide psychological advice and long-term sadness to help these people get rid of stress and come back in normal life.
According to recent public studies, different of the SARS of COVID-19 have been shown in general science-related characteristics.
As well as creating replication in the low breathing path, SARS-CoV-2 effectively can replication in the upper breathing path and does not produce any mild or symptoms in the initial stage of other infections such as CoVs that generate jugm.
Therefore, infected patients can generate a large number of viruses during daily activities during initial stages or incubation periods with a lot more difficulty in controlling the pandemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were too ill, while most of the transmission were not during the initial phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 spraying is much more serious and more difficult to control than the current spraying of SARS.
In the hope of placing regulations in the broadcasting of SARS-CoV-2, China continues very large efforts in lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantaine of almost the entire population, including the ongoing quarantaine.
Although these steps are notably destroying the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the decline of Maharashtra.
The most hopeful estimate is that the breakthrough will end by the end of March and the departure phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts aren't so hopeful.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Iran Longini, et al., has set up a correspondence to predict the outcome of Maharashtra and has indicated that two-thirds of the SARS-CoV-2 world could infect the population.
Canada's group reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been recovered and 2 weeks ago has been identified in both the mid-turbinet and throat of patients leaving the hospital, indicating that the identified new virus, flu, may occur repeatedly.
Nevertheless, there have been predictive signs from China based on the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Initially, a million cases were expected to happen with half a million deaths of Ebola.
However, by hard quarantaine and separation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 infection and end up at the end, or to become a less sick virus that co-existence with humans.
Compared to the SARS and MERS of the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also extremely transmissible from direct contact with contaminated materials and possibly from the virus.
The virus was also found in the mal, which also generates a new possibility of streaming from the mal.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 healthcare providers, were possibly due to medical infections.
Therefore, humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, co-workers and patients should also be very careful to protect people or infected persons who are in contact.
The first row of defence that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear mask; it is helpful to control the spread of the virus by using both the shelcytherapeutic mask and N95 respiratory mask (Series # 1860s).
The drops of the mask of the skin of the face prevent the air from getting into the air from a potentially infected person or sticking to the surface of things, from which they can go into others.
However, with only 5% of Varians fully crossing, only N95 (Series # 1860s) masks can prevent 10 to 80 nm as small Varians from breathing in; SARS-CoV-2 size is similar to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since cans can also cross a top five clinical masks, health care providers with direct contact with patients should necessarily wear N95 masks (Series # 1860s), except clinical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear isolation walls that fit and reduce contact with the viruses.
The virus can also infect a person with the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body from its provider's eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear a transparent face or glasses working with patients.
In affected or potentially affected areas, the general population is highly emphasizing that everyone is trying to wash his hands with more often than normal kitanunasic soap, to stay inside the house for self-quartanin and limit contact with possibly infected persons.
Three feet of distance is considered appropriate for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to prevent the spread of viruses by reducing the risk of infection.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus for the human world, as reported on January 7, 2020, due to excessive similarity by SARS-CoV, it would be highly causing China on the basis of the profound memory of SARS in 2003.
However, by January 19, 2020, the director of the Wohan’s Disease Control Center said to the citizens that the Novel Virus has a low human-to-human infection and limited fertility capacity and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message freed the public quite scary, especially when the whole country was preparing for the population and the time has passed to limit the disease to the minimum level in Wohan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn from it largely and can improve significantly in the future.
For example, these agencies should be sufficiently careful when making public announcements, since each word should be relevant to citizens and can change their views and decisions; (2) Recognize the ability to respond to competent authorities or authorities; Recognize the ability to respond to competent authorities and recognize the ability to respond to formal information (3) rather than awaiting clinicians.
Novel virus SARS-CoV-2 was launched by COVID-19 in the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread to the time of this writing throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 vaccine has repeatedly said it is SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit disease and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects more than older men and women than young people expect, and the severity and death rates in older people are also higher than young people expect.
SARS's death rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Covid-19 patients also transmit the virus when symptomatic, while SARS patients do so when they are seriously ill, which causes much more difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
It partially explains why SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV spreads with more rapid and widespread expectation.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, healthy patients can be positive again for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases remain solved, which are the following:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the SARS-CoV-2 and two lamps have been found between SARS-CoVs, we are still unable to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 has come from the lamp.
What was the average species in the transmission of the virus in humans from the original feeder, to be honest?
Without finding answers to #1 and 2, we can not effectively stop broadcasting and can ever be repeated.
Although molecular reaction and bio-chemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 connects, what type of airway enters into the cells and then changes the disease related?
Is the virus also linked to ACE2-expressed cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot receive fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the city remain?
What type of virus is developing in human trafficking?
Will it become a global pandemic, slowly ending like SARS, or will it be repeatedly like flu?
It is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
Nevertheless, whatever the price has to be low, we have no other option than to stop the fast-track and bring our lives in a normal situation.
The origin of human corona viruses
Due to change and adaptation, coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) have also developed for thousands of years.
Before 2003, Jucam knew about two human CoVs (HCoVs) that caused mild diseases.
Several severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and intermediate respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection, keeping the condition completely clear.
At the end of 2019, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in the middle of China re-enlighted CoVs, and its sister's expected more contagious capacity than SARS-CoV but decreased disease.
HCoV infection is a genetic disease and our work will come to understand the genetic origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs are derived from lights, in which they are non-rogenic.
Some of HCoVs also have information on intermediate cosh nutrients.
In the prevention of human diseases, the identification of foodstuffs is directly linked to the identification of foodstuffs.
Investigation of CoV-nutritive interactions in animals can also put an important insight into the disease of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current information on the seven HCoVs, along with the history of the search as well as focusing on the original and interactive transmission.
Importantly, we compare and view different HCoVs from the viewpoint of viral numerical development and gene recovery.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this perspective.
In addition, the need for successful nutrients to change and the severity of the disease has also been highlighted on the equipment of the numerical development of the virus.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of coronaviruses, including Invald, Positive-Sensed, Single-Stended RNA viruses.
These viruses were named "CoVs" in the RNA viruses, which gave the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms, because of the cutting-edge form-science under the electron efficiency.
Structurally, CoVs have no-sectional genes whose shapes are similar.
Almost two-thirds of the genes contain two large excessive reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyprothene.
16 non-structured proteins of polypropylene called nsp1~16 are further processed to produce.
The remainder of the genome is ORF for structural proteins, including spice (S), Invelop (E), membrane (M) and N.
Several species of proteins are also encoding by various genes of CoVs.
Depending on the variation of protein sequence, CoV is divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, Gama-CoV and Delta-CoV), most of which have beta-CoV generations of HCoVs and have four variations (A, B, and D-C).
The nationwide evidence has shown that mushrooms and mushrooms are mostly the gene sources of Alpha-CoVs and Beta-CoVs, while birds are the main coas of Gama-CoVs and Delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers and have developed some important human patients.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
These are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 Alpha-CoVs.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 typically produce mild symptoms such as coach and/or text.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2, severe respiratory infarction syndrome (ARDS) and excessive fluctuations are relatively more likely to occur in patients with severe lower respiratory disorders.
The first HCoV-229E race, B814 was separated from the nose absorption of patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, detailed studies and information on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have been collected, both of which generate symptoms that limit themselves.
In fact, before SARS's breakthrough, this concept was widely accepted that HCoVs infection is generally harmful.
With the rate of death of approximately 10% of the revised cases, the SARS propulsion in 2003 is one of the most devastating propulsions in the current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) Prokope produced a constantly living in the Arab Islands with other hidden spreads around the world.
2019 Novell HCoV (2019-nCoV), after which SARS-CoV-2 was named, is a major agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes 3,120 deaths to March 3, 2020 and more than 91,000 people have been infected.
The warning clock is on time and the world must be ready for the future of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs are originated from lightning, sugar or pets.
Several evidence supports numerical development from all HCoVs lights, in which the virus is well customized and non-orgaanic, but shows excessive organic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented very large medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
The discovery of the famous source of HCoVs provides the way to understand the natural history of the species of prolongation, inspiring power and binding factors.
This can guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 cohesion, intermediate and increaseing nutrients, with a significant effect on preventing future spread.
In this review, we present an overview of the native, intra-transmission, and diseasedness of HCoVs.
In particular, we put light on the common subject and discuss that HCoVs maternal viruses are not pathogen in their natural cosh nutrients, but become pathogen after intracellular transmission in the new nutrients.
We will also review the tendency of HCoV's recreational development with an increase in contamination: with a decrease in disease.
This perspective also discusses the results of the propulsion of SARS-CoV-2 ongoing.
The CoVs data has been in the late 1930s.
Various different CoVs were separated from the first of the HCoV-229E breeds to be deported from Nazica for the first time of infected patients, including pigs, cattle, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in recent decades.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV's search will provide and educate information (Table 1).
The first race of HCoV-229E in 1966 was separated from the respiratory pathway of patients with the upper respiratory pathway infected, which later became adapted to grow in the cognitive lines of WI-38 fever.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, 10~20% of cases were observed symptoms of coughing with fever, pancreas, abnormality and throat.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the rheumatoid pathway and organ degradation in the milk sugar brain.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection show similar appearances of HCoV-229E infections that are characteristicly invisible from infections with other respiratory pathway patients such as inflation A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread around the world and are likely to be mostly communicated during the cold autumn with Shito weather.
Usually, the period of recreational development of these two viruses is less than a week, after which there is about 2 weeks of disease.
According to a study of human volunteers, mild jugs have developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Insufficiency in prevention only causes severe low breathing pathway infections in some patients.
SARS, also known as "Apical Nemony", was the first major cause of HCoV in human history and was found the third factor of HCoV, SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be marked in the Guangzhou province of China at the end of 2002.
There were 8,096 cases of 774 deaths with spreading across several countries and continents of SARS.
In addition to the most spreading, it is estimated that almost two secondary cases can increase in each case due to the occurrence of a period of 4 to 7 days and the 10th day of the maximum viral impact of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV at the beginning, there are symptoms such as muscles, head pain, arthritis, abnormality and cold appearance, after which the breath appears as symptoms after breathing breakthroughs, constipation and breathing disorders.
There are common abnormalities related to Linfopenia, short-lived intestinal function checks and increased creatinine kinesis SARS laboratory.
Distributed aircosial damage, epithelial cell spread and increase in macrophage are also seen in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require deep care and mechanical ventilation later.
In addition to the low breathing pathway, many organs, including the intestinal pathway, intestines and cords, may also be infected in these serious cases, which can be particularly deadly for patients with impaired in resistance.
The virus was separated for the first time from the open biopsie of the fever in relation to the patient who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, many efforts have been made in the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from 7-month children at the end of 2004 in the Netherlands.
Initially, small children, elderly and respiratory diseases have spread to inaccessible patients.
HCoV-NL63 is common to see cold-juice, congenticitis, fever, and bronchiolitis in diseases generated by HCoV-NL63.
In the second independent study, it was described to separate the same virus from the sample of a 8-month-old boy who suffered from Nimonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that approximately 4.7% of HCoV-NL63 are common respiratory diseases and its warm occurrence occurs during early summer, spring and cold seasons.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the anti-shoulder, also referred to as the crop.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with Nimonia and Broccoliasis.
In addition to Nimonia and Broccolilitis from the community, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be related to serious depression.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found to produce light breathing diseases worldwide.
All these four communities encountered HCoVs have been well adapted in humans and are less likely to be caused by excessively sick diseases in general. Although the disadvantages occurred in China, although the disadvantages occurred in China63 more unknown causes-like HCoV
Usually, when these HCoVs earn the ability to communicate effectively and maintain themselves in humans, they also become less toxic or sick.
The MERS-CoV for the first time in 2012 was separated from the fever of 60-year-old patients in Saudi Arabia, with intense immune system failure and miscarriage.
Where most cases confirmed from the laboratory originate from the Middle Ages, cases imported with secondary distribution in close relationships have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second prokop took place with 186 confirmed cases in South Korea in 2015.
MERS's clinical expressions, characterized by Progressive severe Nimonia, are addressed by SARS.
Unlike SARS, in many patients with MERS, the failure of severe bones also develops, which has yet to be seen only in MERS in HCoV diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients show gestational symptoms such as depression and injury.
On February 14, 2020, with a high death rate of 34.4%, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019 until the end of 2019, the flagship of immune diseases related to SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the Hubei province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the Procope to be an internationally concerned public health emergency due to the SARS-CoV-2 low breathing pathway infection and also called the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, with the rate of 3.4% of revised deaths, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
According to Hubei, the death rate of cases in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 produces severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as bowels, cancers and breathing crashes.
In some patients, the disease is also seen.
Nimonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly increase as a severe respiratory stroke syndrome.
Although due to 82% high nucleotide equation, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, they come in various branches of the native vase.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less patient than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmitted.
Symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Other six of SARS-CoV-2: similarities and varieties have been seen very interesting to compare with HCoVs and see toxicity.
The first, HCoV disease is very similar to the period of the treatment and the period of the procedure.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to the SARS-CoV and four communities obtained from HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are usually seen during non-specific, light or no symptoms of HCoVs obtained from a community.
On the other hand, a small top of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly low.
Thirdly, both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs featured in the broadcasting of SARS-CoV-2 are also seen.
On the one hand, the contamination of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoVs obtained from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases after progressing in human cases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, Samples of SARS-CoV-2 can be detected.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in at least some situations such as SARS-CoV, it remains to be explained by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see whether the SARS-CoV-2 community can treat weather like cases of HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including infection, disease, and persistent spread, after going into humans, will be effective on the final result of the COVID-19 spread.
All the four communities that produce light symptoms have achieved HCoVs have been well adapted in humans.
From the second point of view, it can also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both ancient HCoV marines can survive.
Those who cause serious diseases in humans and those who develop serious HCoV diseases in humans have been terminated.
In order to do so, HCoVs will be reproduced in humans in a sufficient manner of customized variations that prevent nutrient-restricting factors.
In this sense, the longer SARS-CoV-2 is produced and the more people infect, the more likely it will be to be fully adapted in humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transmission in humans from quarantaine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four communities have communicated in human populations with patients who are inaccessible to the protection of CoVs.
These viruses don't need Cosh.
On the contrary, excessive-painted SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted in humans and cannot be maintained in humans.
They need to stay and spread in their native cohesion and possibly find the opportunity to be spread to human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to the SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the HCoVs achieved in four communities.
At least in the current time, it is very contagious like HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, it is more patient than HCoVs obtained from the community and less patient than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and will be communicated to humans without any cough or intermediate foodstuffs.
Before discussing the native origins of HCoVs, we will have a lot of work to discuss the definitions and characteristics of HCoVs, natural, cohesive, intermediate and increasing nutrients.
However, no HCoV is a nucleic-developing nutrient, if it provides very close ancestors with sharing high equality at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The maternal virus is usually well adapted and non-rogenic in this nutrient.
In the same way, cosh feeds HCoV constantly and for a long time.
In both situations, foods are naturally infected and are natural nutrients of HCoV or its maternal virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient right before or around humans, it is not well adapted to the new nutrient and the subject becomes sick.
This intermediate nutrient can work as a parent source of human infection and temporarily reproduce the virus and then plays the role of the nutrient that increases human infection by communicating in humans.
If no HCoV can keep your transmission within the intermediate nutrient, it can be in a final infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also be adapted to intermediate nutrients and can maintain locality for a long time.
In this period, intermediate food becomes a natural cosh food.
Statistics relating to Mahamary-Science have previously been shown that the history of contact with animals with the SARS indicator case was the history of the game.
Later serosprevelences tests indicated that SARS-CoV anti-IgG was more widespread in merchants than the general population expects.
In lively native markets, the mosquitoes (paguama larvata) and the turkey dog were identified as transporters such as SARS-CoV viruses that are quite similar to SARS-CoV.
It was directly supported by the fact that no SARS has been reported before after all the quotas of the markets were killed.
Nevertheless, it has been reported that most of the wild pammes were SARS-CoV negative in the wild animals markets that do not come in contact with, wild or farms, which suggests that the palle pammes in the form can only be severe as the nutrient that increases between SARS.
As 80% of the SARS-CoV-resistant in various breeds are in the Gwangzu markets, these possibilities may not be decomposed that many species of small breastplates may also be intermediate feeders of SARS-CoV.
All of these are the ultimate nutrients of SARS-CoV.
The results of SARS-CoV's natural but-nutrient research revealed a lot of close lightning CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) known as SARS-related rinoloph lightning CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3).
These lights are positive against SARSr-CoV anti-resistance and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These and other brilliants share the equation with 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the basis for the new concept that the flashlights are the nutrients of human patients who are faced with evolving.
Many SARS such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in flashes, but none other than WIV1 has been separated as any surviving virus.
Human enzyme converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from the samples of mushrooms was shown to be used as a customer for mushrooms, cevets and human ACE2 for cognitive entry.
Interestingly, SARS patients were able to deactivate WIV1 serum of healthy SARS patients.
Until now, WIV1 is the closest predecessor of SARS-CoV in flashlights sharing the equality of 95% of the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the more similarity in these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not the nearest maternal virus and that the lightning is not the nearest cough feeder of SARS-CoV.
Active analysis grouped MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses use the same nutrient crash, deeppeptide peptide 4 (DPP4) for entry.
The MERS-CoV RNA-based polymerized RNA sequence is close to the beta-CoV conjunctions identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV in the wild cattle has been found.
MERS-CoV and its closest brilliant CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, lightning can not even be the nearest cosh feeder of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that many African countries are seropositive against MERS-CoV-specific detection resistances, such as crushed wings of the Middle East.
Similar to the virus found in humans, MERS-CoV, was separated from the nose of the nose of coughed bones, which indicates that the unt MERS-CoV's primitive cough nutrients are.
It is also noted that the excretion of the virus has been observed in the joints that are experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, usually with mild symptoms but much more.
It is noted that the infected wheat removes viruses not only from the breathing path, but also from the male path, which is also the main pathway for the removal of the virus from the lamps.
However, the questions are still present since there is no history of contact with the units before the beginning of the symptoms of several confirmed cases of MERS, possibly because of this there are human trafficking or no unknown pathways in which the species of animals that deter MERS-CoV are rooted.
CoV RaTG13 shares SARS-CoV-2 96.2% of the equation of the nucleotide, separated from the rainonophes species.
As in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to determine the maternal relationship.
That is, lightning can't be the nearest cosh feeder of SARS-CoV-2, until nearly the same lightning CoVs are found in the future.
Probably, the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 feeder should be among the selling and dead wild species in the wholesale market of seafood foods which had been associated with several initial cases of COVID-19 with potential human trafficking species.
A number of recent studies have suggested that the group of small breastplates, called Pangolin (Manis Javanica), may also allow the SARS-CoV-2-related maternal beta-CoVs.
They share equality with the new pangolain CoV genome SARS-CoV-2 with 85-92% of the newlyotic sequence.
However, they are also closely related to RaTG13 with roughly 90% similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are among the two subdivisions of SARS-CoV-2-seal viruses, of which a 97.4% ammino oral sequence comparison shares more similar to SARS-CoV-2 binding area (RBD).
On the contrary, despite the more consecutive equation, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very diverse.
In the first study of the disease pangolaine, there was also a report that the excessive DNA group of the virus was found from samples of fever, which was similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted several different conventional methods and manual curencies to generate the partial genetic sequence with a full-length of 86.3% viral genome.
We can't deny that Pangolaine is one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 nutrients.
However, due to the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence in the direct support of SARS-CoV-2 origin.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also lower than SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The pathway of numerical development of SARS-CoV-2 is still being installed in pangolas, pangolas and other breastplates.
Where the most consequence of RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolain has been found, the most genoma-wide consequence of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 has been found.
It is very intellectual that the extreme equality between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs is selectively due to arbitrary exacerbation numerical development.
An alternative proposal is part of the recycling between the SARS-CoV-2-related BTA-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wildlife species.
As a stimulating force of recreational development, recycling is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The nearest genealogical origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to ultra-painting HCoVs, the genetic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Active evidence showed that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can be derived from CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1's mother viral mucus are found.
It has been reported that the name ARCoV.2 (Applachen Reig CoV) found in the three-color lightning of North America has been closely linked to the lightning of CoV HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically associated with another shield called CoV, which was found in the ganga, although Kemilid is also its suspicious intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, the summary of the current information on the original of known HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Active analysis has provided evidence of HCoVs' intra-transmission events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, the major measure of respiratory infection was seen.
The history of the internal transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
HCoV-229E has been found closer to alpha-CoVs.
Among them is Alpha-CoV.
Many witnesses support direct traffic in humans from the lightning of the virus.
First, humans, not Alpaca, have been contacted with shields in the shared environmental housing.
Instead, there is a close relationship with humans.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related mushrooms are diverse and non-orgonal in alpha-CoV mushrooms, while the alpha-CoV is caused by respiratory disease in infected animals due to alpha-CoV.
Finally, the alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, this possibility cannot be constrained that the Alpha receives HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV humans.
In fact, the lighthouse is a direct source of human diseased viruses with ribs viruses, ibola viruses, nipal viruses and hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not surprising that lightning can communicate directly to humans HCoV-229E.
Alternatively, where flashlights are alpha-CoVs HCoV-229E's gene poultry, alpaca and cowboys may be intermediate nutrients that communicate viruses in humans, just like MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of intra-transmission in humans from bulbs and bulbs with bulbs.
The numerical development of MERS-CoV is known for its primary identification and has been further strengthened by subsequent conclusions.
It is clear that bulbs provide a wealth of virus species for interactive exchange and interactive transmission of organic parts.
Long age, dense caves, close social interactions and excessive capacity to fly are suitable conditions for being the ideal "virus spreader" of all gloves.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering cube entries for decades.
It has been well adapted in these ents that have turned from intermediate nutrients into stable and natural cosh nutrients.
MERS-CoV produces very mild diseases and maintains relatively low rates of growth in these animals.
Its hidden communication in humans is an accident and humans have become the ultimate nutrient of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of the ants in MERS-CoV broadcasting, the role of pangolain in SARS-CoV-2 broadcasting, if there is one, it is different.
With special rubbers, pangolaine beta-CoVs is much more patient in pangolaine.
They can be the final nutrient of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs such as Sevet in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans must be accepted or convicted in future studies.
First of all, bulbs can be nearly similar to SARS-CoV-2-related cohesion feeder of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans can share ecological housing with shields by killing, killing or coal mining.
Secondly, Pangolain can be one of the nutrients that increase the intermediate, with SARS-CoV-2-related viruses newly entered.
Man is infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that pets may be recoverable against several breastfeeding SARS-CoV-2, including pets.
In domestic and wild animals, there is a need for a survey of protections.
Third, as mentioned above, the recycling and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species whose contact is both lightning and pangolaine.
The SARS-CoV-2's origins are still being found.
In addition to the various kinds of birth feed, three major factors in relation to viruses are also important to smoothly cross the barriers of the species of CoV.
First of all, their relatively higher rate of growth in RNA reproduction.
Compared to other single-touch RNA viruses, the estimated CoV rate can be "high" to "high" by depending on the stage of CoV adjustment in the new foods ~10-4 replacement per year with the average replacement rate of the site 2 per year.
CoVs is a high-read exorbioneucliasis, which can also reduce excessive volatility and vulnerability or life capacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogues are considered to dimine CoV reproduction by this exo-ionuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerization.
Remdeciver is one of the most anticipated anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the growth rate of CoVs is more than ten million times than their nutrients.
In addition, the rate of change is higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high conversion rate, the SARS-CoV-2 output rate is clearly lower, indicating the high level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps it has already been adapted to the other nutrients of human beings.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to the bulbs.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the organic flow will quickly disable the antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, CoV puts additional plasticity on the genome change for large RNA generation and recycling, which increases the likelihood of interactive co-crymic development, which has the benefit of the development of Novel CoVs when the circumstances are reasonable.
It is supported by encoded protein functions on the 3rd floor of the open reading frame and the 3rd floor of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs are randomly changing reflections during RNA reproduction by a unique "Copy-Hose" function.
In the nutrients that work as a mixture, however, the changes occur during the CoV RNA transcription.
They can produce new CoVs with very similar full-length and sub-genemic RNAs, re-ajustered.
The genetic proof of natural recycling, both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoVs such as SL-CoV and SL-CoV-HKU9 have been found.
Virus-Freeder's Interaction in the Transmission
In addition to the three above mentioned viral factors, it is another important factor that affects the viral mutual-action intra-transmission with nutrients.
Here, the recycling of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed positive elections during interactive transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis of deviators between humans and Sevet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is considered to be faster adapted to various nutrients with variations of S protein RBD.
Usually, a CoV’s S protein acts mutually with RBD cognitive clay and is chosen by nutritional resistance reaction with density.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD S1 is from 318th to 510th in amino acid that connects with human ACE2 for viral entry as well as its co-grains.
RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE2 customers of various animals, including lightning, sweat, and rat dogs, which enables the interactive transmission of the viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acids have been seen different from human and sweat-viral pathways in RBD and are located in the aggregate-related origins with 4 ACE2 pathways.
The RBD of Cvet SARS-CoV have K479N and S487T variations that can increase the mutual-action of spice protein with human ACE2 grid.
In other words, these two amino-almond replacements can be important in the adaptation of the virus in humans.
It is noted that SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV shares the same cognitive bulk.
30% of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S protein unit indicates that the binding equality of its S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, the Crayo-EM study indicates more than 10 to 20 times more attraction than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other co-class would be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also connects to ACE2, but from different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV crashes, such as aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic mel for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after their native substances.
The result of HCoVs' intra-transmission is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and prohibition factors.
The difference in these nutrient proteins between humans and HCoVs can be an obstacle to the intra-transmission of natural cosh nutrients, such as mushrooms, bulbs and males.
HCoVs has to eliminate nutrient dependence factors for successful intra-transmission and to counteract nutrient prohibition factors.
In this regard, there is still to identify and describe molecular determinants in this important area of mutual-food action.
Using CRISPR's latest technology, the non-protective geno-wide testing of SARS-CoV-2 nutritional dependence and prohibition factors can be fertile.
Novel HCoVs: Return on the original basis
The variety of CoVs provides sufficient opportunities for the formation of the Novel HCoVs.
In this sense, lightning works as the gene of CoVs, HCoVs.
In addition, due to rapid development and organic recycling, HCoV also develops and works two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the ability to change much more viral compounds.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related flashy viruses have been separated, but various ORF8 proteins have been encoded.
The characteristics of SARS-CoVs’ 29-nucleotide violation have been found in different races at the beginning of human majority.
It breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and it is considered an adjustment change that promotes cell change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a potential history of recycling with alpha- and Gama-CoVs branches, which identifies a very large number of small recycling areas in RNA-based polymeres.
In most parts of nsp9, nsp10, and nsp14 are also identified reassembly locations.
Similarly, it has been seen that Mayor MERS-CoV has experienced recycling events among the various revolutions, which occurred in Cuban entities in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recycling events have also been seen in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recycling with other non-structured CoVs in their non-structured genes.
It should also continue that artificial elections can change the non-governmental in the viral genome, possibly due to election-free viruses, such as the nutritional resistance system.
An example of these effects is the whole length ORF4 loss in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to du-nucleotide monitoring.
While the ORF4 can be seen in membranes related to HCoV-229E and outlet viruses, the Alpha Alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide input, making it frame-shaped.
In the end, but not less important, the novel HCoVs’ nominal development is also due to the pressure of the election in their cosh feeders.
Symptomatic or only mild symptoms were only identified when lamps were infected with CoVs that indicate mutual adjustment between CoVs and lamps.
It seemed that the lights were structured and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, fault in the activation of pro-inflammatory reactions in membranes effectively reduces the disease caused by CoVs.
In addition, the production of natural mortal cell activity in lumbars is due to the low levels of expression of NKG2/CD94's regulatory and major tissue conformity complex category I cells.
In addition, the replication of CoV from the high level of the responsive oxygen species (ROS) generated by more chemical activity can lead to and affect the successful reading of exo-ionuclease for the supply of the vacuum, which thus affects the entry into the new nutrients.
More patient CoV breeds can also be developed by recycling, which can cause new protein or protein properties for nutritional adjustment.
Therefore, it’s not the compilation that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-medical or produce mild symptoms in cohesive nutrients such as bulbs and ointments.
Without showing strong nutritional resistant reactions, they make a strong replication.
This is the reason why symptomatic passengers are seen and why serious cases of human infection are causing.
Serious symptoms, mainly due to resistance reactions and hyperactivity of the cytocaine stomach, with the more resistance reactions, are harmful to severe fevers.
On the contrary, in non-symptomatic musicians, the resistance response has differed from the CoV reproduction.
The same anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategy to distinguish the resistance response can have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interferon response is faster especially in the lights.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in flashes is guilty.
With MCC950, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common topic as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where 95% of the equation with SARS-CoV of Bita-CoV has been observed, 96% of the equation with SARS-CoV of Bita-CoV has been observed.
While Cvet and other animals in markets have been seen giving aside the same viruses of SARS-CoV, the nearest intermediate feeders of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly the same Pangolaine beta-CoVs with SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that Pangolaine may be one of the intermediate nutrients or can contribute to the gene particles in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions were raised, there was no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was cognitively created or accidentally human-made.
CoVs, SARS-CoV-2, have been discussed due to the latest profoundness of the SARS-CoV-2.
We have greatly changed our understanding of HCoVs in the study of CoVs in chickens and other animals in the original and standard transmission.
A wide range of evidence has been shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the primary brilliance and is transmitted in humans by intermediate nutrients.
Since SARS-CoV infection occurs due to contact between humans and centuries in the markets, it should have been effectively ending the general measure of SARS by closing the wet markets and killing the centuries there.
The same reason, because of the finding of a large number of proximity of SARS-CoV-2, the pangola should be removed from the weld market to prevent genealogical transmission.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is communicated in humans by Pangolalin and other breasts and how it remains to be explained in future examinations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering cube entries for decades.
These units are the main sources of products of meat, milk, milk and wool, as well as an important means of transport for locals.
They have been widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to deflect all vessels to control MERS such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were made in the Chinese wild animals markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop MERS-CoV's effective counterparts for units in the combination of other infection control measures to prevent repeated cracking.
Since we are unable to terminate these viruses, we can come in front of new gene forms to create a spray.
Various genus CoVs are circulating in wildlife.
With special ruptures, the brightness of the coVs with well-known capacity are very diverse.
It is highly likely that these genetically recognized CoVs will be employees' development and recycling, making new CoVs come in front of which will be more contagious and/or mortal in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals in some areas of China should be eating the culture of eating.
With the tough examination of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response plans should be developed.
In fact, many viruses have been updated on the planet for a long time.
They live in their natural chorus until there is no chance of spreading.
Although there are many features that help the spread of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with them and other wild species can be minimised if people are taught to stay away from the viruses.
Continuous monitoring of breast cancers is necessary for a better understanding of the environment of their natural nutrients, which will prove useful in preventing human trafficking and future swallows.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral gestational disease is to stay away from the natural habitats of gestational viruses.
Several elements of the genocide of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First of all, if the bulbs communicate with the maternal virus of SARS-CoV-2 in Pangola, it would be interesting to see what the bulbs and bulbs within the circumstances can share the same ecological housing.
Secondly, if lightning plays a direct role in human communication, it should be determined what kind of lightning man comes in contact.
Thirdly, if a third breast is acting as a real intermediate nutrient, it should be clear that this type of mutual effect has on different species, including humans, gloves and pangolains.
Finally, since many breastfeeders, including domestic animals, can be absorbed by SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infections should be made.
Whether it's lightning, pangolain or any other breastplate, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its maternal viruses that are almost the same will be identified in their natural nutrients in the future.
Continuous examination in this area will clarify the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in births with significant effects on prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the clinical criteria of COVID-19 "suspect cases" and "certified cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team published Quick Consulting Guidelines for Diagnostic and Treatment of the 2019 Novell Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guidelines provides a reasonable reference to our experience and this major pathway worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, based on the findings of research and experience of clinical practice, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 issued by the National Public Health Committee of the Chinese People's Republic in accordance with the "Doubt Cases" and "Verified Cases".
In December 2019, 2019 has been decomposed by the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO marked COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed quick consultation guidelines and was published online in military medical research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on the findings of current research and the experience of clinical practice, our awareness and information is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
For example, further guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 by the National Public Health Committee of China from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) are available in some references. Overview with basic changes
Now a comment has been made on our guidelines by Zhou et al., he has presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
Their work has also added new certificates in our guidelines, and has also given valuable references to this merchandise around the world.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines (second test version) and recent studies for COVID-19.
According to the Seventh Version (3 March 2020), to confirm a comprehensive analysis of the suspicious case, any member of general history must be coordinated with two members of clinical expressions, or if the requirement is to satisfy the need for those who do not have clear general history.
History of the United States of America: (1) Involving the city and surrounding regions of the United States of America, or involving other communities, travel or residential history of the United States of America, where symptoms have been reported 2 in the past 14 days; (2) Involving the United States of America or involving regions such as SARS-CoV-2 Involving regions; History of the United States of America and involving regions (Involving the United States of America)
Clinical manifestations: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflected features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of blood cells of breathing indicates normal, low or lower lymphocyte in the initial condition.
Diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on any member of the patient or serum certificate SAG-confirmed case which are as follows: (1) Responsibility to SARS-CoV-2 or Responsibility to real-time PCR test is responsibility to SAG or Responsibility to PCR Positive to SAG. Responsibility to testing is indicated to testing; (2) Wireal complete genomic sequencing is known to IG.
We can see that the real-time PCR test was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020) versions in the respiratory system or blood samples.
The patient identification of the blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and to the fifth (February 8, 2020) versions, and then to the seventh version the serial certificate was added.
These researchers were based on the continued work of researchers, which searched for the samples of blood, including the respiratory system, including an optimal nucleic identification kit for rapid diagnosis. The samples increased in the availability of various samples, and the specific samples.
In addition, there are many evidences that remind us of caution with symptomatic and symptomatic patients in Approach.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it has classified the person with no clinical symptoms as "low risks".
The point system needs to be verified in further clinical practices and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct certificates will come in front and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "verified cases", we suggest to explore the latest guidelines of their home countries and follow them.
Our team will also update your guidelines from time to time to provide help.
Five new deaths from COVID-19 in Bangladesh, most of the one-day figures have been reported to date
Bangladesh confirmed five and five deaths from COVID-19 on a day.
This is the largest figure of deaths ever occurring in one day from this virus.
Until yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disz Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded infected cases, including 114 active cases and 33 people who had been healed from the disease living at home.
17 deaths have been recorded so far.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjadi Subrina Flora said four men and one woman have died.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, the age of two patients over 60, between two and 51 and 60, and between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the dead were killed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 on March 11.
A hospital official told a local news center, Anadolu Agency, that the name of the deceased was Jalal Safhur Rahman, who was director of the Bengali Anti-Infrastructure Commission and was taking care of him at the Kuweit Friendship Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi road transport and bridge minister Ubayul Qadar said road transport will be suspended even longer than planned before on Saturday.
This public transportation arrest began on March 26 and was completed on Saturday, April 4.
Medical items, fuel and food were not stopped transporting essential items.
Initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh, two people returned from Italy on March 8, and one of them was recorded in the wife of one of them.
On March 19, they were all right.
Over a million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
According to data from the University of Jones Hopkins, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections across the globe exceeded a million on Thursday.
Covid-19 is reported to be associated with at least 52,000 deaths.
On the day that the figure passed, the first coronavirus infection in Malawi was reported on the same day and the first death of coronavirus in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that it was included in some countries that are still free of coronavirus infections until Thursday.
The World Health Organization has reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in front of the mid-Europeans in the morning at 10:00 p.m. (800 UTC) to 4 April.
More than 2 lakh 44 thousand cases of the coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, with less than 5,900 deaths.
The CBS news reported that more than 1,000 deaths in the United States were killed on Wednesday, according to data from the University of Jones Hopkins.
Countries around the world have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's Major Sergei Sobyinine extended lockdown in the city until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin on the national level announced that Russia will remain unpaid until April 30.
The parliament of Portugal voted on the side of the increase of the national emergency for 15 days; the proposal passed by 215 votes, ten members were absent and one voted against it.
Saudi Arabia has placed 40 hours of curfew in Saint Macca and Medina cities; the time of the first curfew was only at 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand has planned to set a curve in the morning from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio's governor Mike Davin announced that the order of staying at home in the state has been extended until May 1.
Stores in Australia decreased the number of toilet papers that could be purchased at once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store series Volwarts and Colles reduced the number of toilet papers that could be purchased once in all their stores at national level by ordering two and one packages.
ALDI also applied the one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on checkout sites and on Facebook pages of series.
It is reported that buyers were purchasing units to keep themselves separate because of the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Volwarts also restricted the limits of purchase of toilet paper per order for home delivery on a package.
Before these changes, Volwarts and Kols had banned the purchase of a maximum of four packages once on March 4 and 5.
Cols said in its March 8 press release that despite the ban on the four-packs, "the stock is ending within an hour of delivery in many stores," and told this request in an unprecedented manner.
According to a prophecy of Wolverine, "smart-smart" came on sale last week.
The Costco store in Kenbra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
In order to reduce the deficiency and decrease, Cols gave the software orders and large packages and also increased the frequency of delivery. Volwarts ordered additional stocks, where ALDI joined stocks to quickly make available the projected Wednesday special.
The executive director of the Australian retail union, Russell Zimmerman, said attempting to increase retail stocks, but it is difficult to do so due to the restrictions imposed by the local council during the delivery of the truck.
When the software is trying to meet the demand and the number of specials has already decreased, so it is hoped to increase the production costs of rasel.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after releasing the stock in advance, some stores may not operate the special on Wednesday.
In a report from News.com.au, a retail expert at the University of Queensland of Technology Dr. Gary Mortier said stores fill stock every night.
He said that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it can't have stocks in more numbers, and then, Sarah's big shelf is cut behind when going back to stock, which makes a lack of understanding and tough.
According to the ABC news, Russell Zimmerman said, "Coles and Volwarts are the idea that if there was enough goods on the shelf, and toilet paper and sandwiches could have been available and in large quantities, it could have been reduced."
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Hugh Gibs A Crap, told last Wednesday that his stock was over.
According to a report from News.com.au, the company Kmberly Clarke, which created a toilet tissue, and the company that created a sorbent, Solaris Paper, said they're working 24/7 to maintain a sleep.
A total property site Domain.com said that in Melbourne, where holidays are celebrated on a long labour day by buyers, some property sellers are already giving free toilet paper to the first speakers in the labour market.
A day-to-day, NT news version on Thursday was an eight-letter initiation that was given to be used as a cutter toilet paper.
According to an Australian report on March 3, ABC was not willing to ban stores at the beginning; in the report he said there was no plan for them to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said that other products are also in heavy demand, including masks, sanatizers, dry things, handwashing and atha.
In the same way, out of Australia, two packs of 12-roll limits were applied on the purchase of Android toilet papers in the UK supermarket Ocado online on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 globally
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a global global pandemic in this time of coronavirus SARS CoV-2.
Although the term "vashivki mamary" means only that no disease spreads to the extent, not that its specific cases are dangerous, but the WHO discussed the need to inspire governments to act.
"Every country can now change the way to this global continent.
If the country detects the disease in its response, treats patients, keep them separated, put them in their mouths, and unite them," WHO's CEO Tedros Adonoms Gabraisis said.
"We are extremely concerned about the alarming levels of spread and seriousness and the alarming levels of inactivity, both."
According to Dr. Thomas Friedin, former director of U.S. disease control and prevention centers, it is the global ocean "afterward".
In the comments published by CNN in February, he said, "Other information about any respiratory virus has not gone from a permanent global broadcast except Influenza."
Gabrielis also made such a statement when he said, "We haven't seen the global ocean of any coronavirus until today."
"And so far we haven't seen any global manner that can be controlled at the same time," he said.
The new post of Global Maharashtra, which was mentioned in January, was issued after the WHO's trial to declare an emergency concern for public health at international level.
Dr. Anthony Fochi, director of the U.S. National Allergies and Infectious Diseases Institute, said about Procop, "It's going to be a sixth thing, it's going to get worse."
Associated press said at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases were reported on Thursday worldwide and more than 4,600 have died.
2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a ongoing coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe severe severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
It was identified in China's Wohan in December 2019, which was declared emergency at the international level on January 30, 2020 and was declared a major march on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Almost 364,000 people are fine.
The death rate in China has been estimated to be 4%, while it is at a global level from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, pancreas and breathing flowers.
Complications can include nimonia and severe respiratory infarction syndrome.
The time from the arrival of the virus to the beginning of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can even be between two and fourteen days.
It does not have a specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and auxiliary treatment. Recommended follow-up measures include: hand wash, shake your mouths on washing, keeping away from other people and monitoring and self-proliferation for those who are infected.
Worldwide authorities have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace threat controls and facilities.
This marijuana has created a serious global social-economic arrangement, inspired to stop or revoke sport, religious, political and cultural events, and has declined extensively in supplies by people with surprise purchasing.
In 193 countries, schools and universities are closed on a national or local basis, causing about 99.4% of the world's students to be affected.
Misinformation on the virus has spread online, and other Chinese people, East and South Asian indigenous and colorful people, and more virus cases, have occurred events against Zenophobia and fraud from other people.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased due to low travel and heavy industry closing.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (Hubei Province capital) reported on December 31, 2019 of common cases in Nimunia for unknown reasons, and a investigation began in early January 2020.
Most cases of Hunan were associated with the wholesale market of sea-food, and therefore the virus is considered a genocide of origin.
The spreading virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, which is a new founded virus that is closely related to coronaviruses, Pangoline coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The person who was associated with the virus was not known after the death of the person who was after the death of 1 December 2019 and the first known person with the symptoms of the disease.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases informed in December 2019 were linked to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unchecked report by South China Morning Post reported that a case was a 55-year-old in the Hubei province on November 17, 2019, which could be the first case. Also on February 26, 2020, the number of the case was reported from the number of the cases of the NOK, NOK was reported that the case was in China with the decline in new cases.
Especially in people with mild symptoms, very little information may have been reported.
Until February 26, relatively few cases were reported in young people, of which 19 years of age and less were 2.4% of cases around the world. The UK's main scientific adviser, Patrick Valens, estimated that the need for effective group protection was required. 60% of the UK's population was expected before receiving effective group protection.
The case refers to the number of people in which COVID-19 has been tested, and according to the official protocol for which the test has been positively confirmed.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies to not test people with light symptoms.
A study published on March 16, found that 86% of COVID-19 infections in China had not been estimated until January 23, and that these unreported infections were a source of infection for 79% of cases reported.
In a statistical analysis published on March 30, it was estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was much higher than the cases reported in Italy.
The initial estimate of the initial reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 are getting better.
Those who are not correct are between 6 and 41 days from the development of symptoms to death, with the most common 14 days.
Until April 10, 2020, COVID-19 was the cause of about 97,000 deaths.
In China, up to 5 February, almost 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of cases, including heart disease and diarrhea, had already existing health conditions. The official calculation of the deaths caused by COVID-19 is based on the deaths caused by the pandemic.
The number of real deaths of COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who die without testing may not include such as home, nursing home, etc.
Partial estimates in Italy found that the additional number of deaths occurring during the pandemic is 4-5 times more than the official COVID deaths.
A prophecy of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) accepted "we know that [the deadly number] is newly established", a claim that was supported by the lowest estimate described in the U.S. according to the initial reports of May May 2020. May May1 died in May 2009, May N. May H.
The first death outside of China was in Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
Until February 28, more than a dozen deaths were reported out of China, Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Until March 13, more than forty countries and regions have been reported deaths on each continent except Antarctica. Several measures are generally used to determine the rate of death.
These numbers vary according to the area and time, and the quantity of testing, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time and population characteristics after preliminary propulsion are affected by the number of cases such as age, ling and overall health. Death-generation ratio is determined within a certain interval of time
Based on the estimates of the University of Jones Hopkins, the global mortality ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) until April 10, 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In China, the mortality rate is estimated at 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting 1 February 2020). The mortality rate of cases in other measures includes a mortality rate of mortality and mortality rate (CFR), which includes mortality rates of people who have died (CFR) and mortality rates with one disease.
These loans are not timely and follow a specific population until the case is corrected by infection.
Many teachers have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Center for Aviations-Besed Medicine is estimated to have an infection rate of 0.1% to 0.39% for a totally mixed pandemic.
The upper estimate of this limit corresponds to the results of a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the first random testing of COVID-19 and CFR estimates in Germany.
The WHO claims that the ocean can be controlled.
The heat and final period of the spray is uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
Pan State University's Maquiz Boni said, "After leaving uncontrolled, infectious sprays generally become stable and when foods available for the disease don't remain, they begin to decline.
But when it will be, there is almost impossible to predict any understanding of it yet."
China's senior medical advisor, Zhang Nanashan, argued that "it can end until June" if all countries follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17th, the London School of Heavyness and Tropical Medicine, Adam Kuchsky, said that SARS-CoV-2 "is likely to be in circulation for one or two years."
According to the study of the Imperial College in the leadership of Neal Ferguson, physical distances and other measures will be required "until a tick is available (probably: 18 months or more).
William Shefner of the University of WinderBillt said, "I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus will end completely, because it's very easily spread" and it can turn into "a seasonal disease, which returns every year."
The increase in return will depend on the limits of resilience and development.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be distinctive.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and drought (68%).
Less common symptoms include: tiredness, breathing related boldness production (cause), decreased sensation of smell, breathing flowers, pain in pancreas and joints. It has an arthritis in the throat, in the shape of the neck it becomes an arthritis, in the heart, in the heart, in the cold.
U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is difficult to breathe emergency symptoms, constant pain or pressure in the chest, sudden irritation, difficulty in awakening, difficulty in developing, and preventing it from developing, and preventing the blue of the face or the ears, as listed;
Some of the infected people may be distinctive, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have advised that the confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked.
The Chinese estimate of the distinctive proportion is from some to 44%.
The usual period of infection (the time between infection and the beginning of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimated part of people with COVID-19, which had lost their sense of smell, was 30% at the beginning and was less than 15% later.
There are still some details about how the disease spreads.
It is believed that this disease spreads mainly by small drops generated during close contact and during shaking, shaking or talking; when close contact is from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) within.
Studies have found that drops can reach 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small drops generated during speaking, which last longer in the air. The drops can also be caused by breathing, including when breathing out, although the virus is not usually caused.
Drunks can go into the mouth or nose of people nearby or possibly through breathing in the fever.
Some medical procedures, such as inputs and heart Phyphosphatic Medicine (CPR), can be a vaginal respiratory disorder and thus can be caused by airborne transmission.
It can also spread when a person touches a infected surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
Although these concerns are also that it can spread by the mall, its risk is considered less.
The Chinese government has rejected the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 multi-mechanical transmission. The virus is the most contagious during the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, although communication can be possible in the stages of the disease before and after the symptoms are revealed.
There have been testing positives for the disease of people three days before the beginning of symptoms, indicating that communication is possible before developing important symptoms.
There are only a few reports of detective cases confirmed in the laboratory, but some countries have identified detective communications during contact investigations.
According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals. It survives from hours to days on the virus surfaces.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for up to one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on the canvas.
However, it vary depending on humidity and temperature. Testing positives have come for pets and other pets for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted to humans from animals, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with other surfaces affected by the infected person.
The severe severe respiratory syndrome is a new virus (SARS-CoV-2), which is first removed from three people associated with the group of cases of severe respiratory diseases in the vagina.
All features of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature. The human body dies from domestic soap, which breaks its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be the virus of the genealogical origin.
Anthropological analysis has shown that the coronavirus is the group of coronavirus beta-coronavirus, which is a group of two species of coronavirus, with two species of coronavirus.
This is 96% similar to other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genomic sequences between gangolins and humans.
Compared to the entire genome, the maximum 92% of the normal organic content between the pangolal coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which is insufficient to treat pangolals with intermediate nutrients.
Temporarily, the infection by the virus may be based on the symptoms, although confirmation ultimately occurs from reverse transmission of the infected scrave polymers chain reactions (rRT-PCR) or CT images.
A study compared to CT of PCR in Wohan suggested that CT, PCR is much more sensitive than it is, although its many picture characteristics are less specific than other immune and disease processes.
By March 2020, U.S. College of Radioology recommended that "CT should not be used as a primary test to investigate or diagnose COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, whose first version was released on January 17.
This test uses the real-time reverse transcryption polymerez series action (rRT-PCR).
This can be tested on blood or breathing samples.
The result is usually available within a few hours.
Usually, this test is carried out on a nascent fae, but the fae of a neck can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect resistance.
Until April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven not sufficiently accurate to be widely used and approved.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Inadmissible in the imaging features of the characteristics of the radiography and computed tomograph (CT) of people include unacceptable temporary gland glass clarity and absent Fufus Srav.
The Italian radiological society is collecting an international online database of imagery findings for cases confirmed.
Due to similarity with other infections such as the adenovirus, PCR has limited image specification in identifying COVID-19 without confirmation.
A large study in China compared the CT results of breasts with PCR and it was shown that although the imagery is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in larger areas.
Artificial-based curve-based neural networks have been developed to detect the imagery features of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, in strategies, maintain a complete good personal hygiene, washing hands, washing eyes, nose or lips without touching the nose, and shaking or shaking in a tour, and putting that tour directly in the box of cheese.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
It is also recommended that measures to prevent physical distances are made. Many governments have prohibited or recommended that all non-necessary consciousness in countries and regions affected by the prokop.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the status of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they were infected. Care providers who are taking care of an infected person are standard contact precautions, contact precautions and sources.
For this purpose, governments have increased concerns about the use of mobile phone location data, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for such surveillance limits.
Different mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and up to April 7, 2020, a dozen of more than a group of experts were working on privacy-compatible solutions, such as using one user to close to other cell phones.
Users receive a message then if they are in close contact with a person who has come to test COVID-19 positive. Misconceptions are spreading about ways of preventing infection; for example, nose shaving and mushrooming is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 TC available, although many organizations are working to develop a TC.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the transmission of the disease.
CDC recommends that people washing their hands with soap and water repeatedly for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are smelled; before eating; and after dipping the nose, shaking or shaking.
This is because out of the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which blows its protective bubbles.
Additionally, CDC recommended the use of at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers, when soap and water are not easily available.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth without smoking hands.
Surfaces 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropenol, 0.1% sodium hyperchlorite, 0.5% hydrogen oxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidon-iodine can be diluted from multiple bulbs including.
Other rabbits, such as benzalconium chloride and chroheoxydine gluconet, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a COVID case suspicion or confirmation on an office or a day-cair feature such as all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls.
Health organizations recommend that people swallow their mouths or nose by mowing their mouths or with a thigh and then immediately eliminate any thigh.
Surgical mask is recommended for people who can be infected, as the amount and distance of drops that come out of the breath can be limited by wearing the mask, shaking and shaking.
When and how to use masks, the WHO has issued instructions on this.
According to a physicist of the University of Leids, Stephen Griffin, "The tendency to touch people's face by wearing a mask may be reduced, which is a major source of infection without proper cleaning of hands." Masks are also thought to be used by those who are being used.
The WHO recommends wearing a mask by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are taking care of the COVID-19 person, although they also admit that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started to encourage the use of face masks by ordinary individuals.
In the United States, CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric. China has recommended the use of treatment-friendly medical masks by particularly common healthy people, especially when they come closely with other people. (1 meters (3 feet) or those)
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or staying in crowd-weighted places.
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make a mask on their faces at home and to wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited to leave public places without wearing mask or nose and nose.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested all people to wear a face mask when they go to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has obliged all persons entering the rental store to wear a face mask.
Israel has called for all citizens to wear a face mask when they go to the public area.
Since mid-March, Taiwan, producing ten million masks per day, has been required to wear face masks by passengers on rail and space buses on April 1st.
Panama made it necessary to wear a face mask while leaving, while it was also recommended for those who could not buy a face mask.
The mask of the face has also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
In social distancing (which is also called physical distancing) infectious control functions, which aims to slow the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and to close schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Staying at home, limiting the journey, avoiding the crowd, using non-contact speech, and applying ways to make social distances physically away from others.
Many governments are now recommending to create social distances in areas affected by the Prococcus.
The U.S. government agencies and health organizations have rapidly reduced the maximum population of 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 traffic in any region) to up to 50 people, and up to 10 people later.
In March 22, 2020, Germany has banned the public group of people who have been treated with the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, or the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, or the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, or the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, or the disease of the disease.
The use of the term "Social Remote Creating" is derived from that, instead of encouraging people to stay in contact with others through alternative means, it should adopt full social distribution. Some authorities have the power to use sexual health during the measure.
These include recommendations for sexual relationships with only the person who lives with you, who do not have symptoms of the virus or the virus.
People who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected of being infected have been recommended for self-approaching at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for adequate self-distribution. Many governments have recommended or compulsory for the entire population living in affected areas.
High-risk groups have issued the hardest self-quartan guidelines.

The methods for detecting the presence of the virus in the laboratory test for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods for detecting the presence of the virus in the laboratory and detecting resistance produced as a response to infection.
The confirmation of the presence of viruses in samples is by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
The use of detection of defenders (refugee-science) can be done for both diagnosis and people's monitoring.
Surveys of defenders show how many people have been ill, for those who were very mild to inform the symptoms or who were without symptoms.
The results of this investigation can determine the exact rate of death of the disease and the levels of collective resistance in people.
Due to limited checks, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in people by March 2020.
By March 23, no country has checked more than 3% of its population and how many countries have been checked, there are plenty of inequalities on this.
It is also likely that the mortality rate of this informed inequality is notably affected, which is likely to be notably more estimated in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymers can-reaction (rRT-PCR) can be checked on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasgresini fahe or bulgm samples.
The results are usually available within 2 days after a few hours.
RT-PCR testing with throat throat is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the gall, while it continues to grow in the fever.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively sample material can be taken from the inner air condition by the suction cateter or nitric material (blog) can be used to wash.
One of the initial PCR surveys was developed in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymers Chan Reaction (rRT-PCR), and the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed check kit by January 23, 2020. South Korea's company Kogenbayotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 check kit (Powerchec Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It is searching for RdRp genes found in SARS-CoV-2 from the "E" genes shared by all the beta coronaviruses. In China, BGI Group was a member of the United States of America and the United States of China, a member of the United States of America and the United States of China, a member of the United States of America and the United States of China, a member of the United States of America and the United States of America.
In the old versions of the check kit, one of three inorganic examinations resulted in the result of inconclusive outcomes of the faulty workers, and a problem in the CDC examination in Atlanta; due to this, the total number was reduced from 100 successfully processed samples in February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020 and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
Emergency use was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Authority. The U.S. professional laboratories began checking in early March 2020.
By March 5, 2020, Laboratory announced availability across the country of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 checks.
Kwest Diagnostics has launched COVID-19 tests across the country by 9 March 2020.
No quantity of premises have been declared; samples should be made in accordance with the requirements of CDC's integration and processing.
In Russia, COVID-19's state-of-the-art research center was developed and produced by VECTOR.
This check was registered on 11 February 2020 by the Federal Service for Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the check could develop the results of the machine from 24th in order to detect COVID-19 infection, also received the results from the FDA from the highest level of the test. In addition, in March 13, 2020, the Rush Diagnostics will be reported 3.5 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued Emergency Usage Authority (EUA) for testing on the m2000 abbot system; the FDA first issued the same authority for Holological, Laboratory, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sheffield received a test from the FDA that took about 45 minutes for the same type.
FDA has approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require the sharpness of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18000 machines in the U.S. and the boot wants to increase production for 50,000 checks every day. A check kit is being developed in Taiwan with monoclonal resistance is being used in Tijulo 20 in Tijulo, which is particularly associated with this Newcastle Coronavirus Proclude.
In a March 2020 literature review, it concluded that "radiographing in the early stages is less clinical, while CT [Computed Tomography] findings may be available even before the beginning of the symptoms."
The specific characteristics of CT include bicycle multi-clover grade-glass opposition with temporary, inaccessible and rear distribution.
As the disease increases, the effects of subpleurial, crazial pewing and homogeneous are developed.
A study comparing the source point of current majority, compared with the CT of PCR in Wohan suggested that, despite being less specific than PCR, with many picture characteristics of CT similar to other immune and disease processes, it is more notably sensitive.
By March 2020, the U.S. College of Radioology recommends that "CT should not be used as a test or first line test for COVID-19 diagnosis." By March 2020, CDC recommends PCR for the primary test.
The part of the resistant reaction to infection includes the production of resistors including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to determine the resistance that begins in or around individuals 7 days after the beginning of symptoms and to detect people's monitoring infection. Testing can be done in Central Laboratory (CLT) or by Point-Off-Kear Testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of temporary blood for CLT is usually used, although the sample can be used to see the resistant reaction.
The single blood sample for PoCT is usually obtained from skin pancreas.
There is no requirement for the first examination step from different PCR methods. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 units that provided the Agency with information as required and thus are now able to deliver its resistant tests.
Until April 7, 2020, emergency use was approved by the FDA under the authority only the same test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and APTOP Diagnostics have copies of the examination of its test kits and have received the European approval of IgA
It has the ability to check hundreds of samples within a few hours and therefore it is quite faster than expecting the traditional PCR test of the viral RNA.
Usually, 14 days after the beginning of the infection of refugees can be detected. In early April, the UK found that any security check kit purchased by them was not good enough for use.
Hong Kong has planned to live in the home of the suspected patient, "Instantly the Department will provide the patient with sampling tubes", they will return to it and get the result of the investigation in a short time. Covidhar will get the result of the case. If the British NHS has announced that the case is going to take the case of the suspected, they begin to check the home of the suspected cases.
Drive-Tru Check Centers have helped to check the fastest, most widespread from any South Korean country. In Germany, the National Association of Statuary Health Insights was 10th in the Reply of Pyongyang700 in the capacity of Pyongyang and the Pyongyang in the embullation settings on March 2.
When the order of check is made by a doctor, the cost is charged by health insurance.
According to President Robert Coach Institute, Germany's total capacity is 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, the driver-trailer was offered in several major cities.
Until March 26, 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
In the first laboratory survey, it has been shown that a number of tests were checked at least 483,295 samples in the week 12/2020, including the week 12/2020, and a number of samples were checked at 33,491 (6.9%) and a number of tests was checked at SARS-CoV A, and a number of samples was checked at the same time as a number of samples.
With the supervision of the construction by Wang Jaon the founder of BGI and for 5 days, the model has been shown that if the ability to verify does not start, the number of cases in Hubei was 47% higher and the cost of managing quarantine was doubled.
Wohan's Ho-Yean Laboratory laboratories have immediately followed in Shenzhen, Triangle, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests every day. Multi-indicated open source forms have been issued by Origami Ass, which can be tested in more than 1122 tests using COVID19, which can be tested in less than 1122 tests without reducing the need of patients. These balanced patterns
Before March, the weaknesses and insufficient amounts of workers are in the EU, the UK and the US's high-level testing of problems.
It inspired some writers to find samples in which the next check includes warming samples up to 5 minutes to degradate the RNA genome to the next check. It also includes warming samples up to 5 minutes to increase the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) to the next gate to the next gate from the next gate to the next gate. It was announced March 31 that the United States
This was due to the ability to check drive-through and the combination of buying population-scale mass-through laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (Huo-Yan) based on emergency check laboratories in China.
In 14 days, the laboratory is able to test thousands of RT-PCR daily and is the first laboratory in the world to work at such high levels outside China.
Coronavirus Genetic Profile has been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States of America.
The World Health Organization has adopted and sent Germany's method to develop and build kits to countries with lack of resources.
The German method was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Digital Control was not available until January 28, making the availability of checks in the U.S. was delayed. The globalization of the country's debt and the debt of the U.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive availability of South Korean checks helped reduce the spread of the Novel Coronavirus.
Survey capacity, particularly in private labs, has been developed by the South Korean government over many years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that boosting research programmes is the best way to slow down the increase in COVID-19 pandemic. More demands have been checked due to the spread of the virus due to the fact that it has grown in the U.S. private laboratories. Thousands of examinations have been checked in the U.S.
In March 2020, China informed the problems of accuracy in its investigation kits.
In the United States, CDC had "comm" in check kits developed by CDC; the government had then removed such employment barriers that were blocking private checks. Spain had not been checking from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioji Biotechnology Company Ltd.
The company said that the wrong results may be due to failure in the correct use of samples or the correct use of kits.
The ministry of Spain said he would remove the wrong checking kits and replace the second check kit that was exploited by Shenzhen Bioji. 80% checked by the Czech Republic from China did not have the wrong checkkits, which were not given the wrong results. Slowakei was 1.2 payed to China
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be placed in Denmark. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that it was "high error rate" in check kits purchased by Turkey from China. They didn't use the payouts in 3.5. They didn't "use it" that the UK received from China April 2020.
After the investigation of people whose positive investigation came to discover their quarantaine and those whose positive contact came with SARS-CoV-2, they received positive results.
In the first place of the death of COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in the Vó Kasbe in Italy checked about 3,400 people twice in the total population at a time of about ten days.
There were no symptoms in about half of people with positive results, and all the cases found were quarantained.
New infections have been completely terminated by the prohibition of travel to the destination.
Exploring contact aggressively, by banning internal travel, checking and quarantaine, but 2020 Coronavirus Mayor in Singapore without shutting down strong restaurant and retail installations, such as quarantaine restrictions. Expecting other developed countries is quite slow
Several programs have been cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home from March 28, but the school was reopened on March 23 after a break.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also been managed to detect contacts aggressively, by banning internal travel, checking and quarantaine, but managed by less aggressive lockdown.
The statistical study found that the death rate of cases in countries in which the number of deaths has been more tested is very low, possibly because these countries are more capable of detecting people with only light or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries in which they are not able to investigate and whose national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19, they send one of the 16 reference laboratories of WHO's first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples for confirmation investigation.
Of 16 reference laboratories, 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% of the positive in the jackets" is influenced by the country's check policy.
In comparison with other things, a country where only hospitals are checked by people, there will be more positive checks than a country where all citizens are checked, whether they show symptoms or not.
Hand wash (or wash), which is also known as hand cleaning, is the task of cleaning your hands with the purpose of removing soil, oil, sausages or other unwanted substances.
During a day, any "necessary moments" regularly washing with soap prevents the spread of several diseases, for example, tough and haze, which are communicated by the pathway.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or normal periods, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or nose (i.e., slim gloves).
Five important moments during the day when washing with soap is important, they are: before and after the shower, cleaning or changing the baby's bottom, before eating, preparing and preparing raw meat, fish or meat and after eating.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned off. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before preparing dishes, during and later.
Before and after the treatment of the sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby using the toilet.
After scratching your nose, scratching or shaking.
After touching animals, animals, or animals' waste.
Medical hand cleanliness refers to cleanliness practices related to medical procedures.
Before providing medicine or medical care, hand washing can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand wash is to clean those patients (genuine, poisoning, or other oxygen that can cause disease) and to clean chemicals with hands that can cause damage or disease.
It is particularly important for people who care about food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for common people.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of the disease; reducing respiratory related infections;
In case of delivery at home, the rate of death of newborns is reduced.
A 2013 study found that children less than five years of age could improve their length increase from hands-washing practices.
In developing countries, simple emotional changes, such as soap-hand wash, can reduce the rate of child death associated with respiratory and dastial diseases.
This simple work can reduce the rate of death from these diseases to about 50%.
The measures that promote hand washing can reduce cases of the dough by almost a third, and it is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% deficiency in the case of dough can be associated with hand wash of soap. The only effective and cheap way to prevent dough and deep breathing infection (ARI) is to wash hands, wash hands, and behaviour as self-inspired in homes, schools and communities around the world.
A leading ARI, Nimonia is estimated to die 18 million children every year, and is the main cause of death in children under the age of five.
Nearly 35 million children have died due to disease and immunity.
According to UNICEF, washing the hand from the soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more life by making a strong habit from any TC or medical means, which may have the number of deaths to about half and deep breathing infection.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other cleaning arrangements as part of water, cleaning arrangements and cleaning (WASH) programs.
Hand wash is also a protection against impetigo that spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that the skin may be damaged by repeated hand washing due to the drying of the skin.
A Danish study in 2012 found that excessive hand-washing-free, layer-free skin status can be created, known as handed ecgyma or handed dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Many times, hand wash is also seen as a symptom of psychopath disorder (OCD).
Five important times during the day are when hand washing with the soap is important to reduce the transmission of the main path of the disease: after use of the toilet (small distribution, milk, etc.), before washing or preparing the baby's bones in the morning, before eating or eating, after eating (language change), and after eating the baby's bones.
Other possibilities when preventing the transmission of the disease should be exercised by the appropriate technique of washing hands: before or after treatment of a cut or wound; scratching, eating or digging your nose; touching the animals’ waste or handling the animals in the cloud; and touching the cows.
In many countries, the washing rate of soap is low.
In 2015, a study of hand wash found that the average rate of 38.7% of families adopted the practice of hand wash with soap. A study of 2014 showed that the rate of growth of children in Saudi Arabia was a highest rate of 97 per cent of availability. The rate of growth of children in Saudi Arabia was the highest rate of availability; the rate of growth in the United States was the highest rate of average; and China's 23 per cent
The "Required Health Care Program" implemented in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
This national program includes cleaning daily teeth from the original fluoride, as well as wash the hands from the soap, taking twice a year anti-karmitic treatment.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Mixing soap or detergent in water can be better removed from the skin.
The main action of soap and deterrents is to reduce barriers in swelling, and to increase solubility.
Lonely water is a cute skin constructer because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not easily dissolve in water.
Nevertheless, there is a sufficient flow of water in cleaning.
Due to repeated use of solid soaps, there may be remaining animals from previous uses.
Some studies that viewed the transfer of animals from infected solid soap have concluded that there is no possibility of the transfer due to smoke with the bulb of the animals.
However, according to CDC, "the liquid soap that falls on the soap is better than the remedies contained on the soap without removing the hands."
Protective soaps have been promoted for awareness-rated people on health.
To date, there is no evidence that antibiotic-antibiotics are produced in nature by the use of recommended antiseptics or chitanium agents.
Nevertheless, antibiotic soaps contain common antibiotic agents such as tricloson, with a comprehensive list of antibiotic races.
Therefore, even if anti-biotic soaps do not produce antibiotic resistant breeds, they can not be as effective as they are promoted to be effective.
In addition to the agent for the protection of the skin, the pH-regulator in regenerated contaminations is amal (sytic amal, ascorbic amal, lactic amal), the amal of amal, the amal of amal, the amal of aal, the amal of aal, the amal of aal, the amal of aal, the amal of aal, the amal of aal.
Comfortable hot water to wash hands is not hot enough to kill animals.
The body temperature (37 degrees Celsius) increases very quickly.
However, soil and vegetable natural oils to remove cold, warm, soap water is more effective than soap water.
However, unlike the popular concept, scientific studies have shown that using hot water does not have any effect on reducing the amount of sugars on hands.
A handmade sanitizer or handmade water-reaching cleaning agent is a handmade cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century round, alcoholic water-reached hand cleaning agent (jain alcohol-based hand rubber, kitanogenic hand rubber, or hand rubber) was also known as popularity.
Most of these are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which are used for easy use and to reduce the effect of drying alcohol, carbohydrate agents such as in a jail with multiples of acrylic almonds, or in a liquid such as a liquid or fork.
With the combination of hydrogen-peroxide, antiretroviral activity increases and increases. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% of alcohol are effective proteins.
Alcohol Rab Sanitazers are resistant to bacteria, multi-touch resistant organisms (MRSA and VRE), therapeutics and some toxins (HIV, Herpes, RSV, Rinovirus, Vaccine, Influenza and Hepatitis).
Alcohol Rab Sanitazer containing 70% alcohol destroys 99.97% of the genes after 30 seconds after placing (3.5 log deficiency, 35 decibel deficiency) and has the lowest effect of 1 minutes after placing. The effects of the genes are more than 99.99% and 99.999% deficiency.
Alcohol-based hand-based Sanitator Norovirus (or Norwoke) type of poisoning which are the most common causes of infectious gastrointestinal chout, are almost completely ineffective to both. Both hands should be fully swallowed or useless enough to cover.
The front and back of both hands and in the middle and in the middle, and all finger pores are stirred for about 30 seconds, until liquid, jail or jail is dried.
The pores of the fingers should also be well washed in both cages. The American Disease Control and Prevention Center recommends washing the hands instead of the hand sanitizer rubs, especially when the hand appears swollen.
The increasing use of these actors in their ease of use is based on rapid nasal activity against sugars; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper washing of hands until soap and water are unused.
Alcohol-based hand-based Sanitaire can cause dry skin repeatedly until the formula is not found in the skin molecules and/or molecules.
Glycerin and/or other fluids can be reduced or terminated by mixing the effect of drying alcohol in the formula.
In clinical trials, skin burning and dryness significantly decreased compared to soaps or antirobatic agents from hand-based Sneaker alcohol.
Contacts that produce allergic drugs in alcohol or alcoholic hands are dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity.
The underlying tendency to inspire thermatitis of contact disturbed with soap and water compared to washing hands has become an attractiveness.
Despite their effectiveness, agents without water do not cleanse organic substances from their hands, but simply reject them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of patients, as patients still stand in their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends much more on materials and materialization, and their performance is historically much lower than alcoholic and alcoholic rubbers.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which possibly: due to progressive adverse skin reactions has been shown to have decreased effectiveness after repeated use, has been shown to have persistent and complex immune reactions after using benzalconium chloride.
Many people in low-income communities can not buy soap and can use soap or soil instead.
Raw or soil can be more effective than alone water, but can be less effective than soap.
A concern is that if soil or rain is infected with sausages, it can increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing the spread of the disease.
Like the soap, the rake is also a chitanium agent because it creates an alkaline villain in contact with water.
When soap isn't available, the WHO recommends the soap or rain as the option of soap.
U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centers for Disease Prevention include the following steps in the correct hands-washing technique:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
The water is recommended because the water gases with stable water can be contaminated, although there is no difference between the water temperature.
Make the right amount of soap, including the fingers and nails, on the back of the hands, with a fold on the hands.
Soap removes cells from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more fully when using soap instead of water alone.
Wait for at least 20 seconds.
It is caused by rupture, which helps to remove ruptures from the skin, and more rupture is removed for more time.
Wash well under the water.
The laundering of the hands can be infected again.
Dry or dry in the air with a clean towel.
Naked and naked hands are easily re-infected. The most distracted areas are below the area between fingers, rings, and nails.
Artificial nails and clip-shaped nails can add to the polyesters.
Mushrooming lotion is often recommended to save hands from drying; dry skin can damage the skin that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where water and/or soap are not available, where necessary, various low-cost options can be made to make hand washing comfortable, for example, from a slightly delicate barbecue in other regions, such as the positions in the regions or the regions available-size-size-size-size-size-size-size-size-size-size.
Tippy-Tap is a simple technique that uses a lever operated from a foot to put a slight amount of water on the russi world, and to put the hands and soap to a small amount of water on the toes.
Hands effectively drying is an essential part of the cleaning process of hand, but some of the most effective disputes of drying in public toilets.
Large-scale research shows that paper towels provide more cleanliness than many electric hand drivers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, which was organized by the European Travel Symposium, with the aim of Paper Towels, Hot-Wave Drills, and Modern Jet-Aids.
The total number of animals after hand-washing and drying with hot air has increased by 194% on the potatoes and 254% on the potatoes.
The average number of genes with Jet-Air Dryer has increased by 42% in the potatoes and 15% in the potatoes by drying with Jet-Air Dryer.
After hand-washing and drying with paper towels, the average number of animals decreased to 76% in the eggs and to 77% in the helmets. Scientists also tested the ability of the equipment to install it.The use of the other equipment as a result of the method of each type of drying.
Jet-air dryer, which is estimated at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph) removes air from the unit at an estimated speed, flying dry living from hands and units and possibly other toilet users and possibly 2 meters away.
From the dryer to 0.25 meters of dryer with hot-heat hand dryer, the sweat-life has spread.
Paper Towel did not show any significant spread of the sux-jives. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of drying hands were evaluated.
The following changes in the calculation of animals were observed after drying hands:
There are many different handdryers manufacturers, and compared to handdryers is made with drying paper towels.
In the absence of soap and water during the journey, hand wash is an option to use the hand-washing vips.

There are electronic equipment that provide feedbacks to give hospital employees to remember to wash their hands when they forget.
In a study, the rate of infection by using them has decreased.
The hands are medically washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, in which the soap and water or jail are made with a proper amount of soap or jail and each part of the hands is stirred up.
The rings of both hands should be stirred together.
If there are underneath the nails, it can be used to remove a hard-hair brush.
Since the chicken can stay in water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towels.
After drying, the water should be used to shut down the paper towel (and, if necessary, any removal door should be opened).
It protects them from being re-infected by the hands of those surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands in the healthcare system is to remove and prevent patients from communicating with them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine report, most of the medical environments have not been washed hands on irreversible levels, with large numbers of medical and nurse patients being regularly forgotten to wash their hands before touching.
A study has shown that the rate of blood flow related to cateter can be lower to 66 per cent from proper hand-washing and other simple processes. The World Health Organization has standard hand-washing and hand-round performance in healthcare areas. A paper published
The guidelines to the cleanliness of the hands available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comments.
A relevant review was reviewed by Vitby and others.
If necessary, the performance of Vianam's compliance may measure and certify the purity of the hand.
The World Health Organization has set "five opportunities" to wash hands:
After contact with blood/body fluids
prior to the work of Ketanu-Nasaki, and
After the patient's care. It provides the ability to kill the hand-washing agent to add chemicals to the soap ("medical" or "medical" soap).
Before acting or in a arrangement that contains antibiotic resistant organisms very wide, such bulking capacity may be desired. The bulking capacity may be desired. For the bulking of the bulking of the bulking of the bulking of the arms and the arms of the bulking of the arms, to be "sleeved" after the arms and the arms of the bulking of the bulking, to be a nozzled or a nail that has been removed from the arms.
All jewelry should be removed.
In this process, it is usually necessary to wash hands and garlics up to 2-6 minutes.
There is no need for a long period of time (10 minutes).
During the washing, water should be stopped from coming back on the hands.
After completion of the washing of hands, the hands are dried with a cute fabric and wear a surgical garment.
In order to reduce the spread of chickens, it is better to use a hand wash before and after the care of a sick person or to use a hand chicken.
For the control of stephylococcus infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning came from 20% first, and when the frequency of hand cleaning increased by 35%, there was very little extra benefit.
With hand wash with soap, the rate of migration of animal contagious disease is more than three times compared to the washing of animal-resistant soap. The rate of migration of animal infectious disease is more than three times compared to the washing of animal-resistant soap. It gets more than 6% of the washing of animal-resistant soap than the washing of animal-resistant soap.
But with hands, H1N1 Influence A viruses and chloride disabled beans are more effective than soap and water-based hand rubbers. Healthcare arrangements can improve the healthcare system, the workforces in the workforces, the workforces in the hands-to-be-heavyness of the workforces and the hands-to-be-heavyness of the workforce
More research is needed on which of the most effective measures in the various healthcare systems.
In developing countries, soap wash with hands is considered a good health, and even a cost-effective, necessary tool for obtaining good nutrition.
However, it is a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior by the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces.
For example, every private or public toilet in Africa is very low, even though there are cheap options to make a hand wash station.
However, it can also be due to the customs caused by lower hand washing rates, soaps or water shortages.
Promoting hand washing and support can affect political decisions, increase awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to changes in the long-term behaviour of the population.
To work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective on the rise in hand washing in LMICs, while the campaign of social promotion is less effective. For example, it is the "three star methods" method to promote hand washing with the need for other tools in the schools.
When the minimum standard is achieved, the school order can reach one to three stars.
Making hand wash stations can be part of the promotions of hand washing campaigns that are made to reduce the rate of disease and hair death.
World Hand Smoking Day is another example of the campaign to increase awareness, aimed at trying to change behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji of hand wash.
Some studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand wash in developing countries in relation to DALYs' protection.
However, a review shows that promoting hand wash with soap is much more cost-effective than other water and cleaning measures.
The importance of washing the hands for human health - especially people with sensitive circumstances, such as mothers who have given birth to the child or injured in hospitals - in the first time in the soldiers in the hospitals - in the Tang Soldiers in the 19th century,Tanganya was the first time in the ranking of the 19th century, who was the hand washed in the midst of the 19th century, who was identified by two proverters of cleaning.
At that time, most people believed that the infection was caused by miscarriage called Miasmus.
In the 1980s, food public prokop and health-related infections inspired the U.S. disease control and prevention center to more actively increase hands cleanliness as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
In 2009, the spread of Swain's flu and in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic increased awareness of the importance of hand washing from soap to protect such contagious diseases in many countries.
For example, the poster with "right washing techniques" was trapped near hand wash sink in public toilets and office buildings and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase “wash your hands” means taking the responsibility of the thing or declaring your desire to believe the mistress in it.

After the use of toilets in Hindu religion, Jewish religion and Islamic religion, hand wash is necessary.
And Hindu religion, Buddhist religion, Sikh religion, Jewish religion and Islam religion is necessary to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infections at work
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infections at workplace, preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), applying professional safety and health systems for risk controls.
Depends on the proper control of the risk of spreading the disease at workplace, workplaces and tasks carried out, which assess the risk of contact sources, the seriousness of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual employees who are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Business Security and Health Administration (OSHA), there is minimal business contact with people and other co-workers in low-risk functions, for which basic infection prevention measures are carried out. The management and management of the operations are recommended to regulate, protect them, including: washing hands, washing hands
Medium-risk activities are those for which it is necessary to make contacts repeatedly or closely with people who do not know or doubt that COVID-19 is infected, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community communication or international travel.
They include the burden whose contact with the general public is such as schools, high-speed working environments, and some high-speed sales arrangements.
In addition to basic measures of prevention of infections, this group includes risk control measures: the use of high-performance air filters, snowguards, and keeping personal security equipment available for that situation if the COVID-19 infected person has to face.
OSHA deems that health workers and deceased home employees are at high risk of contact with a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and that is increasingly at high risk of contact if a disease has COVID-19 infected or suspected person.
In controls of appropriate risks for these employees such as engineering controls include personal security equipment suitable for conversation room and function.
There may be a number of impacts of COVID-19 spreads within the workplace.
Disease, the need to care for others or fear of possible contact may be absent from miscarriage work.
What is the demand for goods, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as purchasing through low demand time or delivery or driving-fire services), can change the form of trade both in relation to them.
Finally, COVID-19 can be affected by the voice of objects from seriously affected geographical areas. Preparation and response plans can be used to guide protective functions for an infectious disease.
The plans address the levels of risks associated with various jobs and jobs, including risk factors arising from the source of risk, home and social arrangements, and the risks of individual employees such as ageing or old medical situations.
They also refer to the controls necessary to deal with the risks and random plans for those circumstances, which may result in the profoundness.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or international recommendations.
The aim of the response to a breakthrough includes: reducing communication between employees, protecting people with high risk of negative health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative effects on other units in the supply chain.
The seriousness of the disease in the business community affects the reactions that are taken into account.
The sequence of risk controls is a structure that is widely used to create a group of risk controls according to the effectiveness of professional safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be ended, there are the most effective control engineering control, then administrative control and ultimately personal security equipment.
In engineering controls, employees include separating from the risks related to work without depending on the behavior of the offence, and this may be the most affordable solution in applying.
Administrative control functions are changes in policies or processes for which an employer or employer requires action.
Personal security equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
Choosing all types of PPEs based on the dangers of employees, correctly putting on (such as breathing plants), constantly and properly wearing, regularly checking, maintaining and removing equipment, and correctly removing or cleaning as required.
According to the U.S. Business Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk contact functions have minimal business contact with people and other co-workers.
Recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include: repeated and well-washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are ill, managing tools to be sick, managing the tools to be used, managing the curve and shaping the curve, managing and shaping the breathing, and toughness
It is an important step for the protection of employees, customers, visitors and other employees to quickly identify and disseminate potential infectious persons at work.
U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of severe vomiting disease, stay at home until they have any symptoms that reduce the fever, or other symptoms that have any family-changing or other drugs that have at least 24 hours of the fever and the fever.
According to OSHA, intermediate contact functions include activities for which it requires repeated or close contact with people within six feet (1.8 m), whose COVID-19 is unknown or suspected to be infected, but the crossing may be internationally, but the crossing may be the cause of COVID-19, because the crossing of the individuals may be around the space SA-Community-Community-communicating
They include the powers that provide the powers that are connected to the general public, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers, powers that provide the powers and powers.
In this risk group, employees need the use of breathing plants virally.
If a person gets ill on an airplane, employees and other passengers are included in appropriate controls for the safety of the person: distance the sick person to 6 feet from others, calling a member of the driver for the service of the sick person, calling a member of the sick person to be sick, and calling the sick person to beat on a face or make his face mask or insurance.
The driver's side should wear useable medical gloves when he touches the fluids of the body or potentially infected surfaces, and if the sick passenger has a fever, a constant protection, or a difficulty in breathing, then potentially unlikely.
A towels and other useable items should be handled in a pocket, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and contaminated later. When cruise ships and other passengers travel to ships, such as passengers or ships, to be transported on a ship or to be transported to a commercial vessel, and controls of dangers
Ideally, medical monitoring should be carried out in the room of the affected person. For schools and children's care facilities, it is recommended to shut off promptly in the CDC if any infected person is undergoing a procedure for social communication.
When there is a minimal medium-sized social movement, strategies to make social distances can be applied, such as area tours, meetings and other major meetings such as physical education or singing classes or use of food in the areas of workplaces and restaurants. Cancel foods in the area of workplaces, increase the distance between the tables, and fire
When there is adequate communication in the local community, it can be considered on extended school holidays in addition to social distancing strategies. For everyday law enforcement employees, the immediate health risk is at risk by CDC
Law enforcement officials who have been in contact with confirmed or suspected persons of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines of emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal security equipment.
If there is close contact during the arrest, employees should re-use their duty belt and equipment: before use, clean and clean by using domestic cleaning sprays or blades, and use PPE anti-processing and handling processes.
OSHA believes some health care and deceased home employees are in high or very high risk categories.
Providing, assisting, providing healthcare in high-risk functions include laboratory and medical transport carmies that come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high contact risk if they do processes that generate aerosol in known or suspected patients of COVID-19, collect or handle samples.
The processes generated by aerosol include input, cough inhalation processes, broncoscopes, some dental processes and examinations, or samples from chir-phase.
People with high contact risk are involved in the activities of deceased homes who prepare the body of known or suspected persons of COVID-19 during their death; if they test the body, they become very high contact risks during the test, risks to covid-19, or risks to coagulation processes for these risk groups.
Some health care and deceased-home arrangements may be appropriate for a particular negative sound.
Samples should be handled with 3 levels of biosecurity caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that future patients, depending on whether they are a suspicious COVID-19 case, are separated in different expectations areas. Other PPE processes are also treated as part of the processes which are treated as part of the 6th processes,OSA-recommended as part of the SA-V-recommended for individuals.
In the United States, NIOSH approved N95 filtering fascists or better should be used in a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes fit-tests, training and medical exams.
Other kinds of respiratory plants can provide more safety and improve the refreshment of weakness. WHO does not recommend coverings, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being communicated via physical fluid.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening employees at the entrance place.
For those who are collecting samples related to breathing from COVID-19 patients without aerosol processes, their care or transport, WHO recommends a surgical mask, shielding, chong, and towels.
If a process is produced by aerosol, the surgical mask is changed to N95 or FFP2 respiratory.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO allows the use of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, only allowing people involved in direct care to enter a room without the use of PPE with one COVID-19 patient, allowing the use of several individuals without the need to enter a room, and only use a number of specific tasks necessary for PPE.

This month there are exceptional circumstances around us.
The COVID-19 Mayor has explained to them to be connected to all humans in the world and to each other our responsibilities.
Its challenges are unsuccessful for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global cohesion, mutual cooperation, and community fuel, which is at the center of this organization.
We have seen the kind of sympathy among all our co-workers on email, calls and chat, which proves that we have the opportunity to work with extraordinary people.
I'm so grateful and proud that you can't say it in words.
Last week, one person shared the honor of our work with me.
He reminded me of how important it is to move towards the world’s Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to make this extremely important resource available online and for all.
Your work only makes it possible, whether you are running the sites, or being the source of our employees' wages, or safeguarding our communities.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it is most necessary.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way to do it, will have a meaningful impact on both the world.
Because of this mission, and because of your role, we are going to change some significant changes in how to work with us this next week.
Changes in our work and timelines
As Robin said earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our method and prepare the time-consuming of the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time in our thoughts on the present situation, which was the appropriate response to us.
We were enthusiastic and we wanted to remove stress and we wanted to cooperate with our mission for a long time.
If you have to lose your job, there's nothing wrong with it.
For all staff, connectors, and connectors:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week to the next notice.
We are not declaring vacation - if you are able to work more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, at this time, the world is unexpected, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, bring goods to rent, or go to a doctor, your effectiveness is our priority.
We don't count on your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don't need to say that, but we're saying that.
There is no need for a disease holiday or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team to change the calendar and timeline so that you can make sure that the main area of the work looks at no one.
(If you have confirmed the COVID-19 occurrence, please inform T&amp;C's brewing so that T&amp;C can help you and ensure that appropriate attention is given to your management.)
The employees will receive full wages on Saturday.
We have already said, and we are once again announcing the commitment to fulfilling our promises given to our connectors and clock staff.
Each person will receive wages based on his general work hours during normal circumstances.
If you're sick and can't work, you'll get paid.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get out of the stress related to the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfied, especially at such a time.
Once again, you need to take care of yourself.
We have to say that you talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can change it accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things that we can’t stop.
SRE, HR ops, trust and security, and grant support teams (and others) are doing very important tasks that may require additional cooperation.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate existing objectives and focus our attention on cooperating with essential things for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we will focus on all the most necessary projects.
We're going to get rid of the injury later.
There is no plan for our "doubling time" after the crossing of the Global Maharashtra.
You will no longer be expected to perform additional hours to complete the unrealistic time limits.
We believe that the circumstances have changed, and we will work there where appropriate to determine new goals and time limits.
What will happen with the APP (annual planning)?
To be adapted with the expectations of our new reality and day-to-day work hours, we want to re-change our 2020-2021 annual plan in the time limit.
Our intention is to offer an extension of our 2019-2020 plan so that we will take more time to make a budget, so that employees will give priority to their very important tasks, self-care, and care of their loved ones at the time to do or to take care of them in the next few weeks.
This extension of Time-Cama will bring a good-scale decrease in our current planning function and pressure in the entire organization.
We will put our proposal in front of the Board of Directors next week and when we receive confirmation, we will inform representatives and teams about the next steps.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership.
Office status, contact, and cleaning
Last week we found out that our SF-based co-worker may have been in contact with the COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, with a lot of caution, we have undertaken anti-virus cleaning cards to decentralize all the surfaces of the San Francisco Office.
He decreased every surface, Lobby, and the elevator bank that came to our Floor from the anti-viral cliff of the hospital.
It is implementing its own care-to-dependence protocol using products that support the safety of its residents in the building.
We believe that when we return, the office will be fully ready.
Our DC Office is located in a WeWork (WeWork) that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC staff members.
Last week, a completely remote arrangement was mistaken in accordance with the guidelines shared by our DC Office in San Francisco.
As some of our NYC co-workers know, there is also a discussion on taking a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions may continue, but there may be an excitement.
Some of our co-workers are working from home for the first time.
Our co-workers who have long been working at home/at home know that need to be adjusted to this, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to an increase of more than one or two hours.
If you need a long and long session, consider them sharing in a few days.
Define the meetings clearly, prepare the agency, and send the reading content already.
Create your default video with the help of Google Docs and Zoom tools to make live cooperation and combination sound.
Initiate each meeting to make it comfortable, monitor a person's chat for questions and keep the speaker's list in mind, and help a person take notes (or take notes in mutual cooperation)
If you need a comfortable headset, send a tech support email.
Use your health benefits for alphacare.
Connect to #remoties channel in Slack (Slack) to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work.
HR Operations Team is investigating webinar-based employment guidance to cooperate in the increases distributed in the entire foundation.
Last week, we called on public programmes financed by Wikimedia from all customers receiving community grants, such as Adithathon, etc., to cancel until the WHO announces the end of the Global Marriage.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to fulfill their mutual-consensus grant activities, and that no one will be punished for the effort to be discouraged or amended in these objectives.
This next week we will follow with additional guidance in relation to Wikimedia and other regional and topical community conferences.
Because of this obstacle, the feeling of suffering in the entire global community has to appear extensively, but there is also a sense of clarity and relievedness of focusing on their own communities, on Wikimedia and otherwise.
Continuing, monitoring the impact and tracking our communications with them, the community is working to organize a page on CRT met-witch.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting to each other.
We are together in these situations and are present to help as much as possible.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information on the Office Viki, and all other necessary information about COVID-19.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and will keep all the information in one place.
We are also working at this time to maintain regular communication with employees living in affected countries.
If you have something to ask about travel, programs, major functions, or the challenge related to the quartet, or you need to help with anything else, please inform the Controller CRT and work with it.
We are present to provide assistance as needed and help in establishing relationships.

Angiotensin-variant enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the external surface of cells in membranes, mucus, heart, bones and guts.
ACE2 balances the activity of the related enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and enhancing angiotensin (1-7), which also has the function in the form of the membrane2 of the membrane. Aspirative medication for the treatment of heart-related diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is referred to as the primary hACE2.
Angiotensin-variant enzyme 2 is a zinc methoenyme contained on the surface of other cells.
ACE2 proteins include N-terminal peptide M2 domains and C-terminal collector amino-viral transporter domains.
ACE2 is a fluent protein that once passes through with an active enzyme with an active domain on the surface of the cells in fever and other tissues.
The external biological domain of ACE2 is devastated by other enzymes called Shedesh, the transylli domain, and as a result, soluble protein is released into blood flow and ultimately emitted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with aerial cells of type II of fever, small-intestinal anthrocytes, bulbs and bulbs, and in most organs of bulbs, as well as commal bulbs of bulbs.
The ACE2 mRNA detection is also found in the brain, straetam, hypothalamus and brain columns.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a function of ACE.
ACE destroys angiotensin I hormone in vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2 then destroys carbonoxyl-terminal aminophenylenin from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and has it vah-extensive angiotensin (1-7), (H-H-Asp-Arg-Val-OH)
ACE2 [des-Arg9]-Bredycaine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and glycerin can also destroy many other peptides.
ACE2 is also controlled by the SLC6A19 bulb transportation and its role has been reported in Hartnerp Disease.
As a parazillate protein, ACE2, HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-producing viruses); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-producing viruses) function as the main entry point for cells, including some of the coronavirus viruses.
More particularly, on the surface of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 counterprotein S1 cells, both viruses and enzymes are transferred from the ACE2 enzyme domain to the endocytosis and endosoms located within the cells.
Nutritional serum protease TMPRSS2 for this entry process also requires the removal of S protein, whose inhibition is subject to current examination as possible medicine. Because of this, some people have conceived that it can help to mitigate ACE2 levels in cells.
However, many professional institutions and regulators have recommended that standard ACE inhibitors and ARB treatment continue.
The methodological review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors compared to controls was associated with a significant 34% deficiency in the risk of nimonia."
"In patients treated with ACE inhibitors, the risk of immunity also decreased, which were at a high risk of immunity, especially in people with injury and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decline in the mortality rate associated with Nimonia, although the results were lower than the overall risk of Nimonia."
Reusable human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new treatment for severe damage to the fever, and lipopolysacaride-inspired severe respiratory impact syndrome in pigs with fluctuation in infants.
In humans, rhACE2 has about 10 hours of half-life and the start of action is 30 minutes with 24 hours of effect process (hours).
Many suggest that rhACE2 may be a predictive medication for people with inadequate system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases involving trafficking. Treatment valued in rhACE2 is increased to rhACE2. Strength respiratory disorders
COVID-19 App Mobile Software Applications, which are designed to help track the contact tracking in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals (“communications”) that may be in contact with any infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
Several forms have been developed for the construction of contact tracking apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly about systems that are based on the tracking of the geographical situation of users.
In a low-interview option, a user includes the use of Bluetooth signals to log close to another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would directly integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has planned an app in combination with Alipay, allowing citizens to check whether they are in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a TraceTogether app is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was issued as an open source and will be sent to the government. North Macedonia has detected contact with potentially infected individuals and locked out health authorities. A bluetooth-based “Top to provide quick response!”
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the Government said contact tracking app was in an advanced stage of development, and will be available for planning within weeks. The same app (“StopCovid”) was also planned in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering the TraceTogether App and BlueTrace Protocol based apps. They don't want to present a geofensing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Russia in Moscow. They are not out of the house, which is designed to ensure that it is
The professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge listed many potential practical problems with app-based systems, which include wrong-positive cases and if the use of the app is limited to only a small portion of the population.
When dealing with concerns about the spread of the "coronavirus" apps, Apple only limited to "official" or otherwise respected organizations, determining what kind of organizations may include in its App Store. Include the apps related to the coronavirus.
Google and Amazon have implemented the same restrictions.
Privacy actors have expressed their concerns about large-scale monitoring agents using the coronavirus apps, particularly whether the coronavirus will be made to deal with the supervisory structures that will be made to deal with large-scale coronavirus. Do not go through this threat.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for such supervision boundaries.
The organizations declared eight conditions on government projects:
Monitoring must be "legal, necessary and identical";
A complete section should be made for monitoring and monitoring extensions;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and innocence should be protected and protected on the basis of the certificate;
Digital monitoring should be avoided by promoting misleading and injustice;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in the law;
Protecting the rights of citizens to respond to abuse and abuse must be taken;
All "Support Partnership" will be required by public health experts and unrighteous groups, including all "relevant stakeholders". The German Cao Computing Club (CCC) and reporters are Deputy Boards (Reporter Ohn Greenen) (RSF) also.
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan, when it is not required, is to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems.
Some countries used network-based localization tracking by ending both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have jurisdiction to updated location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, all central server systems do not require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems have been created that only use central servers for mutual communication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to track contact in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system has collected tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to generate information from potentially infected individuals through text messages.
In addition to the use of this information to notice potential contacts, the government has publicly provided information about the location due to telecommunications changes in the privacy laws after the MERS dismissal in that country.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites. Many countries including Germany have considered the use of centralized and privacy protection systems.
By April 6, 2020, these details have not yet been published.
Privacy-defense contact tracking with a large body of research literature from at least 2013 is a built-in concept. Up to April 7, 2020, more than a dozen of experts have been working on privacy-conforming solutions to make use of Bluetooth, such as one user’s nicktails from other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort that includes both centralized and centralized methods of the kind, and it does not have a protocol. It has centralized privacy for the centralized protocol. It has other contact-protection protocols (progressive contact-progressive,progressive,progressive,progressive,progressive,progressive,progressive,progressive,progressive,progressive)
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never gets out of the device, and all are on the mixed device.
MIT Media Lab is developing the privacy group SafePaths, which is a platform for collecting and using privacy-protection techniques for local or pathway data to track COVID-19 distribution.
It is based on the research of the "Apps Gon Rog: Maintening Personal Privacy in this Epidemic" issued in March 2020. The same effort to develop privacy technology is based on Enigma MPC SafeTrace, which was originally established by MIT Media
SafeTrace uses secure hardware techniques that allow the user to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and officials without contracting the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the establishment of the Global TCN Organization was made by groups, which were necessarily organized in relation to the same approach and large-scale protocols. A priority was to minimize the goal of achieving the default, the goal of achieving the default, and the implementation of the tracking and caution.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace Protocol to be used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms have announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claimed that it is Bluetooth the following energy technology and privacy-protective cryptography combination. Confidentiality based on the combination of cryptography
He also published the specifications of the main techniques to be used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is expected to be available in three stages:
Provide tools to enable governments to create coronavirus tracking apps for official privacy protection
assemble this functionality directly in iOS and Android
The medication (which is also known as re-use, re-prophylaxing, re-prophylaxing or therapeutic change), for which it was originally developed, is a approved medication for the treatment of different diseases or medical condition.
This is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research instructions include the development and health-related plasma bases of a COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 contains nearly 66 target proteins, each of which has a number of liland binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable project to develop effective antiviral drugs for protection from COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helixes, S proteins and ADP ribofosfates.
Husan and others studied several candidate compounds, which then recommended in a clinical study structure for an effective pre-clinical study for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in order to accelerate the development of the most similar reconciliation with the most approved drugs.
Chloroquin is a malaria-resistant drug that is also used to protect against some self-defense diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine will be one of the four drugs to be studied as part of the clinical trial of Solidarity.
The New York Governor Andrew Qumo announced that the tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the New York State will begin on March 24. On March 28, FDA made emergency use of hydroxychloroquine under excessive use of chlorochloroquine (EUA)
Treatment has not been approved by the procedure of FDA clinical trials and it is only authorised under the US as an experimental treatment for emergency use in those patients who are prescribed in hospital but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
CDC said that the use, dosage or period of hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention or treatment has not yet been installed.
The doctors said they are taking the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research party in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Duke University and Oxford University are undergoing large studies.
NYU Langon Medical School is testing on the safety and effectiveness of the contrary use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wohan and Shenzhen have claimed that Fevipyravir was "clearly effective."
Negative tests were conducted on average for 4 days of 35 patients in Shenzhen, while 11 days were conducted in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with Nemony in Wohan, half of patients were received feviravir and half of omifenovirus.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence in support of the drug is very small and initial.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy drugs from Japan for its warehouse, and the army would use to deliver drugs to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Shandong Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. This drug can be less effective in serious cases of disease, where the virus has already been secreted.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir (cattra), concluded that "no benefit was seen."
The drugs were created to prevent HIV from being reproduced by protease.
A party of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will link SARS-CoV-2 processes. Scientific communities are particularly related to HIV/AIDS resource development. Reproduction of drugs that are developed in the community
WHO has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was manufactured and developed by Giliad Cyncez as a treatment of Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Giliad Cyncez later discovered that several Filo-, Neuroma-, Paramco- and Paramco- in Remdesivir were protected for Remdesivir.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through changes, which can cause more serious diseases and transmissions.
Some preliminary pre-examination studies show that there may be a high biological obstacle to resistance in remedecivir. There are many clinical tests conducting, including two tests operated by Cleveland University Hospital. Two tests with Bma; for one and more people with intermediate diseases.
There are three clinical tests of vitamin C running in the hospital with COVID-19 and intakes for seriously ill people; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without control (in Italy).

Tests also in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 TC is a conceptual TC for protection from COVID-19 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although none of the TCs have completed the clinical tests, there are still many attempts to develop such TCs.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it is not expected to be available in less than 18 months of a TC for safety from SARS-CoV-2, the disease-generating virus.
Five candidates were in the first stage of safety studies in April.
Covid-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a large scaffold spread around the world, making a lot of investment and research activities to develop TCA.
Several organizations are using the generosity published by SARS-CoV-2 to develop potential technicians for security.
As stated in April, the CEPI initiative's mandatory priorities for TCA development is the speed, production capacity, large-scale planning and global regulation.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were subject to research and development during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective action for security against COVID-19.
Step I Security Studies include the advanced main platform goals:
Nuclinic Oil (DNA and RNA) (Stage I Developer and Teca Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Step I Developer and Techca Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 vector)
As reported by the CEPI scientists in April, 115 total candidates are in the initial stage of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (according to the Milken Institute 79), and 37 other plans are stated, but are not publicly available.
In a phase I-II test, initial safety and resistance tests are performed, it is usually done on random, placebo-controlled and several locations by prescribing more accurate, effective doses.
Step III tests generally include more participants, with a control group monitoring adverse effects on the maximum dose, and testing the efficacy of TC for disease prevention.
Of 79 of the TCA candidates in active development (verified in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human assessment (also were in "preventional" research).

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities, combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing resources, collected resources for supercomputers from IBM to IBM.
There are some toxic effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have the additional benefits of the disease they prevent.
Another random test in Australia says 4,170 healthcare workers are being dismissed.
It is possible that TKs will not be safe or effective in development.
Covid-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic species, other laboratory animals and non-human priorities, have initial research to assess the effectiveness of the TC for the protection of the needs of the vaccine, to ensure the protection of the surviving virus processes and the standard of bio-protection levels
Non-human animal models have tested Ticks for protection from SARS and MERS.
By 2020, there is no treatment or protective action for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new drugs and drugs for SARS treatment was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is no certificate for security from MERS.
When MERS was widespread, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful snack to develop TC and treatment for security from a MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, a (DNA-based) MERS TEC was a TEC that completed Stage I clinical tests in humans, and there are three other advances, all of which are viral-weighted TEC, two adenoviral-weighted (ChAdOx1-MERS), BVRS-GamVac, and MVA.
Social media posts have promoted a conference claiming that he knew about the responsible COVID-19 virus and that a TC was already available.
The patents referred to by various social media posts refer to other races such as the coronavirus patents and SARS for the existing indigenous sequences.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, pancreas, and breathing flowers.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, pancreas, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, sensation of smell and stomach pain.
The time from the arrival of the virus to the beginning of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can even be between two and fourteen days.
Although the symptoms are mild in most cases, in some cases viruses and multi-organ failures develop.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed. The virus spreads mainly among people during narrow contact, prey: through small drops generated by scratching, scratching, or talking.
Although these drops are caused by breathing out, they usually fall on soil or surfaces instead of being infectious in a long distance.
People can also be infected by touching a smellful surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on surfaces for 72 hours.
This is the most contagious during the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, although the symptoms may occur before and after the stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is from a real-time transition (reversibilityPr.) has a polymeration remission RT.
It is recommended to use masks for people who are suspected of being infected with the virus and also for their eye-catching fans.
Recommendations of use of masks by the general public are different, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of diseases in most countries in all six WHO regions has been introduced.
People infected with the virus may be noticeable or may develop flu-weight symptoms such as fever, swelling, fatigue and breathing.
Difficulty to breathe in emergency symptoms include constant chest pain or pressure, irritation, difficulty to wake up and blue faces or mouths; it is recommended to obtain immediate medical care when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory path can be seen such as dizziness, nose burning or injury in the neck.
Symptoms of intestinal disorders, such as ulcers and ulcers, have been seen in different percentages.
In some cases in China, only breast crashes and rapid crashes were seen at the beginning.
In some cases, the disease can increase immunity, multi-organ failure and death.
It is called the original period.
The outbreak period for COVID-19 usually lasts from five to six days, but it can last from two to 14 days.
Symptoms are developed within 11.5 days of infection in 97.5% of individuals developing symptoms. The information shows that not all infected individuals have developed symptoms.
The role of these distinctive carriers in transmission is still not fully known; however, initial evidence indicates that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, about which the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has reported that 20% of all confirmed cases have been observed during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include distinctive cases in its daily cases on April 1; on that day 130 (78%) of 166 infections were distinctive during the test.
Both Bulgam and Lar may have a large amount of viruses.
There are more drops out of talking in a loud voice than talking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that drops from 4,5 meters to 15 ft can be produced without shade.
Although this virus is not generally ventilated, the National Academy of Sciences said bioerosol transmission could be possible and there was a positive issue for sampled viral RNA from air collectors taken out of the rooms.
Some medical processes such as input and heart Phyphosphatic Medicine (CPR) can cause breathing to become aerosol and thus air proliferation.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through the milk, it is considered less risk. It is the most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread is possible before the symptoms emerge, but its risk is less.
The European Center for Disease Control and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals. It survives hours to days on the surfaces of the virus.
In particular, one day the virus was found to be detected on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and 99% for up to four hours on the canvas.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soaps and unused products are also effective; soaps are disabled by breaking down the fat protective layer of the viruses, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other rabbits, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorheoxidine gluconet (one shalyacria kitanunasic), are less effective. In a study of Hong Kong, Lar's samples were taken on average two days after the start of pregnancy in the hospital.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest amount of viruses, and six patients showed the highest amount of viruses on the second day of the test.
Several severe respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe severe respiratory syndrome Coronavirus, which was first associated with the group of severe respiratory diseases in the vagina.
All features of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective surface. SARS-CoV-2 is related to the rigidity of the original SARS-CoV.
Feeds are the most influential organs of COVID-19 because the viral enzyme enters from the variation enzyme 2 (ACE2) to nutrient cells, which are the most common in the type II of feeds.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotine called "contact" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
12% of people who have been infected in the hospital in China have suffered severe heart damage and it is more common in severe disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to the daily response and disorders of the immune system during the progression of the disease, but severe myocardial damage can also be associated with ACE2 patients in the heart.
ACE2 has an excessive manifestation in the heart and is involved in the work of the heart.
High spread of thrombosis (31%) and Venus thromboembolyse (25%) in patients with COVID-19 infections have been found, which may be related to poor disease diagnosis. Also, the body of people who die from COVID-19 is exacerbated.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a consequence of ACE2 detection of the respiratory pathway for abdomen cells, there are symptoms of daily hypertension in severe COVID-19 patients.
In particular, patients with GM-CSF-slab T-cells have been associated with the selection of IL-6-slab monocytes and severe disease of fever in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the test.
The WHO has published a number of testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is the real-time reverse transition polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is typically performed on samples related to breathing obtained by a nasal fae; however, a sample of a nose fae or bolgam can also be used.
The results are usually available within two days of a few hours.
Blood tests can be used, but for them two blood samples are required within two weeks and the immediate value of the results is lower.
The Chinese scientists were able to disclose a spending of the coronavirus and publish an inorganic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymer chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
Until April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can find out whether an active infection was previously infected) were in development, but have not been widely used yet.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown that purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA approved the test at the first care-k-site for use at the end of that month in the United States on 21 March 2020. The clinical guidelines issued by the University of Wohan Zhanghan Hospital for the reporting of clinical facilities and the risks of generalization.
Bilateral multi-sided bulk-glass failures with a periodic, inaccessible and rear distribution in the initial infection are common.
When the disease grows, subplural domains, crying (through walls packed with variable aircoshial filling), and density may appear.
Covid-19's overwhelming injuries and diseases are less likely to be found.
The main medical examination resulted from the examination is:
Macroscopy: Shooth in Physphorus Eating, Pericarditis, Density of Feed and Physphorus
There are four types of severity of viruses:
Light Nimonia: Fufusy Shof, Neumositis Excessive, Large-African Neumositis, Lymphocytic Insurgents and Multicentric Inflammatory and Multicentric Cell Construction
Several Nimonia: Vicarna Air Cosy Resava (DAD) with Vicarna Air Cosy Resava (Vicarna Air Cosy Resava)
DAD is the cause of severe alpha-oxygenation (ARDS) and severe disorders.
Treatment of Nimonia: Management of recycling and fufusical interference in aircousies
Blood: Translated intra-inflammatory skandal (DIC); leukoarythroblastic action
Stay at home in preventative measures to reduce the probability of infection, avoiding crowd-breaking places, washing soap and water with hands for at least 20 seconds, keeping good breathing related hygiene and avoiding the eyes, nose or nose without touching hands.
CDC recommends shaping the mouse and nose with a towel and if the towel is not available, it recommends using the part inside the towel.
The right cleanliness of the hand is encouraged after the crash or crash.
CDC recommended the use of cloth-shaped face in public arrangements to restrict traffic by partially isolated individuals. The objective of contacting strategies with social distances is to enable contacts to stop schools and workplaces by targeting individuals, preventing and preventing travel.
The directions to make the distance also include people to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
No medication is known to be effective to prevent COVID-19. Since vaccine is not expected by at least 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the burning of the pandemic, which is called "reducing the cycle".
CDC also recommends that a person wash his hands with soap and water repeatedly for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands smell, before eating, dipping or shaking their nose.
In addition, it recommends using at least 60% alcohol-based hand sprayer, but only when soap and water are not easily available. Areas where commercial hand sprayer is not easily available, WHO provides two guidelines for local production.
In these substitutions, anti-suppressive action is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
The use of hydrogen peroxide is made to help eliminate bacterial seeds in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for the immune resistance".
The glycerol is mixed as a drug.
People are managed with auxiliary care, which may include providing fluid medical, oxygen assistance and other affected critical organs.
CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extraporial oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of breathing failure, but its benefits are still considerable.
Personal cleanliness and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve protection.
In the early stages of infection, helpful treatment can be useful in people with mild symptoms. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to take care of people who are in hospital with COVID-19.
In the U.S., entices and pulmonologists have compiled recommendations of treatment from various agencies in a free source, IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medications recommend paracytamol (sitaminophene) instead of ibuprophene for primary use.
Cautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in health care arrangements, when processes such as aeriosole intake or intake are carried out.
In addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air caution, CDC recommends that the person be held in an airborne infectious dispersion room (AIIR). Developing the equipment of the use of the CDC during public healthcare.
Recommended equipment is: PPE Chonga, respiratory or facial masks, visual safety equipment, and medical gloves. When available, respiratory devices (instead of facial masks) are given priority.
N95 breathing plants are approved for industrial arrangements, but the FDA has authorized mask for use under Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
They are designed for safety from airborne substances such as dust, but the effectiveness of a specific biological actor is not prerequisite for non-conformed experiments.
When the mask is not available, the CDC facial shelves or, as the ultimate measure, is recommended to use the mask made of the house.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so serious that they need mechanical speech or other options, but some percent of cases are required.
Type of respiratory aid for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for people who are disabled in the hospital, with some evidence that high flow can be Nazica entrance or two-level positive air pressure.
It is unknown whether any of these two provides a seriously sick people the same benefits.
Some doctors prefer to use intake mechanical speech when available because it limits the spread of aerosols compared to high-flow Nasica intake. Elderly adults (about 60 years of age and especially older than 80 years of age)
There are not enough hospital beds per person in many developed countries, which limits the ability of a health system to deal with the sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were charged in deep care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for interviews, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of the people who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were eventually transferred to ICU.
Mechanical sounds become more complicated because COVID-19 develops intense respiratory shock syndrome (ARDS) and it becomes difficult to provide oxygen to the north.
In order to maximize the distribution of oxygen by reducing the risk of damage to the fever associated with the ventilator, pressure control systems and capable ventilators in high PEEP are required.
High PEEP can not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments started in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdeciver seems to be the most desperate.
Although new drugs can be developed by 2021, but many of them are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
People with serious illness can try to get antiviral drugs.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the effectiveness of possible treatments and safety tests. FDA has provided temporarily health beneficial plasma as a experimental treatment in such cases where the life of a person is severe or immediate.
There are no clinical studies necessary to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to tackle this disease.
Users are invited to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risks of infection by detecting "near contact" using the monitoring data.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If possible risks are detected, the app recommends not only self-quartants, but also notes local health officials. The cell phone data, facial identification technology, contact technology and data from people who are used in contact, mobile phone tracking, and data based on large data for artificial intelligence.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track cell phone data from suspected people from the coronavirus.
This measure was taken to implement quarantine and to protect people coming into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Dr. Telecom shared a joint telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Coach Institute, to prevent the spread of the virus and to investigate it.
Russia has planned the facial identification technique to identify those who distort quarantine.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Galarra said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40 percent of people are voiced somehow."
The German government organized the 48-hour weekend of Hackethon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kalzulad called for a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience problems with quarantine, travel bans, side effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
According to Rory O'Connor, "a perfect storm that harms the mental health and effectiveness of people who have grown social disintegration, loneliness, health concerns, stress and an economically affected person."
Other common diseases of this disease can occur with or without a mild procedure with some symptoms encountering a common period of the disease of the upper respiratory pathway.
Mild cases usually cure within two weeks, while cases with severe or excessive diseases may take from three to six weeks to cure.
Based on estimates from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a high risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but have a reduced risk of estimates for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 fever can cause immunity by affecting the fever.
In the most seriously affected people, COVID-19 can develop rapidly in severe respiratory crash syndrome (ARDS), which can result in respiratory failure, sexual injury or multi-engine failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include liver, unusual skandal and harm to heart, bones and intestines.
Scandinavian abnormalities, particularly the increase in prothrombin time, have been reported to 6% of those who were in hospital with COVID-19, while 4% of this group are seen unusual harmful work.
Approximately 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in tissue enzymes (transaminases).
According to the report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, which spent five days in the hospital.
Nevertheless, the average time of hospitalization to patients transferred to ICU was between seven days and death.
In a study of initial cases, the average time of initial symptoms from demonstrating initial symptoms to death was 14 days, including a full range of six of 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), the rate of death in men was 2.8%, while the rate of death in women was 1.7%.
The tissue distortion tests of sweat-chemistry fever samples indicate a whirlpool air damage with cognitive fibromics in both sweat-chemistry fever.
There have been changes in cell deformation from viruses in neurocytes.
The image of the fever appeared similar to the severe breathing stroke syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by a high level of troponin or heart rate stop.
According to the estimates of March, 89% of the hospital residents had pre-hydraulic situations. The availability of medical resources and the social-economic situation of a region could also affect the death rate.
Estimates of death rate from the situation also vary due to those regional differences and system-related difficulties.
The rate of death may be higher due to the decreased calculation of light cases.
However, the fact that death is a result of previous cases may mean that the current death rate has been lowered.
In those who do not smoke, the likelihood of severe symptoms of COVID-19 was 1.4 times greater and the likelihood of deep care or death was roughly 2.4 times greater. The long-term rogotic symptoms of this disease are worried.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease in the capacity of fever in some people who are cured of the disease from 20% to 30%, and the fever scans expressed organ damage.
This can also cause profound after-care syndrome after healing.
Until March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous infectious disease provides effective and long-term protection in people who are treated with the disease.
Defence is considered potentially based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but positive tests for coronavirus have been reported on date after COVID-19 was corrected.
These cases are considered to be worse than an unhealthy infection than an infection.
The virus is considered to be a natural and natural origin that spread through human infections.
The actual origin is unknown, but the spread of the infection until December 2019 was almost completely carried out by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in January 2020, the first date of the beginning of symptoms was reported on December 1, 2019.
WHO's official publications announced the first of the symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to determine the death rate.
These numbers continue to change according to the area and time and are affected by the quantity of testing, quality of the health care system, treatment options, during the initial spray, and the characteristics of the population such as age, ling and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO determined emergency ICD-10 disease code for deaths by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory and the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory is also determined by the number of cases of a number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 calculated by the number07 of cases of the deaths for clinical or majorly diagnosed by the U-Death of COVID-19
Based on the estimates of the University of Jones Hopkins, by April 17, 2020 the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies according to the area. Other measures include the case death rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of individuals diagnosed with a disease, and the infected death rate (IFR) which has the percentage of infected individuals diagnosed with a disease.
These are not temporary and follow a specific population until the case is corrected from infection.
Although not all infected people are developing resistant, the presence of resistant can get information about how many people have been infected.
In the centre of Procope in Italy, Castiglione de Ada, in a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangalt, this disease was spread by carnival festivals and young people, which relatively reduced death rates, and all COVID-19 deaths could not be formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not a sharm.
In the Netherlands, according to blood toes, they can be resistant to approximately 3%.
The death of COVID-19 has been confirmed by 69 (0.004% of the population).
The impact of Maharashtra and its death rate vary for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have increased the rate of death in men.
The most risk for men is in their 50s, and the interval between men and women is less than 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate for men was 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent for women.
It is not known for the exact causes of this ling-intrinsic, but the genetic and behaviour factors may be a cause.
The differences related to ling-based resistance, less widespread smoking in women and the development of co-patient conditions in men such as women can contribute to high death rates in men in less age than women.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were males and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were males.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government is not looking at the lining-related views of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that virus diseases such as ibola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, women, are more likely to come into contact with their virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that this disease would be the official name "COVID-19".
WHO's chief tedros Adonoms Gabriels said CO meant coronavirus, VI meant virus, D meant disease, and 19 meant the year when the prokop was first identified on December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid a specific geographical location (such as China), to avoid references to species or groups of people, which are in line with international recommendations for the nomination for prevention of disobedience. The COVID-19 source of the virus (COV-19) is the source of the virus.
In addition, the WHO uses "COVID-19 viruses" and "COVID-19 viruses" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are generally referred to as "coronavires".
During the initial propulsion in China, viruses and diseases were generally referred to as "coronaviruses" and "coronaviruses".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as interim names for severe respiratory disease viruses and diseases, which comply with 2015 guidelines for not using places in disease and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limits in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of health materials such as Nazica fae and ventilators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an immediate ventilation, and the supplier was unable to provide the necessary time-limit, a local startup printed the necessary 100 valves overnight by reversing engineering.
Following the initial COVID-19 breakthrough, information on the origin, levels, prevention, treatment and other parties has grown and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus in some other animals.
The study failed to find the certificate of viral reproduction in pigs, bottles, and turkeys.
There is no medication or medicine for the treatment of the disease.
COVID-19 is conducted by international research organizations, educational groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Trial" to evaluate the effects of the four most hoped effectiveness of electrical antiviral compounds.
Currently there is no TIC available, but various agencies are actively developing TIC candidates.
The previous function on SARS-CoV is being used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 client to enter both human cells.
Three strategies are being examined.
First, the aim of researchers is to build a whole virus TC.
The purpose of the use of such viruses, whether deactivated or dead, is to generate a rapid response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
The goal of a second strategy, a subsidiary TC, is to create a TC that makes the security system sensitive to some sub-individuals of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is focused on S-contact protein that helps the virus to dissolve the ACE2 enzyme grease.
A third strategy is a new technique to create a nucleic amal TEC (DNA or RNA TEC, TEC).
The experimental teams of any strategy must be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a team with four volunteers in Seattle began.
A harmful genetic code copied from the disease-generating virus in TC is. Antibody dependent increase has been reported a potential challenge for TC development for SARS-COV-2, but it is contradictory.
More than 300 active clinical tests are being conducted until April 2020.
Seven tests were already evaluating approved treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
In order to be informed by the end of April, with nine phase III tests on remedeciver in many countries, most Chinese researches are re-working on target antiviral drugs.
Until April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 TC and drug candidates was underway. Several existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment are being assessed, including remedesicvir/chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
By March 2020, experimental certificates for the efficacy of the Remdeciver are available.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with non-conformed use of remedecivir.
Step III clinical tests are conducted in the United States, China and Italy. The initial results of chloroquine used for treatment of malaria were studied in China in February 2020.
Nevertheless, the research was invited to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend using chloroquine.
However, the Wohan Institute of Airology has noted, recommending a daily dose of a gram, that twice the dose is excessively dangerous and may be known.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the observation of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th version guidelines also include interferon or interferon for use for protection from COVID-19.
Initial estimates indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the texture of artificial environmental SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for further study in the organs after exhibiting lower concentration content of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that transmembrane protein serum 2 is essential to the initial intervention of SARS-2-protein-premiing for TMPRSS2, ACE.
The main limits of the studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without esomycin, which have not prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies have no COVID-19 treatment.
The increase in the amount of cytocain in the phases after severe COVID-19 may be a complication.
The evidence is that the amount of hydroxychloroquine can be characteristics that prevent the increase in citocaine. Toklizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines after a small study has been completed by the Chinese National Health Commission.
This has been undergoing non-randomized testing Step 2 at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritine blood tests to identify the increase in the amount of cytocain, it aims to face such an increase, which is considered the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, a different cause, CAR T cells were approved by the FDA on the basis of previous case studies for the treatment of steroid updated cytocaine production syndrome, inspired by CAR cells therapy.
Until now, there is no random, controlled evidence that tocelysismab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Moving clean and concentrated protectives produced by the COVID-19 protective system to those who need the investigation is being carried out as a non-teca method of deactivation.
This strategy was used for SARS with different results.
Viral recycling is the expected activity by which antibody therapy can arbitrate safely from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other activities, such as antibody-dependent molecular cytotoxicity and/or phenocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of antibody therapy, for example, the use of monoclonal resistors made, are in development.
Healthy beneficial serum, which contains a part of the blood fluid of correct patients and are specific resistance to this virus, can be increased for fast planning.
A group of coronavirus diseases, syndromes related to digestion
Lie Wenlianang, a medical professional at the central hospital in Wohan, infected with COVID-19 and died after increasing awareness of the spread of the virus.
