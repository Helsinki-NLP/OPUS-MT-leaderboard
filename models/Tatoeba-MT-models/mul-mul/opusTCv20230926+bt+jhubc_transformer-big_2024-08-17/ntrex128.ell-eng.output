Deputy members are worried that they will be confused with the "swords"
Some Members have expressed their concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose in relation to the plans of change in the name of the Parliamentary Assembly of Wales.
Members of the entire political sector are concerned that something like this would sound ridiculous.
A Member of the Working Party said his prolongation is worried that "it will equate the words of Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: The word "twp" means "small" and the word "pwp" means "small".
One of the Plate Members said the order was totally "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
A Conservative Hall said his own order was "open" about the change of name, but noted that the word MWP is not far away from the word "matter".
In this context, the word w is pronounced similar to the word u in English.
The parliamentary committee, which currently draws up the draft legislation on the adoption of the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which the Members will be called will naturally be the case of the Members themselves."
The U.S. Government Act of 2017 gave the U.S. Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on proposals, which were widely accepted for the appointment of the Parliament as Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the Members, the Commission has been in favour of the name "Member of the Parliament of Wales" or WMP, but the MWP election is the one that has achieved greater support during public consultations.
Deputy members are obviously proposing alternative choices, but the effort to reach a consensus can be a difficult case for Parliament's President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes in the functioning of the Parliament, including discount rules from the Member's office and the design of the committee system.
The Members will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name during the discussion of legislation.
People of Macedonia come to the covers for a referendum on the change of the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote of the people was requested in an attempt to resolve a decades of conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its northern neighbour's name covers territorial blasts and has repeatedly opposed its requests for joining the EU and NATO.
Giorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, warrior of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change is simply the price they must pay for their accession to the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's campaigns have crushed as the churches in Harlem disappear
“The elderly people I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” said Adams.
“Now there is nothing of both.”
He said he understands the reason the bars disappeared.
“The world is socializing in a different way today,” he said.
"The bar is no longer the 'salon' of the neighborhood where the world frequents regularly."
As for the churches, he is worried that the money from the sale of assets will not keep as long as the officials hope "and sooner or later will return to the point where they started".
The churches can be replaced by homes filled with people who will not be willing to help the place of worship that they have stayed in the neighborhood.
"The tremendous majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will hurry on the day all these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that all those people who will move to these apartments will become members of the public."
Both churches were built by white churches before becoming Harlem Black Metropolis - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Church of Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church located nearby took possession of the building.
The occupation of St. Martin's building was occupied by a black church under John Howard Johnson, who advanced in the bouquet of 125th Street stores, a basic commercial street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious disasters in the building, but Father Johnson's homeowners took up the rebuild and ordered the carriage.
Dear David Johnson, Father's son and successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the charity "the poor campaigns".
The professional who played the carriage in July characterized it somewhat differently: "cultural treasure" and "replacement of historical significance".
Tiffany Ian from the University of Michigan also noted that he was the first career in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lid, who became a major career in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriguader said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What is happening in St. Martin in recent months is a complex history between architects and workers, some of whom were hired by the people's leaders of the church, while others from the church.
The commissioners - the administrative body of the Anoryan, which is composed of popular leaders - sent to the spice in July a letter on their concerns that the spice "will seek to transfer the cost" to the body of the commissioners, despite the fact that this had no interference with the assumption of the principles.
Some immigrants complained about lack of transparency from the side of the spice.
A 13-year-old crash attack on assault for stacks in California
Karkariya was attacked and injured by a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during assaults in California, on the first day of the assault era, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m. near the Beach of Bicon Bites in the city of Enzitis.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV to San Diego that he had met his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the crying of the child asking for help and approached a team to get it out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just an excitement shouting because he caught a stack, but then he realized he shouted, "That pushed me!
Something forced me!"
The entire key had been opened,” Hammel noted when he arrived at the place where the boy was.
“I urged everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the sea!’” said Hammel.
The boy was air-to-air served at the Randy Games Hospital in San Diego and his situation is critical.
The type of rabbit responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Navigator Larry Jails told the press release that the rabbit had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but was deemed not belonging to any dangerous species.
Jails added that the victim brings serious injuries to the upper part of the cord.
The authorities prohibited access to the beach from Ponte Bise to Chasablade to Suamis to Ensinitis for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Jails noted that there are more than 135 species of cabbage in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans exert pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's are calculated with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, placing cosmetic sheets respectively with those of the complexes, managed with special staff.
As part of the significant growth of the UK cosmetic market, which is £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sales of clothing and household goods mark a decline, the largest cosmetic shelves will be put testing in 11 stores in the country, if more stores will be stored and spread across the country.
Investment in cosmetics comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the space in the sheets that once received televisions, microwave ovens and household species.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including companies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, more space will be given with the company's logo, similar to those stores such as Boots.
The supermarket again launches its own makeup series Boutique so that most products are vegan - something that the younger consumers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try to deliver its products to two Sainsbury's stores, one that opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the other in Shelly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The online markets and the market trend of small amounts of food every day in local mini-markets, means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Cooper, Sainsbury’s CEO, said that outlet shops will look more and more like the multi-shops as supermarket chains are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more off-food services.
Sainsbury's put outlet stores Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as imported some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported sales of stores and made purchases more profitable.
The previous effort of the supermarket to restore the cosmetics and pharmacies has resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a negotiation on how to distribute profits from pharmaceutical stores in the chain supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury’s sold the pharmacy company that was conducted with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, versus £125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play its own role in the project by adding a wide range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our raffles in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff that will be available to provide advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a powerful destination for cosmetics that doubts the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones: Holly Willowby's departure after the deal of £11 million
The protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is a great deal after teleplayer Holly Willoby left the £11 million deal with the lifestyle business she has to dedicate to the news of her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willobby has no time for the Truly clothing and accessories company.
Their business was similar to the Goop company of Guinness Patterous.
The 37-year-old show show "This Morning", announced on Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Whiloby made the Dragons Den series' protagonist Peter Jones, leaving their last-minute lifestyle business to dedicate to her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became an excitement when the golden girl of TV admitted during a meeting full of tensions on Tuesday at the central offices of his empire in Marlowe, in Baccalaurea, he had a short time to spend £1,5 years old, that because of the new contracts, he would not have a long time to spend more than £1,5 years old.
The company resembled the company Goop of Gwineth Patterous and appears to double the assets of Wiloby, estimated to be £11 million.
After the 37-year-old Viloby announced on Instagram that he was going to leave Truly, Jones fled out of Britain to some of his extraterrestrial homes.
According to a source, “Truly was far from Holly Wilobby’s top priorities.
It was the long-term future, the source of income for the next decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the central offices in Barcelona ready to be available for sale."
Experts estimate that the departure of the show's representative "This Morning", which belongs to one of the UK's most commercial celebrities, could cost millions to the company due to the enormous investment in products from jewelry and jewelry, jewelry and jewelry.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willobby, a mother of three children, and Dan Balduin's wife have maintained close friendly relationships with Jones and her husband Tara Cap for ten years.
Willobby founded Truly with the Cup in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones maintains a 40 percent share of the Baldwin television producer company.
Willobby will be the central face of M&S campaigns and replace Ad McPatlin with the show “I’m A Celebrity” on ITV.
A source from Jones’ close environment said last night, “We wouldn’t want to comment on his professional affairs.”
We were hard, and then we fell in love.
He was questioned about the criticism of the media for his comments that some would think it was not consistent with a president, as well as his so positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many submissions?
Trump said imitating the telespectator's style.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a big step towards North Korea's nuclearization.
Nevertheless, negotiations on denuclearization have been delayed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ray Yong-Ho told global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, North Korea's response to the United States' North Korea's North Korea "not seeing somewhere"
Instead, the U.S. continues to implement sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump maintained a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're going very well with North Korea," he said.
"We have to make a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now we have built this excellent relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have given positive fruit - the end of missile tests, the release of the homes and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
While he supported his unusual attitude in statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'presidential' style. But instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, showing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia scan a whole island, leaving thousands of dead in their past
In the storm of earthquake in Loboc, for example, it was announced that the assistance of foreign non-governmental organizations would not be needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Loboc was displaced, no national destruction was declared, a necessary condition for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they do not request international assistance, so it is quite difficult," Subung said.
While the Save the Children organization is preparing a team that will travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether the foreign staff will be able to work on-site.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the National Natural Disaster Service, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations would be allowed to contribute.
Given the seisms that often affect Indonesia, the country remains an unprepared victor to the wrath of nature.
While tsunami refugees have been built in Atche, the same does not happen in other coastlines.
The obvious lack of tsunami warning in Palu, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
In the best case, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are even more complicated by administrative care.
A sealed hospital that had been stationed in Loboc for the care of the victims of the earthquake goes to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Vindondo had focused on his campaign to improve Indonesia's disorganized infrastructure and invested a lot of money for the construction of roads and railroads.
However, the lack of funding swallows Mr. Joko's administration before the reelection next year.
Mr. Joko also accepts pressure from the remaining fanatic trends in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets using knives, turkeys, and turkeys, as well as other self-arms.
Watch: Daniel Steridz of Liverpool compares against Chelsea
Daniel Steridz rescued Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a 89-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steridz accepted all by Serdan Saquiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's end with his team to lose 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and jumped on his back.
His effort was driven very high from the large area and reached up right to the networks.
The ball finally fell over the Cape Arizabalaga that hit her to reject her and entered the network.
"I tried to take this position, to get to the ball and players like Shakira always play as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Stanley told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I made a direct change, I didn't think so much about it, and I did so much."
Chelsea had a 1-0 in half-year after the goal at the 25th minute from Belgian star Enten Azar.
The blue attacker gave everything with the shirt to Mateo Kovachits in this game, before giving a shot with a palm near the center of the floor and run on the side of Liverpool.
Kovachits did one and two in the middle of the floor.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar to the great area.
Azar ran ahead of the defender and completed by sending the ball to the nets to the back of the left-handed sweat in front of the Liverpool Alison Baker.
Liverpool will fight against Naples at the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the video at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
The tragic estimate of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The number of deaths after earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the country's natural disaster service statements early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the crashes of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that injured the area on Friday and created 6-metre waves in height, said the service spokesman, Peruo Nukrocho, in a press interview.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the rocks of the buildings that were destroyed.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect after killing a woman with a knife
A murder investigation began after the discovery of a woman's body in Burkenhead, Mursfield this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 p.m. injured by swords at Graceon Moose in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of murder.
The police asked the attendant who saw or heard something to put it to the police.
"The investigation is in the initial stage, but I would like to call anyone in the neighbouring area around John Street and see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly to taxi drivers, who may have written something on the planes from the dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have in possession of information that is vital to our inquiry.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Burkenhead and found in a building.
Today afternoon friends who think they might know the woman came to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations are evolving as the police said they are in the process of informing the closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Graceon Moose in his attempt to return to his apartment was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He wasn't talking when he found out what happened.
Openers have been informed that they may need to spend hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer said to a man that the entire area is currently treated as a crime place.
A woman appeared with tears at the scene.
He repeated "it's awful."
At 2 p.m. two of the police was located through the police cord and one outside.

Cromwell's Statue in Parliament becomes the last monument hit by friendship for the "writing of history"
His extortion would constitute poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of many cultural and religious works of England by his fanatic phoritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Club characterized Mr. Crik's proposal as "aids" and "aids to rewritten the story".
John Goldmith, President of the Cromwell Group, said: "In this debate on the removal of the statues, it was inevitable to not target the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Anctors.
The virtualization of the British civil wars was not banned or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong member of the Cromwell family sacrificed for the actions of Thomas’ ancestor in the previous century.
The exceptional reflection of Cromowell by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is characteristic of his image in the 19th century and part of the history of a personality that many believe is worth tax.
Mr. Goldmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromowell is still considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
The fact that this is an absolute precise case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that conflicts in the mid-17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized personality that represents one side of the split.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of respect and remarkable.”
Chicken killer injured Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in Southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose only name was "Waan", was found with a short artery in a bloody lake near a pig station in the Liuensui market in the province of Guizhou, South China, announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig officer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 in Zinging, China.
He had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring Yuan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and uncovered the door of a neighbouring pig.
He said that in the pigs there was a large-scale male pig with blood in his mouth.
The doctor's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 pounds had injured the farmer deadly, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were crushed and crushed," said the cousin, known as "W", according to Guyyang's dinner news report.
The security camera plans show that Ryan will enter the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Evan or to his cousin.
A market official said in the evening news report that the pig was placed in a cage to avoid attacking anyone else, while the police picked up evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wang's family and market authorities have to negotiate some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks on humans have also been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 295 pounds of pig threw a farmer in Wales on the tractor until the farmer's wife frightened the animal to be removed.
After the event in which a farmer from Oregon was scattered by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "inflammatory".
“They just have a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We just need to show them proper respect,” he said.
The remains of the Rose storm will bring extensive rainfall in the Southwest U.S.
According to forecasts, the Rose storm is exaggerating as it moves over the coldest water masses of the northern coasts of Mexico.
However, the Rosa storm will bring flooding rainfall in North Mexico and the Southwest U.S. over the next few days.
The power of the winds of the Rosa storm reached 85 mph, forming Category 1 storms at 5 p.m. east Sunday and was detected 385 miles southwest of Punda Euchenia in Mexico.
The Rose storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low wind pressure region has begun to form above the Pacific Ocean and move eastwards to the West Coast of the United States. As the flood of Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California west on Monday, a tropical storm will lead to the continent.
The Rosa storm will bring rainfall of 25 centimeters in Mexico regions on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture combined with the nearby low wind pressure region will create extensive strong rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, flooding flows and possibly downfalls in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates closer to 5 to 7.5 inches per hour locally, especially in parts of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
Heights of 5 to 10 centimeters are expected by locations in the southwest, especially in large part of Arizona.
Plains are possible with a rapid deterioration of phenomena due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended to avoid any movement by foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfall can turn the floods into rising rivers and storms will cause locally severe storms and floods.
The low wind pressure region will create some locally strong rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
A total height of rain above 1 cm is likely, which can cause small flows of crashes and elasticity in the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the moist period in the area.
Some disrupted tropical bars will begin to approach Arizona slowly on Sunday and the first hours of Monday morning before the phenomena extend slowly on Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rainfall will spread to the Fort Corners region on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, some severe temperature changes will be observed throughout the United States as the temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in tropical zones remain quite high.
Sometimes, this happens to lead to very intense temperature changes in nearby distances.
A characteristic example of intense temperature differences between the central U.S. was observed on Sunday.
There was almost 10-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moin in Ayova.
Over the next few days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In most of the Middle and Eastern U.S., October is expected to start at high temperatures at 27 °C from the Eastern areas to parts in the Southeast.
The temperature in New York may reach 27 °C on Tuesday, approximately 5 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term forecast for the weather, there are several chances of observation of temperatures above the average in the East U.S. until the first half of October.
More than 20 million television viewers were watched listening to Bret Kavano.
More than 20 million televisitors were attended by the submission of the candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, on Thursday, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political outbreak continued, with the television networks to interrupt the normal flow of the last-minute program on Friday: the deal by Secretary-General Arizona Jeff Flick to conduct a weekly investigation by the FBI in relation to the charges.
Ford told the Mayor's Justice Committee that he was 100 percent sure how on a party while he was high school students, Kavano was attacked while he was drunk and tried to pull out her clothes.
Kavano, in a loaded deposit, said it was 100% sure that something like that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen’s measurements, more than 20.4 million television viewers were likely watched on Friday.
The company estimated the average television networks of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately made available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen is usually difficult to calculate the number of television viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
To see this view in the right dimensions, it is a common analogy size with what is watching a side-of-foot match or the Oscar Awards award ceremonies.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported the appointment of Kavano, advanced with an average of 5.69 million television viewers during the day-to-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In the second place, the ABC is with 3.26 million television viewers.
CBS was followed by 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million, and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after hearing.
Felix became a protagonist in the drama of Friday.
After the Republicans’ moderate statement that they would vote in favour of Kavano, CNN and CBS cameras wrote on Friday morning demonstrators to try him as he was trying to enter the elevator to listen to the Mayor’s Justice Committee.
He was looking low for a few minutes as he was denied, live on TV at CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said a woman.
"Do you think he tells the truth to the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are weak."
Fleck said his office had made statements and, before the elevator's doors were closed, he would have to say more in the Commission hearing.
All cable television and broadcasting networks were covered live a few hours later, by the vote of the Mayor's Justice Committee on the promotion of the Cavanate's candidature to vote in the Mayor's plenary.
However, Felix said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the claims against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Felix was partly convinced after discussions with his friend, Secretary of the Democratic Party, Chris Kouns.
After discussions with Khuns and some other generals, Felix was dismissed.
The election of Flick was in effect because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather the votes for the approval of Kavano without conducting an investigation.
President Trump asked the FBI to conduct an investigation into claims against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of EU departure plans of "playing political games" with the future of Britain and undermine national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her in the press, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized the Brexit Checkers plan, saying that the proposal to withdraw tariffs between the UK and the EU was "very irrelevant".
Wade Sims Shooting: Police arrested suspect Dateon Simson for the murder of a player in LSU
Police arrested a suspect of the killing of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
David Smithson, 20-year-old, was arrested and incarcerated for second-degree murder, according to Baton Rose's police department.
The authorities have a video in their hands from the complexion of Sims with Simson and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the chock.
Police detected the glasses at the crime scene and said they detected traces of Simson's DNA, according to the WAFB cooperating with CBS.
After Simson's interrogation, the police said he admitted that he had injured Wade deadly.
His warranty was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of East Baton Rose's physician who circulated on Friday, the cause of death is a ball injury in the head and neck.
The Ministry put a special working group at the Louisiana Police Department, the police crime laboratory, the Southern University Police Forces and the region’s citizens to assist in the investigation into arrest.
LSU sports director Joey Alleva welcomed local law enforcement authorities for "accredited research and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 metres tall forward grew up with Bathon Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ribauts per match last season.
Friday morning, LSU Basketball Coach Will Wade said the team was "disturbed" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
“We’re always worried about such events,” said Wade.
Emissions of flood grave in Mexico City
The floods of the floods of Popocatepetel came to the southern neighbourhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico's residents to stay away from the ephastic area on Sunday, after the holding activity reached its disclosure, recording 183 emissions of gas and depression within 24 hours.
The Center was watching various signs and small earthquakes.
Images on social media show cars covered with thin layers of tea in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Sochimilko.
The geophysicians observed an increase in the activity of the hephasitus located 45 miles (72 miles) southeast of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 rifles in central Mexico in September 2017.
The hephastic, known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Police forces fight with Catalan autonomists in terms of the anniversary of voting for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a conflict of protesters in favour of independence with the order restoration units, as thousands participated in the demonstrations for the first anniversary since the vote on the departure of Catalonia caused by polls.
A group of mask demonstrators in favour of independence, which were held by the restoration units of the class, threw eggs and bowls into dust, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets usually flooded by tourists.
Complications were also observed later during the day with the police to use their clubs to overcome the complications.
For hours, groups of supporters of Catalonia’s independence shouted the slogan “We don’t forgive, we don’t forget” against groups of demonstrators in favour of the country’s unity called “Live Spain”.
Fourteen people were hospitalized with microinjuries occurred during the demonstrations, according to the local type.
The tensions remain high in the region that supports independence a year after the referendum on October 1 was declared illegal by Madrid, which, however, is celebrated by the autonomous Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters elected independence, although accession was low with those who oppose independence to vote on the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, approximately 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police attempted to stop voting at the electoral centers in the area where violent complications took place.
Groups for independence camped on Friday evening to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration was carried out and another was forced to make a different committee.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who participated in demonstrations for independence with his wife, said there was no longer hope for Catalonia's prospects to gain its independence.
“We lived one of our brightest moments last year.
I saw my parents with tears of joy who were able to vote, but now the situation is standing,” he said.
Despite the fact that they noted a victorious victory of vital importance, although limited in regional elections last December, the Catalan parties for independence struggled to retain their dynamics this year's ruling, with many of their most well-known leaders resigning to be self-electioned or being subjected to.
John Putin, a 42-year-old engineer, who wrote his mobile protests for police, said the conflicts were powered by politicians of both camps.
"The intensity is increasingly climbing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were protected last year, announced his candidate for the Euro elections for the next year.
"My candidate for the European elections is the best way to accuse the oppression of democratic values and the oppression we have accepted by the Spanish Government," he said.

Menga's hit gave Livingston 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Mega's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The overwhelmed Livingston won the Rangers by awarding Stephen Gerard just his second defeat in 18 games as the manager of the Emprox group.
Dolly Mega's hit made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernians in second place.
Gerard's team remains unwinnable at the championship this season and faces the Harts, who have eight-degree progress on Sunday.
Before this match, the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston continues her race in six games in her category, with major coach Holt not yet having been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead a long time before it scored, with its imminentness to bring their Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took forward and decided to arrive just before the end, but Alan Lithgow rejected his effort by screwing Craig Halkett's head away from the end.
The landlords were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could bring visitors to free hits and corners.
This is how the important goal came.
The Rangers were unable to prevent a free hit, and Livingston made the opening, Deklane Galhacher and Robinson cooperated to send the ball to Mega, who took the whole and screamed from the center of the area.
Until that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball's possession but found incomparable the defense of the landlords and the terminal guard Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This shape continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos pulled off the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was deleted by the legs of the Rangers's Alan McGreger, and the entire Litgous came out in a further free strike in Livingston.
There were many verticals everywhere in the Livingstone area, and they were constantly replying, while two penalties were requested - after the ball was filed by Halkett against substitute player Glen Middleton and one hand-to-hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" from Livingston - analysis
Alaster Lamoud from the BBC of Scotland on the Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
Viewable performance and results for Livingston.
All of them were exceptional, exceeding the expectations in this outstanding course.
The game style and their personality changed at least after returning to the top form, but the aesthetics should also be given to Holt for the stimulation he gave the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chef Halkett was excellent, turning a highly organized defense, while Mega kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warrel in guards throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the contrary, had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they did not respond to these standards.
Their last game was short - only once they managed to pass the defense of the landlords and this is a warning campaign for the Rangers, which are in the middle of the ranking.
Immortal emotions in the receipt of Erdogan in the Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29) at the meeting of state leaders of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had come to an end in issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to launch a new giant jazz.
The city hosts the largest community of Turkey outside of Turkey.
Police disabled for security reasons the crowd’s concentration of 25,000 people in front of the jazz, but many supporters managed to approach to see their president closely.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurdish - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The dissemination of protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Wheelchair accident in Detroit: cyclist death after a collision with a car
A bicycler lost his life in a conflict with a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossroads of the Westwood Street roads and Evelyn Street, a multi-climbing street in Detroit, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the rescuers of the ambulance tried to help, but the man lost his life on the ground.
The conflict took place a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a bicycler, who lost his life on the Childer Street street, about 1.6 miles away from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities were making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have been closed and the bus routes have been shut down, while the drivers have received instructions to avoid the area.
Long Larthin's wings: Six police officers injured in complications
Six police officers were injured in disturbances in high-security prisons, according to the Department of Prison.
Tarahs flew in prisons of this Majesty Long Lardin in Warstershire at about 9:30 p.m. on Sunday and are still in evolving.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been forced to deal with the disturbances, involving eight prisoners and manifested in one wings.
Police were hospitalized with microinjuries in the face during the complications.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained personnel were required to deal with the incident in prisons of this Majesty Long Lardin.
Six members of the staff were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we clarify that those who are responsible will be sent to police authorities and may impose greater punishment.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in prisons of this Majesty, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, the Department of Prison was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, the order recovery units were invited to imprisonment to deal with serious incidents, during which staff members were attacked with billiard balls.
The storm of Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (areas with dryness may benefit)
It is rarely a tropical recession to injure Arizona, but this is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week, as the remains of the Rose storm will cross the southwest parts of the desert, bringing floods to their passage.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued exceptional warning reports for floods on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to south and eastern Nevada, Southeast California, Southeast California and Yuta, including floods.
Rose's storm is expected to pass over Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix noted in its tweet that “only ten tropical circles have remained in a tropical storm or low barometry at less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the U.S. National Tubo Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rainfalls of up to 6 inches in the Moscow Rim of Arizona.
In other Southwest states, including the Central Mountains and Grey Bashin, there is a probability of rainfall of 1 to 2 inches, with the probability of individual total rainfalls up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not threatened by floods, the rain brought by Rosa can be a blessing, as the area is affected by dryness.
Although floods are a very serious issue, part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as Southwest states are currently under dry conditions.
According to the U.S. Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona face at least extreme dryness, which is the second highest category of dryness,” weather.com said.
First, the Rosa storm will arrive at the staircase of Baha California Peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the storm, Rosa will be 385 miles south of Mexico’s Pound Eugene with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour and move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
Hence, it is expected to arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm intensity on Monday afternoon or evening.
There may be a severe rainfall in regions of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of floods.
"A total rate of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is estimated from Bahia California to Northwest Sunora, which may reach up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rose will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and arrive at the border of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometry, which will then pass through Arizona to arrive in the south of the night.
"The main risk expected by the Rosa storm or its remains is the very intense rainfall in Bahrain California, the Northwest Sunora and the Southwest states of the U.S.," said the U.S. National Terrorism Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous intense floods and winter floods in the deserts and floods in the mountainous territories.
Attack to Minchomer Norton: Four arrests for suicide attempts
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspected murder attempt after detection of a 16-year-old who brought a knife injury to Somerset.
The boy was injured in the Excelsior Teresa of Mintchomer Norton area, about at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
She moved to the hospital, where she remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Randstock area, police said.
Police are calling for anybody who may have recorded in a video on his mobile phone what happened.
Trump stated that Kavano "has lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavano is a vote of rejecting the unpleasant and excitemental tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a concentration in West Virginia's Wilingham.
Trump stated that Kavano "has lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of showing him as a candidate.
Kavano added to Congress on Thursday, rejecting categories and with apparent excitement of Christian Blaise Ford's allegations that she was sexually attacked decades ago, when she was teenagers.
Ford also filed a hearing hearing for its claims.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Kavano that day.
"The vote to confirm the candidateship of Judge Cavanate is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a legal with excellent public service course," he said in a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavano's nomination, while talking about the importance of the Republicans to participate in the interim elections.
“We have five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but it’s actually like I’m,” he said.
"For this reason I travel everywhere, supporting excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and prevention".
The first major procedural vote in the General for Cavanato's nomination is expected to take place later on Friday, CNN said as a senior assistant officer of the Republican Party's leadership.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were withdrawn from the giant waves that scattered the coasts, when large earthquakes and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi of Indonesia, officials said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday, when waves of six meters high attacked the sulphur in the firm, killing many to death and destroying everything in their passing.
The tsunami occurred after the earthquake of 7.5 Richter.
"When the threat to tsunami yesterday appeared, the world was still on the beach and did not run immediately, so it was hit by it," said Sutopo Purgo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian BNPB disaster treatment service, in an update.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, threw cars, wood, houses, hit everything in the fort," Nogroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hit the coast.
Some people threw on the trees to get out of tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the catastrophe treatment service show many damaged buildings and stores, bridges that have been demolished and collapsed, and a bridge surrounded by water.
Changes continued to injure the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb falling into Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The city's geography, which is located at the end of a narrow bay, could increase the size of tsunami, he said.
Nogroho described the damage as "extended" and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
He said the victims were trapped under the cravings of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were ignored.
Nogroho said the victims and damages could be bigger along the coastline of 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Dongala, which is closest to the center of the earthquake.
The communications systems "have completely dissolved and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are directed to the areas they occupy.
"It's already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
Eureia criticized the Office on Saturday because he did not inform that tsunami had injured the Palu, although, according to officials, the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video announced on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building sounds like screaming panicking trying to warn people down the road for the tsunami coming.
Within a few minutes, a water wall climbs on the coast, shaking houses and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large interruption of electricity, which also interrupted communications in the wider region of Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army began sending carriage aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but displaced people still need desperate food and other basic types of first-class emergency.
The city’s airport opened again only to help help and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Windodo’s visit to the exile centers in Palu on Sunday has been scheduled.
The victims of tsunami in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to arrive safely in Palu, where workers found refuge in accommodations from mosaics standing in their office, they passed from disaster scenes on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many damaged houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some aid groups took the sad duty to start the relief process, some complain that they did not intervene in foreign, especially experienced workers in the field of assistance to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only begin if the place of an injury is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a destruction at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says it is a national destruction, we can address an international assistance request, but there is no decision yet.”
As the second day spent in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family who are still ignored still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less painful.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled off by an unlawful.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under a trap for two days, next to her mother’s dead body.
Goodton Sumbadon, coach of the Indonesian national alexpecting band, had trained two of the ignored alexpecting players for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were arrested at the hotel Rhoda Rhoda, including Mr. Maddie, were his students.
"As an older man in the sport of the non-fake, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Ginton told us how, when the news about the collapse of Hotel Roa Roa in the community of the misleading counterfeiting, he began to send deceased WhatsApp messages to his opponents in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, the marking next to his messages was a grey symbol "n", instead of two blue.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Cliffs cut $26,750 while delivering an automatic pick-up machine in Newport and Levy.
Friday morning, thieves cut $26,750 off from Brink's employee who was delivering an ATM machine to Newport, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had dropped an ATM machine in the entertainment group and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Denis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man came running behind Brink’s staff and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the point, according to the statement, but the police did not identify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact Newport police, calling 859-292-3680.
Cannie West: Raper changes his name to Ye
Raper Cannie West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The one that is officially known as Kane West.”
West, a 41-year-old, has been listening to the headquarters for a long time and has used this headquarters as a title in his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came from his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
He replaced the show’s singer Ariana Grante, who canceled her appearance for “emotional reasons”, as the show’s creator said.
In addition to being a briefing of the professional name he uses today, West had stated in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that the word yes is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you," said West earlier this year in a discussion on the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm you, I'm you.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the only", to Son, which is simply a reflection of the good, evil, of the confused ourselves, of all.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known for various names, such as Paff Daddy, P. Diddy or Deddy, but this year he announced that he prefers names Lab and Brader Lab.
A former partner of West, Zhej-Zhi, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without letters and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico swears he will not use the army against citizens
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Ombrodor swore he would never use military violence against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody oppression of students.
Lopez Obador promised on Saturday at Plateau Talladelko Plaza that he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.
On 2 October 1968, troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people, in a period when the left student movements acquired roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obradour has committed to supporting new Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are increasing young people towards criminal boundaries.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China operates more actively in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence, Kay Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Apple and Microsoft.
This comment comes to be added to advertisements from various parts of the U.S. government on artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence in general.
In the meantime, China presented last year its plan to become the world’s first country in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries remain so much in the United States and we are striving to make the next significant discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of the budget could double the chances of taking place in the U.S. for the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Wally and the New World Class of Things) has a company headed by China+Government to China, whose leader in a+Government is this month Silent Ventures Directed by Houghton Miffcourt.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an artificial intelligence system that won the best American Othello player, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google annex in China.
Lee recognized the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Plans Service (DARPA), and asked when the next will take place to identify the next spectators.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to receive state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the best of the academic space, it’s the companies,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired authenticities from universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Li said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to support her efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green card should be offered automatically to doctoral degree holders in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China adopted a Plan for Artificial Intelligence Development next year in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government agencies, respectively, share money in American researchers, but the quality of the academic project is the lowest in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded a Joint Center for Artistic Intelligence, in which partners from the business and academic world will be joined, and the White House announced the formation of an Ambassador to the Artist Commission.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Institute of Science is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no progress in U.S. legislation for months with the aim of establishing a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian citizens are taking a referendum to decide whether they will change the country's name
The people of Macedonia participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be transferred to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would cause a decades of disagreement with Greece that had blocked the country's candidate for membership in the European Union and the UN.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a prosecution on its territories and has exercised a veto on its input to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the participation would reach the required 50 percent to be valid.
The question on the vote was, "You are in favour of NATO and the EU membership with the approval of the agreement with Greece."
Submitters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged from its adoption.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, to allow the youth of Macedonia to live freely under the European Union's army, because so our lives will be safer," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Scopy.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of the parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote in order to become definitive.
A majority of two-thirds in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Committee said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the participation reached only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so 66 percent of the registered voters gave it.
"I came to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said 62-year-old Josh Tanevsky, a voter in the capital of Scotland.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaev, Zorica's wife and Dusko's son voted in a referendum on the change of the country's name that would open the way for the country's joining in NATO in September 2018 and the European Union in the city of Sterumika.
In front of the parliament in Scotland, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small stage and places chairs in front of stages that have been held by those who will vote for the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not as a second-class partner," he said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can refer to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the European Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring multi-political investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the tremendous majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zeef said in a statement.
He said a positive result would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, i.e. lower than the required participation.
According to another survey conducted by the Telma TV station in Macedonia, 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote positively.
In order to succeed the referendum, the participation must reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious strike in the policy of the Western government, from its outpouring in power last May.
Watch: The Sergio Aurora of Manchester City spends the whole defense of Brayton to put a goal
Sergio Aurora and Rahim Sterling made Brayton's defence by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Edith Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aurora showed that it was easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received everything in the middle of the floor at the beginning of the stage.
He passed three Brieton's defenses before he dropped into the open space.
Aurora was then found surrounded by four green players.
He drove a defence, then fled from several others to the end of the Great Breitton area.
Then he gave everything to his left, finding Sterling.
The English Forward made his first movement in the area by returning the ball to Aurora, who used his right foot to defeat the Matthew Ryan’s terminal guard, scoreing on the right side of the network.
"Aguaro faces some problems in his legs," Citi's coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We had to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have hit a goal at that time.”
However, Sterling was the one who gave the blues the original advantage in the battle of Premier League.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aurora got the ball deep in the Brayton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Liroy Sane.
Sane held the ball in possession and led Sterling to the back of the docker.
The blue foreword threw the ball into the nets just before he went out.
City faces Hofenheim at the Champions League teams on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Riin-Neckar Arena stadium in Sisim, Germany.
Sergey wants to defeat rocks
As the Niasonals were excluded from the sides, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But always competitive Sergey is hoped to play Sunday against Colorado Rockys, but only if there are still effects on the Rockys on the side as they go on a Los Angeles Dogers game in the National League West.
The Rockys have passed their 5-2 victory against the Nazis on Friday night, but they still want to lock their first position in their category.
"While we don't have anything to win, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game of the most likely level we're going to face this year.
Why don’t I want to compete in such a race?”
The Nazis have not yet announced who the original killer will be on Sunday, but they are allegedly tend to let Serser throw the ball.
Sergey Sergey, who is going to make his 34th launch, has made training shots on Thursday and will play Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.
Washington’s right hand has a performance of 18-7 with an average profitable score (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 outs due to stray in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
The President directly referred to the situation regarding his elected candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, in his speech on the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the interim elections.
“Everything we have done is in November.
We take five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
It's a very important moment. I'm not a candidate, but in fact it's like I'm, and for this reason I'm travelling everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this narrow, narrow radical group of Democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power using any necessary means. You see evil, thirst.
They don’t care who they are injuring, who they have to destroy to get power and control, because what they want is power and control and we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have taken a mission of "resistance and obstacle".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, characterizing Democrats as "infuriated and evil, unfaithful and liars."
He was referred to the Court of Justice of the General General by making nominations to the Secretary-General of the Democrats Diane Finstein, a report that was accepted with possible depreciations by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you discover the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, I'm expecting a response. It was a really bad use of the body language, the worst use of the body language I've ever seen."
The Working Party is no longer a broad arrangement.
It is not tolerable for those who express their opinion.
I wasn't surprised at all that activists of the Mondetum Movement in my local group voted for me to be a muffle.
In addition, I am the last of a series of Labour Party Members who said they are not welcome, just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague John Ryan had similar treatment because he was decisively opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motto proposal was criticized because I agreed with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, traditionally, for issues similar to those that Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Workers' meeting of Northern East on Friday said that "we welcome our meetings to be productive with the participation of all".
In most of the eighteen years I am a local Member of the Workers, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday evening were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the ton of many meetings and the promise for a "more versatile, more compassionate" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever really begun to be implemented.
It is increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated by the Worker Party and that every opinion is judged based on whether it is acceptable by the leadership of the Party.
This began a little after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues I thought we had similar political views earlier began to wait for me to turn 180 degrees and adopt opinions from the EU that I would never agree with, whether they were concerned with national security.
Every time I talked publicly, regardless of what I really said, I heard a disturbance on social media, where some were asking for my resignation, they declared the policy of the center and said that I should not be a member of the Working Party.
And that didn't happen only to me.
Actually, I know that I am happier than other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually politically.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a shark of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never leave.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how attacks are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer constitute a wide range and that with any proposal of muffle or change of the rules of choice, the boundaries of the party are tired.
I have been advised many of the past two years not to rise up, not to talk too much and that so "it'll be all right."
But I didn't go into politics to do this.
Since I joined the Working Party 32 years ago, as a student still, because of the resignation shown by the Government of Thasser which literally led to the failure of my entire class, my purpose was to protect better public services of the government as a minister for those who need them more, or as a local member.
I have never hid my policy and I did the same in the last elections.
Nobody in the Southern East could have been confused in any way with regard to my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who have promoted the Mumbai proposal on Friday, the only thing I have to say is that while the country is facing a Brexit that will injure our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy for if I am faithful to the Labour Party leader.
But, in fact, my only message is not directed to the members of the Momentum Movement in Northern Ireland, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that a threat of rejecting or political visibility will not prevent you from doing so.

AIR - MELROUSZ: 38 - 17: The invincible AIR ascends to the top
Two delayed goals may have slightly turned the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserves to triomphe in this extremely fun today’s Tened Championship match.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only unfair group of ten.
Finally, it was her highest defense, as well as the best exploitation of opportunities, which made the weight for the landlords, and coach Peter Murchi had any reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still uncertain, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Merrough said: "Congratulations to Air, opportunities have been exploited better than we are."
Grant Anderson's goal at the 14th minute, with the conversion of Fraser Climate, brought Air ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish Rory Huggs, who was awarded to the game by the Wallorers.
Climate increased Air's predecessor with penalty, before it scored just a half-year-old goal, leading Air to the 17-5-year-old wardrobes.
But Melrose started the second half-year well, and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Baghcott's conversion, reduced the progress to five degrees.
There was a long wait due to a severe injury by Ruared Noth, which was removed by carriage, and, after restart, Air raised another difference with a goal of Stafford McDowell, with climate change.
Deputy Chief Blair McFerson then took a yellow card and Merrouse reused the numerical advantage with Bruce Colvin's goal without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The landlords returned, however, and when Straun Hachinson took a yellow card for a climbing in the Climate without the ball, from the line of the Penalti, McCarterson noted a goal at the back of the attack that Ir exploded.
Climate made a conversion, as it did almost once again from restart, after Kylie Rowe first collected David Armstrong's shirts and sent the extreme Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the landscapes.
Still Game champion starts a new career in focus
Still Game Ford Kernan is ready to move into the focus industry after it was revealed to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, which he writes, and in which he collaborates with his long-standing partner in comedy Greg Hubble.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle will be the last of its broadcast, and it appears that Kernan is planning his life after Ganglade.
According to the official registers, it is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source stated that Kernan wants to deal with the "aquatic focus industry" in Glasgow.
"The Sea is ours": The rounded Bolivia hopes the court will open again the path to the Pacific
Navals travel to the fully equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are blue flags.
On the bases of the navy from Lake Titicaka to the Amazon is written: “Our sea belongs legally.
It is our duty to get her back."
Throughout a solid Bolivia, the remembrance of the coastline that Chile received after a bloody conflict for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as well as the recipient of its people to travel to the island.
These hopes have been renewed today more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the dynamic, a spirit of unity and calmness, and of course expects the result with a positive view," said Roberto Calzandilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the issue of the International Court’s decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide for the arbitration of Bolivia to oblige Chile to, after decades of unemployed talks, to negotiate.
Eve Morales, the charismatic autonomous President of Bolivia, who gives a controversial battle for his reelection next year, has much to win or lose from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that, even if it did, they would not change much.
The United Nations organization in the Netherlands has no power to give thousands of lands and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court will be issued only six months after the presentation of the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarat, Chilean expert in international law matters.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia’s goals, the last four years may have undermined them.
"The current government of Bolivia has been harassed with the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales’s aggressive rhetoric has exacerbated every remaining good mood in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss afterwards.
Both countries haven’t exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Edward Rodriguez Belge, a spokesman of Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision procedure was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will gain "a great opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "find up 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," she said.
Kazakhstan also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular leaders of Latin America, uses the issue of sea exit as a political dean.
"Bolivya will never be denied its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Rei Yong Ho said his state would never unarmed his nuclear weapons first if he couldn’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises they made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of both states.
Ri made these comments while U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to restart the nuclear diplomacy he had reached at the end three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The view that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S. refusal to announce the end of the Korean War will sometimes force the Northers to "glorify" is a dream of summer night.
Washington will agree to issue the relevant declaration if Pyongyang does not first make significant disarmament movements.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is seriously thinking of declaring a weapon that the country possibly considers the only means that guarantees its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows reveal the latest trends in over-sized hats that will soon be available in a shop near you
If you want to grow the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop searching.
The designers of Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of over-sized chapels for their collection of Spring-Summer 2019 that stole the show at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely uncomfortable hats covered Instagram this summer and the designers sent their impressive creations to the puzzle.
The piece that was forgotten from Valentine's was an overwhelming bees hat decorated with a flat boar with wings that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other over-size accessories were presented crops decorated with stones, a chapel of magic, even an ananas, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks over time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sharpened lips and appeared more to Hannibal Lekter than in high-rap fashion.
One creation brought in the mind full equipment of intrusion with breathing and glasses, while another looked like a frozen ice cream in a hook.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you are lucky.
Styleists predict that these huge chapels could reach central shopping streets near you.
The over-sized hats made their appearance very quickly after the La Bomba, the sharp hat with the very wide boar we’ve seen wearing so many, from Riana to Emily Rataikosky.
The popular sheet that created the extremely uncomfortable chapel that covered the social media has sent another great creation to the palace, a sharp beach bag almost as large as the model that wears her by wearing her bath.
The dark orange sheets bag, decorated with cross sheets and a white leather handle, was the piece that was forgotten from the 2019 Jacquemus Spring-Summer collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Luc Armitz said in the FEMAIL column: "I hope to see large hats and large beach bags in the shops next summer, as the designer made such a great sense that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for overcome."
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with another series of excellent results in exams, which were simply further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of services to students and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher educational degrees, the professional career they will also choose their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school study programme by order, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable selection course at schools.
Nelson Madelee said, “If you speak to someone in a language that you understand, then what you say gets into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s examinations, we find that languages are at the top of the performance boards, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages succeeded in a degree of liberation A.
Statistics collected by 74 SCIS school members showed that 72 percent of the students succeeded in graduation A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the German students, 69 percent of the German students also had Spanish and 63 percent of the French students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Today's languages, as a selection course, are considered as important as courses related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and elsewhere.
The UK Employment and Skills Committee’s 2014 survey revealed that, as regards the reasons why employers were difficult to cover empty jobs, the 17 percent class was related to a lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, the need for linguistic skills is becoming increasingly compulsory so that young people are prepared for their future professional career.
Since more future employment opportunities require linguistic knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you will choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, due to this skill that you will be able to use throughout your life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then this multilingual person will automatically have an advantage against competition.
According to YouGov’s survey in more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to make a conversation, while French was the only candidate percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investment in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of the developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find employment with meaning.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose from independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this field.
Scotland’s independent schools devotely provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever and if they preserve the future.
It cannot be denied today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
Actually, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturality and excellence for Scottish youths.
They have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland.
Lebrone will make his debut to Lakeers on Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting for fans to see Lembron make his first appearance with Los Angeles Lakers has almost reached her end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first game before the race period against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
However, it has not been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers’ reporter Mike Trundel wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the training a few days ago, James asked about his plans regarding the six games that Lakers had to give before the race period.
"I don't need preparation games at this stage of my career to prepare me," he said.
The concentration of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of concentrations starting with West Virginia's Wiling.
This is the first of five planned concentrations of Trump next week, including surroundings in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his election to the Supreme Court in wait, Trump seeks to strengthen the popular support for the upcoming intermediate elections, as Republicans are at risk to lose Congress control by the vote.
What time is Trump's concentration in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump concentration in Wiling West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's concentration in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be mentioned in hearings this week for the Supreme Court candidate, Bret Kavano, who had been in an atmosphere due to allegations of sexual crimes, while he was in an FBI week with a confirmation vote in the Senate.
However, the main goal of this series of concentrations is to help the Republicans face a doubtful outcome in the November elections in order to gain some dynamics.
Thus, President Trump's campaign chief said these five concentrations aim to "mobilize volunteers and supporters next week, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of those in the General Assembly and the House of Commons."
“Congressional control is as critical for his agenda, that the president travels as many states as possible as we are traveling to the busy period of the campaign,” said Trump’s spokesman Reuters, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The tonight-planned gathering at the Wesbanco Arena of Wiling could bring supporters from "Ocean and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pichburg media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won with a difference of more than 40 percentage units in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia, who is low in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him an incentive to the covers," said Simon Hunter, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the chance to fight keeping hopes alive as it leads to Sunday’s singles
After three single-sided games, Saturday's quarters might even be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talented outbreak of the cord is a completely inspired sporting idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such an outbreak.
Where would they say that the cord is now?
"Six degrees were advanced and now it's four, so we're probably having a small row," said Jordan Spitch as he left for the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage of moving forward with four degrees and remaining twelve still in the game.
The Americans, as Spyth says, feel the "air in their foreheads" and have a lot to encourage them, such as the twin Spyth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each broke three degrees from the four.
Spitch was deadly from tee to green and gives an example.
The voices of the warnings became stronger as he continued his round, managing a critical hit to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The strike with which they won the game in the 15th was accompanied by similar remarks showing his belief that the American team is not out.
"You have to look deep inside and worry about your own game," Spit said.
That’s what each player has left.
18 holes to write a story.
The only players with more degrees than SPITH and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flytwood, the undeniable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but admirable twin in Europe has achieved four in four and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only twin who didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way the energy appears to flow to and from the noise viewers, emphasizes the fact that they are the players you should win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flittwood or Molinari to seal a potential European victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
Baba Watson and Web Sibson put the glasses in Sergio Garcia, the hero of the breakfast fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles in front nine, they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole that they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting matches to watch them closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has had a significant progress on the last day, but this foursome match has also shown that the U.S. team has the fights, despite some doubts.
Europe gets 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its fourball and foursome Saturday with 10-6 versus the United States.
The inspired twins of Tommy Flittwood and Francesco Molinari made two wins in a fighting Tiger Woods and managed to get the lead at Le Golf National at four degrees so far.
Thomas Biorn's European side, trying to maintain the lost trophy at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. resisted more foursome, winning two matches, but couldn't cover the difference.
Jim Furrick’s side needs eight degrees of the 12 single matches on Sunday to maintain the troop.
Flitwood is the first European newlywed player to win four degrees in series, while along with Molinary, also known as "Moliwood", after a shocking weekends in the first round of the Ryss is just the second twin to win four degrees in series.
Having stripped Woods and Patrick Rid in the fourballs, they unite their forces to deceive a tired Woods and American newly emerged Brison DeSampo with an even more brilliant 5&4.
Woods, who was defeated in the two Saturday matches, showed occasional explosions of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourball, returned to Henry Stanson's companion for the foursome with 2&1 defeat of Justin Johnson and Brooks Capca, conquering the first and third place in the world ranking.
They did not all go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cold day in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spitch and Justin Thomas put the sound for the Americans with two degrees on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 victory over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned to defeat the 4&3 Poulter and Rory McCallray in foursomes while they lost both holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team was able to recover while losing four degrees in singles, although because he is the trophy, Furrick is enough to achieve a balance to maintain the trophy.
However, after being found in the second place for two days, it appears that an attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not be disarmad unilaterally without confidence measures
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen the feeling of uncertainty against the United States and that his country will not only leave its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, e.g. the interruption of nuclear and ballistic tests, the decommission of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons testing installations
“We don’t see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to start our disarmament unilaterally.”
While R. R. reiterated known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a "stadial" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea's denuclearization would not be awarded as the denuclearization would not be awarded, as it gradually progressed in the process, its statement was significant.
Ri reported in the public announcement by Kim Yong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when he promised security security on the 12th of June, when Kim promised to work for the "government".
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "trade" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
“The United States strives to be ‘first denuclearized’ and increase the pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their purpose by expelling them, putting obstacles even to the ‘war’ declaration of ending,” he said.
“The perception that sanctions can knel us is a dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our infidelity.”
R.I. did not report a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader noted in the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, announced three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moun Jing in the past five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, such denuclearization would not be Korean denuclearization."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the target of the U.S. container with Balistic North Korean missiles was inevitable because the "Good President" Trump called him out.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "restruct" North Korea last year, chose Kim's invasion for his courage to proceed with disarmament measures, but said that there must be still much to be done and that sanctions must remain in force.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no schedule for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and irrevocably until complete, final and confirmed denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to eliminate the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pionyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip hasn’t gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, in order to accuse him a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster."
North Korea pledged to meet Mun this month to dry a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "equivalent measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and promoted the consolidation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend lessons on how to relax enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University seeks all graduate students to sleep more in an effort to fight the growing number of cultures of the whole night study with the consumption of a lot of caffeine.
One academic found that students at the university number 1 worldwide often don’t know basic things, e.g. how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chiesler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is his first kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after a speech on the effects of sleep delay on learning.
"In the end, a girl came and said to me, 'Why do I learn about this just now, in my last year?'"
She said that no one had ever spoken to her about the importance of sleep – something that surprised me,” she said in the newspaper The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were undergoing an important degree in a week of sleep.
The hourly lesson includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a student bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to inform about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleeping, sports performances are affected by a lack of sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of vomiting, brain, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it won’t change the student’s behavior immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health impacts when you choose to smoke,” said Professor Chiesler.
His culture to be proud of because you have studied the whole night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleeping is a problem that is stirred up.
Sufficient sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep stealing puts the brain in a state of lyrics, resulting in a dissatisfaction.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physics, helped Professor Chiesler design the course, attending one of his last year's classes, his first year in Harvard.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a lesson throughout the university.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar program before they start their studies in this particularly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler advised students to adjust a warning for the time they should go to sleep, as well as a awakener for the time of awakening, and to know the harmful consequences of the "blue light" problems emitted from electronic screens and LED speed lighting, which can disconnect it.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Mega puts a goal on Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad defeat outside of the seat, as Dolly Mega's hit led Stephen Gerard's decoordinated side to 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team sought to mark its first victory outside the February triomphe with the 4-1 in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team caused only Gerard's second defeat in the first position in 18 games as a coach, leaving La's eight-grade championship team behind.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-year-old, and the Renders' breathtaking roster seemed unable to repay.
While Rangers now falls into sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with just a goal difference from Hibernians.
And Rangers can expect other problems, as Supervisor Callum Spens had to receive first aid for head injury caused by an object that was flying from the outskirts.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's composition and put Eer into the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Levi 11" that took a degree from Harts last week and would be delighted with the way that his cockroaches were able to overcome every opponent’s effort.
Rangers may have dominated the occupation, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when the first remote whole of Mega sent Scott Pitman into Alan McGregor, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deeply free Kigan Jacobs found Commander Craig Halkett, but the defender of his fellow Alan Lithous was the only thing he could do was to send the ball away from the doctor.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to have more hope than faith for the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos believed he should have won a penalty at 15' as he fought with Stephen Loules, but arbitrator Stephen Thomson ignored Colombian complaints.
Rangers had only two suits within the area in the first half of the year, but the former Emprox guard, Liam Kelly, did not worri about Lasa Kulibali's head and Ovi Egaria's subcontinent suits.
Although Libye was clearly lower than expectations in the first 34 minutes of the match, no one can deny that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arphild did not react when Declane Galhaher played the ball at Scott Robinson, who maintained his cold and found Mega who simply completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half-year-old by drawing Kulibali and putting Ryan Kent in. The change turned out almost immediately, as the extruder pulled the ball into Moroleos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to hide the guests in the game style he knows and enjoys, with the Litgous and Halkett to remove one distant ball after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference at the end, but McGreegor faced Jacobs in the same way, stoping him before Litgous's efforts from Corner.
Rangers' deputy Glen Middleton had another stage for Pennsylvania at the end, as he fought with Jacobs, but again Thomson ignored it.
Germany: The inventor of Gaiker's meter
A page from the German Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882: as today, 136 years ago and Balde ... the day that was born in Germany by future physicist John Wilhelm Hans Gaiker.
Gaiker developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately led to the device now known as Gaiker.
As a pillar of science since then, Gaiker has passed in the pop culture squad, like in the 1950s film titled Bells of Coronado, with protagonists of unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Men: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Gaiker meter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as the sky.
When you wear these hearing aids, you hear the action of people caused by radiation in metal elements.”
Evans: "Look, it's crazy!"
Hans Gaiker died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that brings its name continues its work.
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune to "see" problems cells
A new anticancer vaccine teaches the immune to "see" problems cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune to identify problems in the field of treatment
The method includes immune cell export from the patient and their modification to the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein that is common in various types of cancer and subsequently become their re-infusion
A tested vaccine presents hopeful results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize problems, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes immune cells from the patient, their modification to the laboratory to "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-infusion of the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Beethoven, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands.”
As Professor Berzofsky explained, HER2 protein “is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer,” such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and thick intestines.
A similar approach to which immune cells are exported from patients and then "trained" how to target cancer cells has been used for the treatment of a type of leukemia.

Cannie West was dismissed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an interview with US President Donald Trump and said he would be a candidate in the 2020 elections.
After presenting the third song for the evening, titled Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a baseball hat with the Make America Great Again slogan (Let's make America Great Again again), he gave the Democrats a record of fraud and resumed his support.
"Sometimes I talk to a white man and he says to me, "But how do you like Trump? He's racist?"
If racism had worried me, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch in which Matt Damon was playing, with Hollywood's star to discriminate against Bret Cavano's statement before the Secretary-General's Court Committee on Critin Blazi Ford's complaints about sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't transmitted, West's video was up on social media by comedy Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock tried to discourage West with this post.
West also protested to the public that he was not well behaved in the scenes due to his hat.
"They made me bullying on the scenes.
They said, "Don't get out of the hat."
They made me bullying!
And they say that I don't know what's going on to me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "I don't know what's going on with me? I'll wear some superman, because so no one can tell me what to do. You want the world to go ahead?
Try love.”
His comments were tested at least twice by the public and the SNL coefficients seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety said, with a person saying in the magazine: "The entire studio possessed deadly silentness."
West was called a substitute for the last moment of the singer Ariana Grante, whose former friend, Raper Mac Miller, had experienced a few days earlier.
West blew several when he sang the I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West supports Candas Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who said to him: "At one of the most courageous spirits: IN THE RESULTS ON THE HEALTH."
However, the broadcaster, Karen Hunter, told him that West was just "himself and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is instinctive and exhibiting an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“The same thing we do,” he added.
Before the show, Raper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the one that was previously known as Cannie West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Paff Daddy, Paffy and P. Diddy.
Raper Snow Dog had changed his name to Snow Leon and, of course, the legend of Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Category of murder attempts for knife attack in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old was accused of murder after a knife attack on a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balikhamor, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast First Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Prosecutor.
The Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harrison, criticizes toxic harmfulness
Kit Harrison is known for his role as John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO, Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor criticizes the mass hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen pass the message to small boys that they should be hard to gain respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something's going wrong" and asked how to fight the problem of toxic harmfulness in #MeToo's era.
Kate, who recently married his partner at the Game of Thrones, Rose Lesley, also 31, admitted that he had a "strong view" on the subject.
"Personally, now, I believe so much. Where did we make the wrong with the rivalry?" he said.
"What do we learn from men as they grow, about the problem we see now?"
Kate believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic harmfulness due to the harmful characters that it promotes.
He continued, "What is infused and what is taught?
What is taught in TV and streets, which makes young boys feel that they need to show such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time. How can we change it?
Obviously something has gone wrong with our young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "the end of battles and horses".
Since November, Kate will play in the revival of the True West project by Sam Sheppard, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actress recently revealed that his familiarity with Rose's wife is the best thing he did from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so in some way she gave me my future family and my life from there onwards," he said.
Rose underwent Igrit, John Snow's loving-kindness, the character that Kate underwent, in Emmy's award-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Lesley’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820,000 people are affected, according to healthcare services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In their tremendous majority, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, signaling a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, the HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost zeroed, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunan province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LOT community in China.
Homosexuality was denied in China in 1997, but discrimination on behalf of the OECD community remains a common phenomenon.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Walters doubts that a leader has passed the data of Republican elderly governments, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy visions"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxin Waters broke out the claims that her staff member published personal information of three Republican seniors on the Wikipedia pages of the law.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles said that the claims were promoted by commentators and websites of the "right edge".
"Lies, lies, and more terrible lies," Walters said on Twitter.
The information published includes the residence addresses and telephone numbers of the elderly Lidsey Graham in South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch in Yuta.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday and appears to be published by an unknown person from the environment by Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Secretary-General's Committee on allegations on sexual offences against the applicant to the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano.
The collapse took place at a time after the three officers had interrogated Kavano.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of publications was linked to the Waters office and published data from a Waters staff member, The Hill said.
"This unfair claim is totally true and false lies," Walters continued.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated due to these false and false claims, was in no way responsible for the breakdown of this information.
This unreasonable claim is totally true and false lies.”
Waters' statement quickly adopted criticism on the Internet, among other things by former White House press secretary Ari Fleisser.
"This dissatisfaction is full of anger," Flesher wrote.
"This shows that he doesn't have the right to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be brave.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and quiet.”
Flesher seemed to compare Walter's reaction to the criticism of the Democrats for Judge Kavano, who was accused by his critics of appearing very angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to expand Walters in the interim elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he said.
In her statement, Walters stated that her office had notified "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false allegations".
"We will do everything we can to find the officials," he continued, "and be responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and to all my staff."
Johnny English Rehachipta - a hypothonic espionage film with Ryan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new British film with a character and this seems to be valid in this revival of action-commodity film franchise with hero Johnny Inglis, which started in 2003 with Johnny English film and re-released in 2011
Can this snowy self-drive on the issue of how obviously we are to become the new opportunity for the nation's exports?
In any case, infamous Johnny Inglis with the swirled eyes has been able to renew his permission to make them for a second time. His name states that it is a broader comic creation designed for non-English movie viewers.
Of course, it's an amazed secret agent who is supposed to have the brightness and the ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Kluso, with a dosage of "Master Bin" and something from the 2012.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once underwent Barclaycard's most forgotten television ads, triggering the chaos in his past.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this last JE film.
I liked when Johnny Inglis approached a helicopter dressed with a medieval gun, and the kidneys hit his crane.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, the humor is quite hypotensive and strange paranoid, especially when "serious" film franchise such as the 007 and Dangerous Mission now contain a lot of comic elements.
Humor seems to be directed to children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny Inglis's crazy reluctance is not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's film boobs for Bin's person.
The eternal central issue is that the UK has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has invaded a super-secret online network of British spywares, putting in the form the identity of all British agents in mission, to a great disappointment of the agent's little role in service, which is undertaken by Kevin Kevin.
It is the last drop for a smuggling and ambitious prime minister who is at the edge of her collapse due to political opposition: Emma Thomson does everything he can with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario does not help her especially.
Information advisers inform her that, as every active spy has been revealed, she should retrieve a disarmad person.
And that means Johnny Inglis, who now works as a director at some aristocratic school, but gives informal lessons for mysterious agents: here are some beautiful scenes, as Inglis offers an academy of spying type A School of Very Rock.
Inglis returns to Whitehall for urgent updates and reconnects with the former and patient partner of Baff, who is back undergoing Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the Gaffes for the Secret Service of this Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful and shared Ofelia Buletova who is subjected to Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by the charismatic billionaire technology that claims it can solve Britain's technological turmoil: the threatening Jason Volta, which is underway by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Baff start their farscoomy dress: transfigured as servitors, throwing fire into a thick French restaurant, cause chaos of the internal Violence device to become a real Violence as they are trying to illegally use it as the Violence is a luxurious anchor, and the Voolte is a luxurious yacht.
All of the holes are used in this last scene, but as precious and fascinating as it is, it continues to remember a little child television.
Medium things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role in which he will really grow with his talent?
Workers complain that they are considering a plan to work for British four-days, but pay for five-days
Jeremy Corbin’s Working Party will consider a radical plan to work for the British four days a week, but pay for five-day work.
The party, according to information, seeks the boss of companies to provide the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (I) to workers, giving them an additional free day.
Thus, workers will enjoy the three-day weekend, without reducing their wage.
Sources report that the idea is consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to return the weight for workers.
The four-day change was approved by the Congress of Workers' Communities as a way to benefit employees from the changing economy.
A higher source from the Working Party said in The Sunday Times: "It is expected to announce a policy change before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen in a night, but the four-day work week is an ambition that is equivalent to the party’s approach to rebalance the economy for workers, as well as its overall industry strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Prison Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party’s policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Government Secretary John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonald's said he was determined to regain power from "individual managers" and "profits" to shared companies.
The shadow government secretary’s plans also mean that today’s shareholders in aquatic companies may not take back their entire share, as a potential government of the Workers could take place in “sacrifice” due to suspicious disasters.
It also confirmed the plans for the placement of employees in the boards of companies and for the creation of mutual funding to grant 10% of the private sector companies to employees receiving annual shares of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk at 60 Minutes on whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into prosecutions against Judge Bret Kavano delayed his final vote for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question whether the conclusions of the service could affect some Republican defendants for the general generals.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Peley, a 60 Minutes broadcaster, asked Republican General John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Yes, it's me," Kennedy said.
"I said, when I went to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him straight away, “Don’t you do it?”
He was immortal, determined, accustomed."
However, Graham's vote seems not to change.
"I have decided on Bret Cavano and it will need some explosive charge to change my opinion," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Bret denied it intensely," Greham added, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever has named it cannot confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see something new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and famous stars, as well as an equally impressive mission: the eradication of global poverty.
For seven years now, tens of thousands are expected to run at the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi Bee and Son Menthes, but also to feel about the final 2030 goal of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure team that is expected to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of actively fighting against it.
To ensure a free ticket at the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), the stakeholders had to complete a series of missions or "actions" such as volunteers, sending an email to a global leader's targets to call their messages, call or find other goods.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of a free concert a good way to convince our citizens to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicking” when some feel that they really do the difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen team has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, promoting a number of different targets.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies corresponding to over $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been deposited or accumulated.
The team estimates that insured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British union of investors and executives, who have committed to "aid children to fully exploit their capabilities", promising to give to Rwanda two700s of the globality over $35 million of its members.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a subnote to history," said Trey Ulman, Ambassador to The Power of Nutrition in 2018.
The group also stated that after the 5,000 actions and more calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, aimed at 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
Answering the question "what makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the frequently asked questions on the website,
A member of the Global Citizen community replied: “The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great movements for human rights and against the addiction before us, we will succeed because we are united stronger.
Janet Jackson, Whicket, Son Minds, Cardi Bi and Janel Mona are some of the artists who will appear this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Le-Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use the Navy to "explode" by preventing Russia's energy exports
Washington may turn "if necessary" to its Navy to prevent the disposal of Russian energy in the markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zenke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinek argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it is attempting to be invited by the legal government, is a decision to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the Minister, there are ways to deal with Russian activity.
“The United States, with the support of the Navy, has the ability to ensure that the maritime roads will remain open and, if necessary, exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy will not be marketed,” he said.
Zenke was addressed to the participants in the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is classified as the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to address Russia and Iran, noting that they are basically the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, little-much, the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "poon that only knows a flood", as it has an economy that depends on the mineral fuel.
The statements took place as the Trump administration has taken the mission to strengthen the exports of U.S. liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the far cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump’s administration, including President Donald Trump’s own, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that, according to Trump, will become Berlin “the deputy.”
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2, a project with a budget of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic measures, is a pure financial project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s loyal resistance to the project is motivated for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure exercise and that consumers should have the ability to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said in a meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State.
The U.S. attitude caused Germany’s reaction, which emphasized its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kemph, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Roso Preso.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of declaring candidate for the Presidency in 2020, Massachusetts said.
Massachusetts Vice-President Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would seriously consider the possibility of declaring candidate for the Presidency after the intermediate elections.
At a meeting in the Massachusetts Hallouk County, Warren confirmed that he considered the possibility.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our problematic government, and that’s why they need a woman at the top,” The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will consider the possibility of a nomination for the Presidency."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying "he leads the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” he said.
Warren didn't tell her words about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course, a FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not believe that they should apply for the presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts' "potential" elections said the mayor should not apply, according to a survey from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a possible candidate than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other popular names of the Democrats discussed in connection with a possible candidate for 2020 are former Vice President Joe Byden and Vice President Berni Sanders of Vermont.
Baden said he would have officially decided until January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Paelin reported on Trak Paelin's Transitional Strait Disorder at Donald Trump's concentration
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his employment in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of Transtraumatic Strait Disorder and the injuries that our soldiers bear when they return home," he said.
Paline characterized his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and told her son and other veterans that "they recognize a little different, they return harder, they return from a member of the army, if there is respect for each other, the air forces have done for the country."
She was arrested on Monday in Wazilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, intervention in a report of domestic violence and obstacle while being in a state of affairs, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wazilla police department.
18 states and the region of Colombia support the suspicion of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the region of Colombia support a legal question of the new U.S. policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims who are trying to get rid of bands or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the region submitted an amicus curiae report in Washington on Friday, supporting an asylum seeker to question politics, NBC News said.
The full name of the injured in Grey v. Seion, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics, has not been revealed.
She said her "and her violent sons who are members of the band" had violated her, however, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He had been held in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Andorra and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come from the United States as countries faced severe problems with bands and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy rejected the 2014 decision taken by the Immigration Mission Commission (BIA) and allowed unemployed immigrants who fled from domestic violence situations to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the region of Colombia, Carl Rashin, said Friday that the new policy "is ignoring all decades of state, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the specific events and circumstances of the application. Such a collapse violates this principle," said amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that refuses entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "render the necessary workforce".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sesians ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims trying to escape domestic violence and bandits.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or threats due to races, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political view," Seion said in a statement on 11 June on politics.
The aim of asylum was never to relieve all the problems (even the most serious) faced by people every day around the world.
The number of dead is doubled despite the fight for the finding of survivors.
For survivors, the situation was constantly worsening.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby with fever, in a exile center located in the damaged city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings other bodies.
The clean water is split.”
Some residents attempted to return to their damaged homes and collect their existence through the waters, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, who suffered an earthquake damage from 7.5-scale Richter scale, failed to meet their needs.
Some injured, such as Douie Harris, who suffered a middle and shoulder chastisement, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the first aid was given to the hospital due to the ongoing strong transfers.
Tears flooded his eyes as they told him how he felt the violent earthquake to shatter the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I've been on the walls," Harris said in the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife shouting for help, but then she kept silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "experienced" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-year-old advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper overwhelming the mutual trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. Pre-Type.
U.S. President Donald Trump reported last Wednesday on the China Daily’s pay-off bill, which appeared in the Des Moines Register, the newspaper with the most sales in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to mix in Congress elections on 6 November, China accused.
Trump's accusation that Beijing has attempted to interfere in U.S. elections signaled what U.S. officials reported to Reuters that it is a new phase of the climb campaign that Washington has overcome to exercise pressure in China.
Although foreign governments are not prohibited to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a climb trade war and have imposed various import duties on each other.
China's customs opposition at the beginning of the trade war was intended to injure exporters to states such as the Iowa supported by the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American experts said.
The U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term governor in Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had injured workers, farmers and American businesses.
China, as Branst wrote in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register, “is posted to this kind of fear by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the valuable tradition of American freedom of speech and freedom of the press, publishing a paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
"On the contrary, in the surroundings of Beijing, you will find minimal divergence voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have about the problematic economic course of China, since the SMEs are under the control of the Communist Party."
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers had avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal who.
Republicans dismiss women voters in view of interim elections due to a friend with Kavano, analysts warn
As many leading Republicans continue to defend the applicant for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano despite complaints of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, to the next intermediate elections.
The feelings about this issue are particularly sharp and most Republicans have stated that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be restored,” said Grand River, Professor of Political Science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, regarding an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the movement of the last moment of General Jeff Fleck (R-Arzona) to ask for an investigation from the FBI will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, will not forget it tomorrow, and will certainly not forget it in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national media representative of the Washington Progressive Group.
On Friday morning, protesters regularly shouted the word "November is coming!" at the General's runway as the Republicans who control the Court of Justice gave green light for the Cavanano candidate, despite Dr. Micerin Cryst's testimony.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," said St. Roodenberg, an incomplete political analyst, in a press release.
“They say it’s already high, and that’s true.
“But it could be higher, especially in the group of disrespectful women voters in the preachers and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while opposing the president, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford’s public deposit, in which she detailed her complaints of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court’s applicant, the analysts had predicted that there could be a reaction as the Republicans proceed with the shame.
"It's a huge chaos for the Republican Party," Michael Still, former President of the National Committee of Republicans, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about voting in the committee or the final voting or whether Kavano will be put out. It's also about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they handled it," said Gay Sesil, aid channel of the USA.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly separated from who to believe after the deposits of Fort and Cavano, drawing slightly more in favour of the second.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents surely or likely believed Ford's deposit, while 35% said surely or likely believed Kavano.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Kavano probably lied in his warehouse, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Fleck's move, the FBI took off to investigate Ford's complaints and at least one more complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore to the General Court of Justice that Kavano was attacked while being drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her gender organs while they were at a party, when both studied in Wales in the 1980s.
Global Site inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Site, starts a startup to compete on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new pain of this legend of technology is Inrupt, a company based on the open platform Solids of Burns Lee.
Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee stated that the intention behind Inrupt is the "global sovereignty".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the platform’s Solid technology allowing users to create their own “personal electronic data storage space” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, workout lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all of them at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal electronic storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this possibility "personal reinforcement through data".
Inrupt’s idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is to offer resources, procedures and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some advanced developers who worked on the project and a community of voluntary code developers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernard Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they were allowed to make radical changes, turning business models into one night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a publication in Medium published Saturday, Bernard Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new tissue created on the basis of the Solid platform."
In 1994, Bernard Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Over the past few months, Berners Lee has been a strong voice in the debate on the Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic for the next Internet era," Bernard Lee added.
Bernard Van: Tax of honor to a clergy who received the Cross of Victory in World War I
The only clergy of the English Church who received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a soldier was honoured in the country of 100 years later.
Adjunct Colonel Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, he was killed by a free shooter four days later and never learned that he had broken off the highest British military discrimination.
On Saturday, the discoveries of a memorable plateau of his two grandchildren, accompanied by a trajectory in Rasden, Northhakhabtssair, were made.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "excellently symbolic" that the revelations of the plateau were just 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his decree on the Channel of Saint-Keen in the midst of a very dense shark, while accepting strong weapons of war and multibowls.
Later, he hurried to the front line and with "excellent courage" led the line forward, before he hit him alone with a fighting weapon three of the extract.
Colonel Van was killed by a German free shooter on 4 October 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Van, said his grandfather's heroic acts were "what I know I could never reach, is something that makes you feel unlimited respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also launched a steep after the show, led by the filamentary new Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said "he felt great honour to participate in the retreat" and added that "the courage of a true hero is proven by the support he has from many people."
MMA fans visited Bellator 206, but saw Peppa Gurunaki.
Think of the following scenario: you’ve visited to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you’re missing the pleasure to see this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six main cards, and would be played live in the UK, from Channel 5, in the nighttime zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mussai and Rory McDonald were preparing to go out to the ring, the UK viewers remained silent when the show changed the Gurunaki in Peppa.
Some weren’t pleased at all, as they stayed awake until the first morning hours, especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described the view of the child program as “some sorts of sick joke.”
“In accordance with the legislation, this content was not suitable for six in the morning, so the child program had to be provided,” said Dave Swart, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked for the broadcast.
"Papa's Wurduneaki, even."
Bellator’s president Scott Cooker said he was going to edit the program to include the UK viewers in the future.
"If we think of the rifles, I think we can do it," Coker said.
“But it’s six Sunday morning there and we won’t be able to do it until Sunday’s time, that is, Monday’s time.
But we're trying it.
Believe me, when the change occurred, many messages were exchanged before-behind and were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It was not, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five games instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer more fans and we did it.
It’s an unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" due to his sexuality
The Olympics at the invasion, Tom Daley, said he grew up feeling lower than the other because of his sexuality, but this encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realized until high school that "there's not all like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs presented by Loren Lavern at Radio 4, he said he supported gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he was less interested in a victory at the Olympics.
Kirsty Yang, a regular performer of the well-known radio broadcast, was on vacation for several months due to illness.
As an invitation to Labourn's first broadcast, Daley said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
“To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity gave me the power and will to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympics is a protector of the LOTK community's rights and has been exploited by its participation in the European Union Games this year in Australia to make an appeal to more countries to advance in denialization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without any impact, and that he wanted to give to other "hope".
The three-time world champion said it was "a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dastin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year with Oscar Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older, but argued that the age difference had never been a matter.
"When you spend so much at such a young age" (the first time participated in the 14-year-old Olympics, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it is difficult to find a companion who has similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Black-Daley, and Daley said he had changed "all his perspective."
“If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal,” he said.
"But there are more important things than the golden olive medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had taken tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Daddy, you won’t be next to us to sit in the first row,” he said.
"I held his hand as he ceased to breathe and only when he ceased to breathe and was already dead I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the iron medal.
"I knew it was what I dreamed of all my life, to fight at the Olympics in my homeland, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of the first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which endorsed him during his preparation for the Olympics and even causes him anxiety.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson's off-former will sit on the floor Saturday at Ryder Cup
U.S. Phil Michaelson will celebrate a record on Sunday, when he plays his 47th match at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance in order not to remember him for the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who participates for the 12th time (number of records) in the matches organized every two years, was forced by Chief Jim Furrick to sit on the pavement for the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of action, as usual for the United States, the winner five times a day split out of lines and "working" his game hoping he will fix his problem points.
Without having ever been the most straightforward driver even in his career’s outskirts, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for Le Golf National’s narrow field, where the remote are often problematic.
And as if the ground had not reached the difficulty, Michaelson, in the ninth Sunday match, faces Francesco Molinari, champion of the British Open, who collaborates with the first-born Tommy Flytwood to win the four weeks.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the beginning of the 12 singles, could take the lead with a good start, Michaelson game can be critical.
Furrick expressed his trust in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully received the role he plays today, hit me friendly in his back, put his hand around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has great self-confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and has offered too much to these groups, both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't calculate him to play two games.
I thought more, but there we finished, and so we thought we had to go.
He wants to go out there, like everyone else."
Michaelson will overcome Nick Faldo’s record for most Sunday matches at the Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that did not reach the height of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halfs, although Furrick said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, breathtaking, he likes to make plates and he's great in the team's room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed experimenting with him this week. It was fun to see it.
His contribution is not just in the game.”
The leader of the European Group, Thomas Biorn, knows that the big progress can be lost soon
Thomas Biorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a big progress that starts with the last day singles at the Ryder Cup can easily be transformed into a defeat.
Denmark made his debut at the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team with leader Sheve Balsteros managed to gain five-degree advantages against Americans, but just managed to pass the final line with chest differences.
"You remember yourself constantly that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just after violence," Biorn, on the image, said, as he was watching at National, as he was watching in 2018, and as Le was going to win 5-3.
So the story will show to me and to all the team members that this hasn't finished.
We're going ready tomorrow to give it all.
We're going out there and we're going to play right.
Nothing has ended until you see the degrees in the table.
We have a goal, to win this trophy, and we focus there.
I always say I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that in the other team there are equally good players – the best in the world.”
Aligned with the performance of his players on a tough golf course, Byron adds: "I wouldn't be ashamed to prejudice the result.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow it counts individual performance and this is something different.
It's great to be on the ground with a companion when things go well, but when you're out there alone, then you're experiencing your skills as a golfer.
This is the message you have to transmit to players, how to make the best of themselves tomorrow.
Leave your lover back and he must give everything and show himself the best.”
Unlike Biorn, Jim Furrick from the opponent team will ask his players to perform better individual performance than those they had with their colleagues, except for Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Furrick himself has experienced both ends of the last day’s turnover as he belonged to the winning team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every speech of his word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Krenso, the boss in 1999, had collected his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like Medinah.
When we get this race, there is a lot of pressure on the intermediate matches.
We decide our series accordingly and play the series that suits us, we’ll try to do our magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has taken over to lead the game and face Rory Macylory in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Roses, John Ram, Tommy Flittwood and Ian Potter, the rest of the Europeans over half of the series.
"I went with this team in this series because I think it covers the entire route," Biorn said, justifying his choices for singles.
New resignation for Germany's new warship
The new German Navy fleet should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not be received until at least the next year, due to defect systems and the inflamed costs, local media report.
The position in service of the Rheinland-Pfalz fragrance, Baden-Wuerttemberg fragrance, has been revoked until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which is called for a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with the delivery were crucial for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen-class freighters.
They will carry a powerful canon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles on ships, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, sub-red and audio signatures.
Another important feature is that the frequency of maintenance works is reduced, as new freight can be used for up to two years outside German ports.
Continuous delays, however, mean that although warships are considered to be the latest technology, which will allow Germany to show its power abroad until they finally put into service, they will be already overcome.
The F125 fragrance took place last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned to a ship after the ship was delivered.
There was no known much information about the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a number of significant "crashes with software and hardware" that would be put into use the warship if they were used in a battle mission.
Software problems were particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg ships have approximately 120 naval crews, just half compared to the oldest Bremen ships.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much higher weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz freight is believed to weigh twice as much as the vessels of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defect equipment, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) was also a subject.
It is claimed to have reached the total amount of €3.1 billion (3.6 billion) and the initial budget was €2.2 billion.
The problems that breastfeeding the new breastfeeders are particularly important because the naval force of Germany is rising.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy will “not have ships for missions in a short time.”
The official stated that the problem was distorted over time, because the old vessels were dismantled, but there were no other vessels to replace them.
It was confirmed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg brigades could join the Navy.
National Trust covers the secret life of nightmares
New research conducted in a property in Scotland seeks to discover how nightmares use the landscape when hunting their food.
The findings will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique breastfeeders and will contribute to the design of future environmental protection actions.
The study by scholars of the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanoparticle and micronutrition, as well as the coffee of Nottingham and myotis at the Inverewe Gardens gardens in Wester Ross.
Special subscribers will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor nightclub activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Analysis of the sound of all recordings by specialists will check the frequency of night calls, as well as what kinds of such behaviour they have.
Then, a biotope map and an exhibition will be created to form a detailed picture of their behavior on landscape scale.
Rob Dowar, natural environmental adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for nightcloths and how they are used by any kind.
This information will help to identify the benefits of life management, such as forest creation and the best way to preserve forests for nightmares and other related species.
The population of nightmares in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has significantly decreased since the last century.
They are threatened by construction work and development projects that affect the places where they are tired and destroying their lives.
Wind generators and lighting are also a danger, as well as friendly films on mushrooms and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks from residential cats.
The nightmares aren't really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their caption.
They use an advanced sound detection technique to detect insects and obstacles during their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers nightmares very important.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular investigations, inspect the places where nightcloths crash and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and unique refuge exclusively for nightclubs in the property Threave, in Damfries and Galoway, where eight of the ten species of Scotland’s nightclubs live.
Building manager David Thomson says the property is the ideal ground for nightclubs.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent area for nightclubs," he said.
“We have old buildings, many large trees and an ideal habitat.
There’s still a lot that we don’t know about nightmares, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to increase their populations.”
It stresses that it is important to first check for the existence of nightmares before any maintenance work in homes, as the destruction of one and only a small bowl could kill up to 400 females and small, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
The nightmares are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, disturb them, or disturb their calm, or destroy their lights.
Elizabeth Ferel, head of Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said, “There is still a lot to learn about our nightclubs and for many of our species we simply don’t know the evolution of their population.”
Ronaldo refuses complaints of rape as his lawyers are preparing to send a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the complaints of rape against him as "fake news," saying that some "will be self-proclaimed" using his name.
His lawyers will send the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The Portuguese and Yuventus attacker is accused of raping a American woman named Catherine Mayorga in the room of a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, it is supposed to pay her $375,000 to buy her silence and not report anything about the incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
Speaking to a live video on Instagram to 142 million fans after the complaint, 33-year-old Ronaldo characterized the "fake news" reports.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner at the camera.
“They want to be self-produced and exploited my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
“I’m happy and everything’s fine,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to send Der Spiegel for the allegations he published, which they characterized as “unacceptable reporting of privately touching fame,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Scherts said the player would ask for compensation for “ethical damage to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy over the past few years.”
The alleged event is claimed that it took place in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After their meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorca returned to the player's room, where they were forced to rape her beyond nature, according to documents submitted to the Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to the knees after the alleged incident and told her that it was "99 percent" a "good guy", but betrayed the other "one percent".
The documents indicate that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual contact, but that it was consensual.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because "she was afraid of the possibility of counterparts" and was worried about her "public evacuation".
The 34-year-old says she is trying to reverse the settlement as she continues to suffer from a traumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the windows to get a transposition to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the period of alleged abuse, and this summer he passed to Italian Euventus by ensuring an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will regret the loss of automotive industries forever"
The United Kingdom "will regret forever" if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit," Prime Minister Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was "anxiety" that Toyota UK told BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese automotive industry said the impact of cross-border delays in the case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models were manufactured, delivered nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were expelled to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Martin Cook, Toyota's CEO in Berlin.
And other car industries in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to risks in the supply chain according to automotive industries in case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line follows the just-in-time. Parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured after order.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the borders, resulting in delays and lack of components according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold a warehouse beyond one day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "deployed specifically to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best possible deal that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to exploit this opportunity," he said at BBC Radio 4.
“The elements that come from not only Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that we must necessarily ensure the continuity of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how hard it would stop production, however, warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Chuvallaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the Union Union official at the factory, said that members of the unit are increasingly worried: “From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return again.
"We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may delay again, the White House announces.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Round Rosenstein may "delay another week" as the dispute for the Supreme Court candidate, Bret Cavano, continued, announced Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, Trump’s interconnections with Russia and the possible prevention of justice by the president.
The possibility for Trump to release the Deputy Prosecutor General, threatening Miller’s independence, is feeding Washington’s potatoes for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility to wear a curious in order to record his conversations with Trump and make it possible to remove the president under Amendment 25.
Rosenstein refused the report.
However, last Monday, he moved to the White House with reports that he was supposed to resign.
Instead, it was announced on Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations Agency in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to release Roshenstein, but the meeting delayed in order not to conclude with the hearing before the General Committee on Discrimination, to which both Kavano and one of the women who were accused of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the claims against Kavano within a week, delaying more vote than the Mayor's plenary.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokeswoman, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There has not been a date yet, maybe this week, but maybe another week of data of all other cases occupied by the Supreme Court.
But we'll see it, and I like to always update the guy."
Some journalists opposed this allegation: Sanders has made a press release to the White House since September 10.
Speaker Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of the updates was not due to dissatisfaction with the "impression" movements of television journalists, although she said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are shown."
He then let it mean that it will increase or direct communication between Trump and the type.
"The President gives more interviews than any former President," he said, adding without submitting evidence: "We looked at these numbers."
They will continue to be updated, Sanders said, but "if the guy has the ability to address questions directly to the President of the United States, this is incomparably better than talking to me.
We are trying to apply it frequently and you have seen that we have applied it frequently in the last few weeks and it will take the position of the press release where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press interviews with official visitors.
Individual press interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why this is happening, with an anti-contractual and sometimes strange appearance in front of concentrated journalists.
Health Minister sends a letter to EU citizens working on the Scottish National Health System in the midst of fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the EU citizens employed in the Scottish National Health System to express their gratitude and to wish them to remain and after leaving the UK from the European Union.
Jean-Friman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter while remaining less than six months to leave the UK from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of requests for permanent resident status (settled status) for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Mrs. Friman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on departure continued and are going to the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario of failure to reach an agreement.
I know that this period should be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee regardless of nationality.
Partners from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the healthcare work, and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercroby is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Defender Christo Ambercroby was undergoing an emergency surgery after a head injury in the Saturday race, where Tennessee State Tigers were defeated with 31-27 scores by Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee’s main coach Rond Rid told reporters that the injury occurred just before a half-year-old.
"He came to the armor and just collapsed there," Rid said.
The coach and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie in the pan and then put it in a carriage and brought it back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State boss told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Nasville, Tennessee that Ambercroby had gone out of the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no evidence yet about the type/extension of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Ambercrombie, a secondary student under a limited participation regime ("redshirt"), has passed his first season in Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total doubles on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching the 18 total doubles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher card fees for real estate purchase in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher cash fee for the purchase of real estate in the UK, while additional funds will be used to provide assistance to residents, according to the new plans of Tory
The measure will eliminate the success of the Corbin campaign to attract young voters
Increase in cash end will be imposed to buyers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to accumulate up to 120 million pounds of England per year - to provide assistance to assistants
Foreign buyers will begin to impose a higher cash fee for the purchase of real estate in the UK, while additional funding amounts will be used to provide aid to assaults, as Teresa May announced today.
The measure will be regarded as an attempt to eliminate the success of Jeremy Corbin’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more economical housing and to target high-ends.
The increase in the end of the portfolio will be imposed on natural and legal persons not taxed in the UK, while additional funds will strengthen the government’s campaign to combat the deficiency of rooftops.
The increase, imposed on the current end of the wallet, along with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second housing and housing for settlement, can reach three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will cost up to 120 million pounds of England a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newlywed real estate in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom people, leading to price rise and making it more difficult for buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich regions of the country – especially in the capital – have become “city fantasies” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the final card so that more young people can get their first residence.
He accused the major construction companies of holding the real estate prices high, gaining land without, however, using it and invited Mrs. May to remove the flats in economic housing to restore the "establishment" of Britain.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of impressive proposed domestic reforms, including rental checks and ban "no liability" expenditure.
He also wishes to grant greater powers to the councils to build new houses.
Mr. May said: "I said last year that I would devote my prime minister to the restoration of the British dream - to the improvement of life for every new generation.
And this implies the correction of the dissolved real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it wouldn’t be the right people who don’t live in the UK and companies with headquarters abroad buy homes as easily as hard-working British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of residential property has now become too far away and the dignity of the lack of roof remains existence."
Jack Ross: "My absolute ambition is to train Scotland's team"
Santerland's chief Jack Ross says his "absolute ambition" is to become a coach of the Scottish national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is excited to raise the team of Northeastern England, which is currently in third place in England's League One, three degrees below the top.
She moved to the Light Stadium in the summer, after she had previously brought St. Miran back to the Scottish Championship in the previous race season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team, and that was," Russia told the Scottish BBC at the Sportsound radio broadcast.
“But I grew up seeing the Scottish team in Hubben constantly with my dad as a child, and that’s something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will come only if I succeed in training teams.”
Among the predecessors of Russia in Santerland are Dick Andocaath, David Moyais, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Poichett, and Paolo Di Cannio.
Aloa Athletic’s former coach said that he was not feeling bad when he was called to accept such a set names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"This time the success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question, "Can I bring this team back to Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this team, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get her there, but I’ll probably consider myself successful here only if I can bring the team back there.”
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a time as a coach assistant at Dabarton and a time of 15 months at Harts coach staff.
He then helped Aloe return from the subway to the third category and led St. Mirane from the lips of the subway to the conquest of the championship in the next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartboll, Fullerck, St. Miren and Hamilton Kandemikal.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he said recalled taking the position of Aloa’s coach.
“I really thought it was better for me to be a coach than a player.

The best time for beer is at 5.30m on Saturdays, according to research
The summer carbon has strengthened the profits for the UK’s tested bombs but has brought greater pressure on the restaurants chains.
The bombs and bars noticed a sales increase of 2.7 percent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA advisory company, who collected the data, said: "The continuous sunshine and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July's growth.
The 1.8% reduction in restaurant revenue in June just worsened in July.
The pops and bars serving alcohol have gone far better, with the corresponding elements of the previous years have risen more than the corresponding elements of the restaurants have fallen.
Bubs serving meals also suffered sunny days, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to go out for a drink.
In all managed bubbles and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s recreational and hospitality analyst department, said: “These results verify the trend we have found since the end of April.
The time and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurants groups continue to be difficult, but the fall in sales by 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful in the ongoing cost pressure data.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for entrepreneurs in the focus area and the time will show if the lowest temperatures that we experienced in August will give a multi-potential extension."
The overall increase in sales in pops and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the surplus in commercial labels.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales indicator for the UK's bubbles, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes efficiency data from 47 active groups, with a total work cycle of more than 9 million points of reference.
One in five children keep mysterious accounts on social media, secretly from their parents
As the research reveals, one in five children - even 11 years old - keep mysterious accounts on social media, secretly from their parents and teachers.
Research from 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages on Instagram
This news encouraged fears that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "made" account to show their parents.
One in five children, even 11 years old, create accounts on social media, which they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo notification website.
This news encouraged the fears that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they maintain a healthy "made" account to show to their parents while maintaining both private and private accounts.
A mother who randomly found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to rape her ("beat me").
The research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Conference of School Directors and Directors at independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to maintaining hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Bukanan said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are subject to the temptation to create online sites where their parents and teachers can’t identify them.”
Elide Doyle will be the "Sports' Voice" in the Scottish Board of Stives
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive advisor in Scotland's Board of Directors at the annual general assembly of the managing body.
Doyle is the most awarded athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Biti commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Elidy enjoys infinite respect for the whole Scottish, British and global community of stars and we are sure that the star in Scotland will have a huge benefit from its admission to the council," Bithy said.
Doyle said, “I’m excited to perform the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who earned the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, having won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, remained paralyzed after a paradoxal ischemistry cerebral cerebral palsy.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a brainstorming.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I'm going to get rid of it.
It was exhaustive, but I completely recovered, I learned again to walk and today I do charity exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising of a beast comparing mothers with cows divides online public opinion
A livestock production company has split online public opinion with an advertisement comparing mothers breastfeeding with cows breastfeeding them.
In order to launch the so-called "worldly first noise and portable toothbrush", Elvie Consumer Technology Company has circulated a humorous advertising inspired by video clips to showcase the freedom it offers to breastfeeders the new toothbrush.
Four real mothers dance in a row of cows full of like, with a song that includes texts like, "Yes, I'm shaking myself, but you don't see any bitch" and "In case you didn't notice it, these are not my bubbles."
The chorodia continues: "Take it, take it, feed it, take it, take it, take it to my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, has raised an online contradiction.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it does not take seriously the "throat" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after birth.”
Elvie's breastfeeder is in a breastfeeder (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “Obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastplates for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A full-time advertisement outside of reality."
Others defended the advertisement, while a woman admitted that her song seemed "excruciating".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I would buy such a breastfeeder if I still breastfeed.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I haven't decided to over-analyse it.
It's a smart product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a funny advertising targeting mothers pumping mother milk (often at their workplace or toilets) and feel like "smiles."
It is not an advertising that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all of them danced with the discreet containers in their suits.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump maternal milk with tobacco say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s breastplate is totally noiseful, has no cables or tubes, and is differently inside a breastplate, allowing women to move, keep their babies and even get out during pumping.
Anna Balarin, co-partner and Executive Director of Creative at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s tobacco is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and challenging launch.
By making a parallelism between breast-feeding women and breast-feeding cows, we wanted to focus on the dust of mother milk and all the challenges it contains, simultaneously showing in a fun and related new way the incredible sense of freedom that will be free.
It's not the first time Elvie's toothbrush becomes a premiere.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the palace for the fashion designer Marta Yakukovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of children of immigrants moved to a camp at the Texas border
The number of children in custody of immigrants has reached the height, although the monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because the hard rhetoric and policies adopted by the Trump administration have become more difficult to match children.
Traditionally, most conservatives are the same immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to go out and ask for a child to put their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was enlarged in June when the federal authorities announced that potentially conservatives and other adult members of their household should provide fingerprints and that the data would be disclosed to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior official of the Immigration and Television Service, stated before Congress that the service has arrested dozens of people who were asked to retain uncompany minors.
Later, the service confirmed that 70 percent of the detained had a white criminal record.
Almost 80 percent of people who are either conservatives or members of the household of the conservatives are illegal in the country and a large portion of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these individuals,” said Albert.
In order to address children's cases faster, officials have introduced new rules in accordance with which some of these children should appear in court within one month of their detention, not within 60 days of their detention, as previously applicable, in agreement.
Many will appear through an iconic conference, in the position of the self-presentation, in order to develop their claims to grant legal status before the jurisdiction for immigration matters of a judge.
Those who believe that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be released immediately.
The more children are detained, the more likely they are to be stressed or anxious, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to refugee workers and reports that have gone out of the system in recent months.
Commons said that these concerns are intensified to larger facilities such as Turin, where indications that a child is difficult is more likely to be not perceived due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the scene without giving enough time to prepare children psychologically or say goodbye to their friends can aggravate the injury they are already fighting with.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish "potential occupation" to be withdrawn immediately
Heading to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, William al-Mualem, also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, although the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mualem, who serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the threat of fighting terrorism and "they will receive appropriate treatment."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," he said.
“The war against terrorism has almost ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been separated from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to give this sacred battle until we drive out all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which primarily train and update both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the country’s war damaged.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualeem said the conditions are good for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "discursion of irrational fears" that encouraged refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicize a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there would be no aid to rebuild Syria unless a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is reached.
The United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a desolated zone in the last major revolutionaries in Idlib has created the opportunity to promote political debates.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented an extensive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action will target jihadists, including warriors associated with Al-Qaida Front Nusra, which would be "expulsed".
UN Specialist Stefan de Mistura hopes to soon summon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Mualem laid down the terms for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "in the review of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Why will Trump win a second term?
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win again the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the mum proposal and the scandals end his presidency early.
Something that would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the Presidency of all times!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the spectators.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high-season zone have been overduplicated, reaching 1.05 million to CNN and almost triple, reaching 1.6 million to MSNBC.
The Fox News network has an average of 2.4 million high-season television watches, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's broadcasting of important news "The Rachel Maddow Show" has scanned the television shows on television.
It’s a fire that people are attracted to because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Nil Baer, producer of the dramatic series of ABC “Designed Survivor” where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Neel Scovel, a veteran film director and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
It remembers a taxi route to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
"She answered, 'Because she makes me laugh'," said Mrs. Scoobel.
You can even have fun with chaos.
Of course, unlike what is happening with television series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy case against Wayne if the families of immigrants are able to recover the health of the global economy.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged television viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you overcome the definition of an updated citizen when you are for six hours to watch a team of experts to discuss about the use of "much interviews in the scene" by Bob Woodward made the goldspots for the poster's poster's poster's poster's poster's poster's poster's poster's poster's poster's poster's poster'ss poster's poster's poster's.
Nevertheless, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What makes and gives you the feeling of the real show is that it gives you something every night," said Brad Moodgomer, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the TV program "Pawn Stars", about the constantly changing fighting, the paramount of the game.
You don't have the luxury to lose any episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside of his house on the northern coast of Kawai, but he was closed inside watching MSNBC while magneticing the CNN.
It could not be distracted, not when Bret Cavano was to present in the General General Committee of Proceedings, and the future of the Supreme Court was crushed by a cluster.
"I remember when we made those stupid emissions in the past and the world said, 'This will mean the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Flais said.
"I thought it was a joke, but it proves they were right at last."

External money enters the most restrictive account for intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania electoral district in Congress accepts money flow, thanks to the reconciliation of the Congress’ electoral regions, which put two active members of the Congress candidates for the same position.
This newly redesigned pre-astronomy region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Deputy Connor Lab, who was elected to another region in special elections held last spring.
As an opponent, Lab has another active representative, Republican Kith Ruthfus, who represents the former 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th electoral district.
The maps were reorganized after a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which held in January that the ancient regions were illegally operated in the interests of Republicans.
The election counting in the new 17th election region fired a campaign of financial competition between the largest financial divisions of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lab became popular in Pennsylvania after a limited winning in a special election count held in March for the 18th Pennsylvania electoral district in Congress, which many people attended.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the region for 20 degrees.
Political analysts give the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States examined the possibility of punishing El Salvador for his support in China, but left behind
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the colleagues dismissed the Trump administration team.
State Diphardt’s officials have decided to withdraw U.S. head of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the “pre-pressing decisions of the president to no longer recognize Taiwan,” as he said.
However, sanctions were only imposed against El Salvador, estimated to receive about $140 million as U.S. aid in 2017, among other things for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions of financial aid and targeted constraints of passport visas, would be charged with the country of Central America, with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings evolved, North and Central America officials set up a high-grade conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, following a corresponding concentration transition from the moves held last year, which was considered to be a step forward.
However, in mid-September, the top executives made it clear that they wanted to proceed to the conference, putting an end to the thoughts of imposition of sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is going to be addressed to the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, indicating the importance of the concentration for the administration, as diplomats said.
And the three U.S. dismissed returned unanimously to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
Mr Bolton, the White House's press spokesman, refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, on the basis of the following:
Their descriptions were confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in terms of anonymity.
Read History
The next strike may be the report by Mr. Trump of Special Advisor Robert Mueller on the para-production of justice, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is noted that Mr. Mueller also turns his investigation into possible consensus between Mr. Trump's electoral campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held responsible in front of the body as he is preparing for the presidential election again in the next elections and maybe in the end in front of an oath court.
The "if" is a lot and I don't mean that Mr. Trump's fall, not even his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options that we all have to do on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to fight against Hitler, if his West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of murder followed.
The word of history rotates around such places of cabins and the unsustainable course of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now faced with many of these spots.
What shall we do if Mr. Trump releases Deputy Justice Minister Rond Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he wrote on that newspaper that last year he proposed to be recorded secretly by the president and that he considered him inappropriate for the position of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the version adopted by the Times was unprecedented.
"How can we answer if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation into Bret Cavano is not complete or fair, or if it's appointed to the Supreme Court despite the massive charges of sexual assault and false deposition?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-elections a Congress that will put Mr. Trump's account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I took in Praag, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ancestral residence.
He survived, migrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to pick up the Jewish Saturday candle on that table with a sweater.
With this inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic for the Battle of Rapid Vienna
Raiders welcomed Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians, after an impressive equation in Spain with Viral earlier this month, will give her a lot of chances of prejudice from the 7th Europa League Team.
A knee injury prevented the medium Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the equation of 2-2 score with Viariareal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a reservoir for greater success.
“It was a good time for us because Vijarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game thinking we could succeed and we got out to a degree.
Maybe we could escape at the end, but, in general, equilibrium was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better team in the second half.
Today, Thursday is another big European night.
Good owners of the things, we can get three degrees, but it will be a difficult game because they brought a good result in the last game, but, with the world at the floor, I'm sure we can put our strengths and bring a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and changes in the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let’s hope that we will be able to do our best now, leave us behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose their sleep due to their fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the investigation had a clear idea of how they would like to take care, few were discussing it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the Nationwide investigation said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about this to their children.
"People want to take care of their family, but they don't take any initiative to make the relevant discussion," said Holly Schneider, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Operations.
Start with that.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how you will get care, as these options can be an important factor for determining the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your adviser may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at purchase price to help you cover these costs or self-security with your own assets - if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make an expert on health care issues to determine a reliable person to supervise your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes in case you are unable to contact.
Also, consider the possibility of making an accountant for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make your own decisions on financial issues and to ensure that your accounts are paid, in case you become non-employed.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Refer these details to a written design so that you can be ready.
“It’s not just the financial issue, but who are the doctors,” Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure to prepare this plan."
Men took multiple fires with a gun in Ilfracob
A man took multiple fires with an air gun as he walked to his house last night.
The victim, about 40, was located in the Oxford Grove region of Ilfraccob in Devon County, when he received shots in his chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the incident, which took place at 02:30 British Summer Ira, as a "incidental event".
The victim did not see the offender of the attack.
The injuries he suffered are not threatening his life and the police call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that injured the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, official sources said, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With the interruption of communications, humanitarian aid forces have failed to receive information from Dongala, a region in northern Palu, closer to the center of the 7.5-degree earthquake of Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were removed after the collapse of the disaster.
Here are some important elements about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit her.
Dongala is an anti-government that extends over 300 miles (180 miles) off the coast of Southwest Sulawesi Island.
The opposition, a degree of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main supports of the economy of the central Sulayese province, particularly in the magnificent region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it meets more in Moroway, on the coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Treatment Service.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit West Dongguan in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located within the earthquake of the Fire Ring in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most recent earthquakes and tsunami are the following:
2004: A large earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ashchev in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, while more than half of them were in Ashchev.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of May and early April.
Hundreds of deaths on the island of Nia, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake of the scale hit the southern part of Yava, Indonesia's largest island, causing tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6-degree earthquake of the Richter scale with a focus close to the city of Pantang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have been killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake of Richter's scale hit one of the islands of Mendoza near Sumatra, causing tsunami of 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost the lives of about 300 people.
2016: Low-deep restaurant earthquake hit the Penti Jaya area in Chech, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
It wasn't caused by tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed from buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island of Loboc in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily abandoned tourists.
Sarah Paelin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for an attack.
Palin, 29-year-old, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, prevention of domestic violence and resistance against the principle, according to a Saturday report published by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to accuse her crimes, she took her phone from hand.
Palin is temporarily held at the Mat-Su temporary reservation store, with a $500 warranty, according to the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent" when asked, as the network said.
Palin faces charges for three Class A floodings, which means that he can be charged with a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a class A flood, punishment for a single day jail and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time she's being prosecuted against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Paline, called the police to accuse the attack.
The case has now been filed before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, prevented a complaint about the crime of domestic violence and gun possession, while he was in a state of affairs.
His companion claimed that he got her on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behaviour with a traumatic anxiety disorder caused by his Iraqi service.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after an earthquake that hit the Suluway Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree scale earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The networks of electricity and communications have been interrupted, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit near the central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media media broadcast videos from the moment of the devastating event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a holiday on the beach in Palu when tsunami hit him on the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand the rarely imposed death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the imposition of death penalty to Shaiful Shaipof, the suspect for the terrorist attack in New York that cost eight people - a rare 19-conflict punishment imposed in the state for federals53.
Shaypof, 30, has been forced to use a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bicycle road along the West Side bus in the Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bicycles found on his road on October 31.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Shaipoff killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused severe physical injuries "intentionally" according to New Jersey's statement of intentional infringement of the death penalty.
Both of these charges refund the death penalty, according to the consignment.
Weeks after the attack, a federal swearing body brought Shaipof faced with the 22-point category, which included eight crime crime crimes, a criminal attack and a self-destructive tactic that is often applied by federal prosecutors in organized cases.
The attack required "significant design and prosecutor," the prosecutors said, describing the way Shaipof completed the attack as "arrogant, harsh and cruel."
"Saifulu Habibulavits Saipoff has caused pain, damage and loss in the families and friends of Diego Enrique Anhelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Lore Clives, Ann-Dreans, Representatives such as D.D.D.D., D.D.D., D.D.D., D.D.D., D.D.D., D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been decades since the last time the Southern Court of New York City has been prosecuted for a death penalty case.
The accused, Halid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but ultimately he was equivalent to voting in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was imposed for federal case in New York was in 1953 to the husbands Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being conspired for the execution of two chronic spying in the Soviet Union during the Ice Cream.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Shaipof, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared intact in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the respondents that he felt satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Shaypof told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the ISIS video attack he saw on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to police.
He declared innocent for the 22 charges listed in the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public advisors representing Shaipof, said he was "perhaps disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty instead of accepting the declaration of guilt for equilibrium with no possibility of evacuation will simply extend the injury caused by the facts to all involved," Paton said.
Shaypof’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
President of the Tory said Natezel Fartz should be headed for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faradge swore to "mobilize the people's army" today during a gathering of protests at the Tory Conference.
The former head of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians had to “feel pressure” by Eurosceptists, as one of the members of Teresa May said that he should be the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom had already "have gone out" until now if Farag was the prime minister for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in its efforts to calm down deeply divided Members was stressed by the fact that supporters of staying in the EU, Thoris, participated in a separate concentration of protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the compromise plan under control in amid attacks by Brexit allies, allies of staying in the EU and the EU.
Allieds continued to move forward with their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite reactions and force Eurosceptists and Workers to choose between their package and the "have".
Mr. Bowen said at the Leave Means Leave protest in Sullivan that he wanted to fly the "Checkers plan".
He said he had to be awarded a title of goodness to Mr Faraz and that he had been entitled to negotiations with Brussels.
“If we were the head, we would have already left now,” he said.
Wellingboro added: “I will support Brexit but we have to fly the Checkers plan.”
He expressed his opposition to the EU: "We have not fought in world wars to become subordinates.
We want to create our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wish to stay is totally real."
Toris Andrea Jenkins, Brexit MP, was also in the protest and said to journalists: “I am saying, ‘Premier, listen to the people.’
“The Checkers plan does not have the acceptance of the broad public, the Anti-opposition is not going to vote, does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who go down the streets and are elected below.
Please leave the Checkers plan and start listening."
With an urgent message to Mrs. May, he added: "The prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Faradge said at the protest concentration that politicians should be forced to “feel pressure” if they are preparing to forward the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“There is another issue of trust between us – the people – and the class of our politicians,” he said.
"They're going to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "we won't let you shine it if you do so."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are preparing to traile Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We’re launching the nation’s army that has given us victory with Brexit and we’ll never be calm until we become an independent, sovereign and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of their stay in the EU demonstrated in Birmingham before taking a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A few activists raised a pavement of Tory against Brexit after the group was concentrated this weekend.
Deputy of the Workers Lords Adonis defeated the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with an application of the party at the beginning of the meeting.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technologies needed for the EU-CAD Agreement, Canada with enrichment, for unprecedented borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's an absolute glass.
“It’s not a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider the possibility of applying for the presidency
U.S. Secretary-General Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider the possibility of applying for the presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats’ secretary spoke about its future plans during a concentration in a Western Massachusetts municipality on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, holds her re-election in November with the opponent of Republican State Representative Jeff Dyle, who joined the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is highly regarded to be dealt with with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters using the municipal structures since Trump’s mandate began.
One member of the conference asked her if she planned to apply for the presidency.
Warren said it was time to go to Washington to create our dissolved government and that means a woman must be at the top.
Detention for the fatal shooting of LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rose, Los Angeles, announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of LSU's catball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Buton Rose's police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyton Simpson in a press interview at 11:00 p.m. (Austral Zone Iras).
They published a shooting video on Friday, asking for help to recognize the man who appeared on the video.
The 20-year-old Smith was shot deadly in the Southern University area early Friday.
"Wade Smith suffered injury from a ball injury in his head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, according to the 247sports website network.
Wade attacked to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Sibson responded and admitted that he was found at the point in possession of his gun and confessed that he shot Wade Sims.
Simson was arrested without resisting and held in the Police Department of the East Baton Rouz neighborhood.
Thirteen-year-old SIMMS, who grew up at Bathon Rose, played 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a main player last season, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 ribauts per match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is heading for a global title, as his team's instructions gave hand over Sebastian Fedel
It was clear since Walthery Booth passed in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's commands would play an important role in the match.
Butt had a good start and almost cried Hamilton as he defended his position at the first two spins and invited Fedel to attack his hometown.
Fedel first went to the kitchen and let Hamilton run in the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the kitchen a round later and went out behind Feel, but Hamilton went out ahead after a wheel fight, which forced Ferrari’s driver to leave the interior unwillingly due to the risk of falling into the breach of the double motion to defend the third race.
Max Ferstappen began with the last position and was seventh at the end of his first round of 21th birthday.
He then remained first for a large part of the game, as he held his tires with the goal of ending quickly and passing ahead of Kimmy Raiconen in fourth place.
He finally went to the kitchen in the 44th round, but couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Raiconen arrived in the fourth.
It's a hard day because Waltery was fantasy all weekend and he was a real master who let me pass.
The team took them outstanding and did one-two,” Hamilton said.
The body's language was very bad.
President Donald Trump slaughtered Secretary-General Diane Finstein on Saturday for his perseverance that he did not pass through the letter of Christian Blazi Ford, to which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Court of Bret-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Ba
Speaking at a concentration in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the report made by Ford before the Committee on Dispositional Affairs of the Mayor, commenting instead that the statements in the Mayor proved that people are "free and unfaithful."
“The only thing that could happen is that beautiful thing that is happening in the last days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and stubborn and foolish and liars,” he said.
"When you see posts and breaks and then you say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, you did the escape?
Remember her answer... you broke the document - "oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't go through it."
Well, half a minute.
If we collapsed...No, we didn't collapse," he added.
Finstein received the letter of Ford containing details on the charges against Kavano in July and she passed earlier in September - but Finstein refused that the escape was made from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't pass her story," Finnstein told the committee, according to Hill's newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it confident and I kept it confident as he asked me."
But her rejection seemed not to be particularly convinced by the president, who commented during the Saturday concentration: "I'll tell you something, the body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the applicant for the Supreme Court, which was accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president allowed to mean that the Democrats used the charges to serve their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power using any necessary means.
You see abuse, abuse, no matter who they are injuring, who they have to walk to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite Lig: Daddy Stars 5-3 Belfast Jainds
Patrick Davier puts two goals for Jayards against Daddy
Daddy Stars received an excuse for her defeat in the Friday match of Elite Lig from Belfast Jaiads, winning the 5-3 rival in Daddy on Saturday.
The Jayards got an easy walk with two goals with Patrick Davier's and Francis Boyer's hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cuney brought the equation for the landlords before Dawyer regain the Jayards.
François Buzar balanced for Daddy and then two goals by Luke Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat in Elite League in the season for Adam Kif's men, who came with a 2-1 score on Daddy in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, with the Jayards to win in the three previous matches.
Dawyer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFul's assistant, while David Radford gave the assistant thanks to Bowieer doubled the progress four minutes later.
In an innertiary period full of action, Sullivan put the flooring team again in the game at 13:10 before Matthew Markuard gave the assistant for the equilibrium from Cunei at 15:16.
Dawyer secured the predecessor for the Jayards in the first half-year-old when he reached his second goal for the evening at the end of the first season.
The group of landlords was rebuilt and Buzar again compared with a power show goal at 27:37.
Cunei and Charles Corcoran joined their forces to help Nielsen give the progress to Dadi for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the last period.
The Jayards, who have now lost four of the last five matches, are playing at their seat with Milton Cains in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to kill hundreds of airplane passengers from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero as he has lost his life in his attempt to ensure the safe departure of an aircraft transported by hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many were ignored due to a large earthquake that hit the island of Sulayesi on Friday, causing tsunami.
Strong transfers continue to injure the region and many have been captured in crashes in the city of Palu.
However, although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Guwan Agund refused to leave his position in the control tower that was manipulated, at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to make sure the flight 6321 of the airline Batik Air, which was at the time on the departure route, could be departing safely.
Then he drove out of the control tower when he thought he had fallen.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokeswoman Johannes Sierra said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News television network.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikophan in Calimantan to bring him to a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We're shocked with his death," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the country's catastrophe treatment service reports that access to cities of Donggula, Sigi and Botswana is limited.
"The number of dead is believed to rise more, as many bodies are still under the ruins, while many of them have not been able to reach," said the service spokesman, Sutopo Purguo Nugrocho.
Waves reaching six meters destroyed Palu, which will hold a massive cemetery on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing assistance and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carrier brings bodies.
Clean water is little.
"Mini markets are shielded everywhere."
Jean-Gelfad, President of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is striving to save survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vindondo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you to work nightly to carry out any work related to exile.
Are you ready?" said the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Loboc, which cost more than 550 lives.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini says a man is ignored after a jet in the lake
The airline flying to a Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now reports that a man is ignored, while earlier it said that both 47 passengers and crew members had securely discharged the flying aircraft.
Air Niugini said it was unable to find the traces of a man from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said he was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to identify the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information on passengers, such as its age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuk Island airport.
The authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and the status of all of them was stable.
The causes of conflict and the exact interference of the events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was attacked on the sea outside of the landing route.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had reached the landing route.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane had fallen very low.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others were able to walk through the water that reached them in the middle of the emergency escape of the deep-season plane.
He said the air strikes had panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered mild injury in his head.
The U.S. Navy said some sailors working nearby to improve a debris were also helping rescue using a firearm boat to carry people to the coast before the ship climbing at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Security Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airlines’ conflicts registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of these conflicts.
Analyst presents the timetable of the night that a woman burned alive
The accused authority completed its purchase on Saturday in a repeated trial of a man accused of burning a live woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice ministry analyst Paul Roulette has set for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He swears how he used cell phone files to set the movements of the 29-year-old accused Queenton Finals and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Champers, at the night of her death.
Roulette said he had received location files from various mobile phones showing that Teresa was with Chambers the evening of her death, voting his previous claims, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was with the Chambers phone during the time he claimed he was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford put him as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the accused authority asked him if Teresa was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He lied because my truck was in Nasville."
Another objection was that Teresa said he knew Champers about two weeks before her death.
The mobile files showed that they knew only a week.
Roulette said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Teresa wrote Chambers' messages, calls, and communications from his phone.
"He wrote it out of his life," said Hale.
The defence will start its purchase on Sunday.
The judge said he estimates that later that day the trial will be placed in the judgment of the oaths.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to question the negative view of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip-hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and social issues.
They want to return to his roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common experience a recent recovery in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
And another black man?
Dada in New York sends a couple who dismissed her after receiving a "racial" message
A New York-wide dictator has been prosecuting a pair of racist dismissal after receiving a message wrongly sent by her mother where the latter was complaining that the dictator was "other a black man."
The couple refuses to be racists, comparing the treatment with "excitation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that her new girlfriend Jesse Morris was black, just when she appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"THIRD THIRD OTHER MYROS," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Moris and even twice.
Once she realized her gaffee, Mr. Plasco-Flaxman now dismissed Mr. Moris, stating that their coming netanya, who was an African-American, had not done any good work and waited for a Philippine Post, according to New York.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for her one and unique working day and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Moris filed proceedings against the couple asking for compensation for dismissal and pledge for compensation of $350 per day for the six-month duration of work as an internal wallet, for which she was originally hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he said to the Post on Friday, while he added, "I know it's a discriminatory treatment."
The couple resists claims that they are racists, saying it was reasonable to release Moris, as they feared that they could not trust her again after they attacked her.
"My husband sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said his wife Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even in error?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
Similar to the treatment with "exclamation," Plasco said his wife had just been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Have you hunted someone in this situation?
“It’s not so kind,” said the banking investor.
While the legal case is evolving, the court of public opinion has hurried to condemn the couple on social media, evaluating them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not be interested in a bear speaking, as reveals a new letter.
Bont’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into the position of someone who read it for the first time before his release.
It’s a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the huge success of Pundington.”
She said her father, who worked as an iconist at the BBC before she was inspired to write the child's book from a loud bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "small," as her father fled from life.
About Pandington, who describes him as a "very important member of the family", he added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't overwhelming," he said.
“But because Pandington was so true in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who can do something: you’re proud of it, even if it’s not yours in reality.
I think that's how he saw Pundington's success.
Although it was his own creation and his imagination, he always gave the nature to Pandington himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her from the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was transferred to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried foolishly to save her life.
"Nand was calling and told me that it was very bad, that he had no many hopes to do so," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
“Once, Nade called me to tell me he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Taxi, I love you too much, my dear.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs given to her to keep her heart alive were slowly decayed, and they came out of her body.
He had already died a few hours ago and at that time, and now everything was lost.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't cry, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay cold."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far mourned for the loss of her daughter, has passed on to the plane with other passengers, who ignored the trial he was going through.
"No one knew it," he said.
“I had my head down and they ran tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was in the plane, a feeling of compassion for Nate dominated me.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who perish the loss of their own faces climb cards on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones of suicide are trying to prevent other people from removing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey hang on a bridge of Wales cards with psychiatric messages and phone numbers that can be called to receive support.
Mr. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lindney, said that her son was a very promising boss, with a translating smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted the room.”
However, he left his job before he died, as "he was in a very bad situation."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after putting his life to an end.
Mr. Davis said, "I am worried that there will be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards to inform the world that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphrey, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt stunned or sad or something like that," he said.
“Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had taken the whole Christmas day – when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t look at them.”
He said his death caused them a huge injury, but they have to overcome it: "He's driving the family.
He's gonna fuck us.
But we all have to continue and fight.”

Bret Cavano's future is uncertain as the FBI starts research
"I thought that if we could actually succeed in something like what he wanted - a limited duration and limited object investigation - we might be able to bring a bit of unity," Felix said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved in a trap of partial insolvency.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness is entirely due to time convergence.
The interim elections are only five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans are not going well, they will significantly weaken their efforts to achieve the person they wish to choose in the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush calls Secretarys, pushing them to support Mr. Cavano, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through this he met his wife Asley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI's report is released?
Voting will be held in the General Assembly, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavano can take at least 50 votes in the General Assembly, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels falls under Kim’s power
The number of North Koreans to South Koreans has declined since Kim Jong-un became a member of power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, providing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said 1,127 distances were observed last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the highest fees of displaced persons were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
In the overwhelming majority of North Koreans, South Korean citizenship is finally offered.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the borders illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross them than the heavy-protected Destroyed Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers remote illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often enjoys them through violence.
The relationships between North and South Korea, which are typically still in war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to talk about negotiations on denuclearization, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate with broad terms to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Reim Jong Ill accused the U.S. sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, in no way we will attack our country unilaterally first," Mr. Rim said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Cavano "hysterical", says it is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic Chairman of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelozi called the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, "hysterical" and said it was by itself inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelozie made these comments at an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Estonia, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman was behaved in this way, they would call her "hysterical"," Pelozzi commented on the Cavana's statement to the General Committee on Disease on Thursday.
Cabano, with intense excitement, refused the charges that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christian Blazi Ford when both teenagers were.
During his incarceration, Kavano was deeply excited, sometimes he almost shouted and his voice shouted as he was talking about his family and his school years.
He also convicted the Democrats in the committee, designating his accusations against him as a "terroristic and coordinated political murder" organized by liberals who have been angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozie said she believes that Kavano's statement proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as she proved that he was predetermined against the Democrats.
"I think that he has deleted himself with these statements and the way he has succeeded against Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozi responded when asked whether he would attempt to blame Kavano if his appointment was confirmed and whether Democrats would gain the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say that - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then it's not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he serves at the moment," Pelozzi said.
Kavano is a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Regional Court of Columbia).
Pelozy added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavano on the Affordable Care Act or in the Roy v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In hearings on the confirmation of his appointment, Kavano refused to answer questions if he would allow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Isn't it time to go to court a hysterical, predestinated man and wait to say, "Isn't it wonderful?" she said.
Women must have it in their own possession.
It is a justified breakthrough, months and years of anger blowing out and can't get it out of it without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," said Mrs. Stephen 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, right?"
He continued to say, "A woman who was an elder somewhere, who said she was crying when she was smoking, but she had developed a technique according to which when she was smoking and began to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, "Can you think I'm tired of?
I'm angry."
And that's just how it continued.
And it seemed great to me."
Tears are allowed as a breakthrough of anger in part because they are basically inserted.
One of my strongest memories from a work I had done before, in a office where men were dominating, is once I wept with an unexpected anger and took me from the sword a bigger woman - a cold director I was always scared - and moved me to a ship.
"Don't let them ever see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've broken you."
Patricia Srender, then Democratic Secretary of Colorado, had collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested to have had an outsourcing relationship on a ship called Monkey Business and left the race humble, Mrs. Srender, deeply disappointed to see the idea of being overwhelmed, thought that there was no reason for six months to
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he laughed, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the course, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone characterized the situation as "Snow and the Seven Nanos."
Because the campaign had already begun for a long time, it was back in funding and so it swore it would not come into the election course if it hadn't collected $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that it would not start an official campaign, she was very intensely loaded with emotions - grateful to the people who supported her, disappointing with the system that made it so difficult to collect money in the mind and targeting voters instead of the lover and representative.
"You thought I had a nervous cloning," Mrs. Srender remembers the reactions of the guy against her.
“You would think Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my cemetery?
"Cracked"?
How the U.S.-China trade war can do good in Beijing
The greetings of the trade war between the United States and China were exaggerating and while the battle still has a lot to end, a collapse between the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump dropped the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exporting products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest climb evolved this week, imposing new tariffs of $200 million ($150 million) in essence by taxing half of all products imported into the United States from China.
Beijing returns fires to species every time, while it has recently imposed duties of five to ten percent in goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to repay the U.S. fires and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to put it down soon.
In order to manage Washington to resign, it must give in to their demands, but worshiping publicly in the United States would be too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing could play its papers correctly, U.S. pressures in the context of the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a critical political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create economic collapse conditions in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have admitted in the past."
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the refugee return and calls for help to rebuild the damaged seven-year (and now) country war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wailed al-Mualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now fulfilled for the ultimate return of refugees to the country who were forced to resign due to terrorism and the unilateral financial measures that had affected their daily life and biosphere.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war ended in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Muhammed said the Syrian government welcomed help to rebuild the damaged country.
However, he stressed that aid will not be accepted under conditions or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe locks victory at Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the Rider Cup 2018, winning the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 on Le Golf National golf course outside Paris in France.
The U.S. team has been defeated six times on European ground and has won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the first position, as Danish leader Thomas Byron's team reached the 14.5 degrees needed to defeat the United States.
The U.S. team's star Phil Michaelston, who fought hard during the longest tournament, threw his shot in water at the 16th hole of par-3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari received all of his rounds and became one of the four players who hit 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spitch was defeated at 5&4 by the lowest in the European team's player ranking, Dano Thorbourne Olsen.
The best-rated player in the world, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 against Ian Pauler from England, who could play his last game at the Knight Cup.
The Spanish veteran of eight Render Cups, Sergio Garcia, was the most victorious European of all seasons in the tournament with a total of 25.5.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t keep it.
It was a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy that we got the cup back.
"It's all about the team and I'm glad I could help," Garcia, excited after European victory, said.
He puts the shadow to his companion John Ram, who won the U.S. legend of Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride that I won Tiger Woods, grew up admiring this guy," said 23-year-old Rama.
Woods also lost in his four matches in France and now has a record career in the Rider Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all ages, who has won 14 major titles and has only overcome him by Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. team has been difficult to find a goal all weekends, except Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American Chief Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
Some moments this morning we have pushed Europe a lot.
We struggled hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big boss.
And the 12 players played very well.
We're going to reintegrate, work with the U.S. PGA and the Copenhagen Raider Commission, and we're going forward.
I love these 12 kids and I am proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us.”
