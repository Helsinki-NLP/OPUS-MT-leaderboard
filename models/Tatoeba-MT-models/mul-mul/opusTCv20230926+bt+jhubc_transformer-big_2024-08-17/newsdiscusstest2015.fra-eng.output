UKIP residents who refuse to live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not serve to pay for those who come to the UK to make health tourism, and when, with this in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people with HIV are included in unwanted.
First, you use special arguments, and then you discredit them by a hardly screwed homophobia.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to make the coat behind chronic hypochondrial intolerances who think everything is theirs.
I think you are using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wings, does not exist virtually.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So nobody would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch is not a proof.
Yes, then shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, he just made it comment.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be fired for spreading such a populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase is a lot of surprise, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He has absolutely not made any homophobic comments.
You will need to be able to give it back.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely spoken because, unlike Farage and his thick disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own incapacity to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation is as bitter in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the austerity period will have nothing arranged.
Hoping about 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's 'TIGRE OF EUROPE' was advantageous, a few years ago.
We've seen the next!
This begins to read the article.
We try to make it believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ‘new miraculous economics’ is happening.
With the Brussels Agreement, impotents on the lowest companies in Europe, a triple work path, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients, nothing of what to 'pavoize' for the moment with the coming of the Polish.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is on the occasion of recent events.
The lowest income rate in Europe?
It's fake!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France from the policies on real impotence paid by multinationals.
If a report was released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full money.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become enormous, and there are new cars (and cars) in all corners of the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I’ve lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery has been evident in the daily bubbles since the return.
Is it supposed to be of economic actuality?
Don’t worry, I’m sure the comments will soon be inflamed.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a sticking on the A140.
Is Ryanair now intending to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few pockets and rails on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That's what I say I'll steal with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once refined.
That would be the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair make passengers pay an extra fee for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish companies, you couldn't let yourself go on vacation, young man
I never picked up Ryanair and the last 3 times I picked up the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it’s Ryanair, so they can give them joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff only have to take it on themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to the incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and if it is necessary to compensate the passengers and, if so, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error from the airport controllers.
Passengers were placed on another plane in less than an hour, they have no right to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome to this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Burgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and is literally great of the world.
People do not come mass for the quality of restaurants (some, mostly) or for the Watchtower Hall at the White-Manteaux Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly pushy).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly alive and animated.
With a lot of foreigners spending . . .
Do you think Sunday’s opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, beaten around the world with 50% of tourists.
@Aloes Fake!
The only argument that I would seem acceptable is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in tax.
Tourist areas lose a significant volume of revenue every year for the same reasons.
Stay the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right for employees, except for exceptions.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the work code.
Neither the Minister of Economy nor, on the other hand, the Minister of Foreign Affairs have the minimum competence to reform the labour code.
While they blow it up.
What does the law use to do?
To satisfy some of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday am I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is opened 4 days per week but not we!
This is the access to culture...
And that’s also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with strength against fascism
the way of life he defended with strength against fascism and Bolshevism
What if her daughter's inheritance, against her will, was used to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are fine, others are not terrible.
Without a doubt his success would like his part of the cake, if you give me the expression.
His preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its fascist ideas together, and also added his well-known hatred to Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I'm not.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he headed the other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a "deal" with the Nazis and he was very skilled to win.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he joined the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium, and finally the whole world, can thank God for having had in these five years, just in these five years, Churchill at the bar and no one else.
Churchill's size has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sell paintings on the free market to collect money from the inheritance fees, they could even make profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they should gather the money to buy it.
It's just as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the time of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
The renewal of the internal market by public work will only favor large companies, which will increase their dividend by avoiding hiring, while infrastructure factories are by definition unrenovable.
As regards the social reforms recommended by the Minister, they reflect the true franchise of uncertainty towards dialogue.
Return to Princeps values.
The reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
We either solidarously come to his help, or he has a right in exchange for the services he makes or has made at a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also a dancer who lives in revenue from his property.
It is necessary to distinguish the one investing for a return at the time of his retirement and the one living from his interests.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above is vice
The small engineering of the finance lacks unique imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is therefore marginal in nothing a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the issue of decline emerges in response to a recession that is just a brutal wild decline
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of bars, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harder, then the need for investment is shouting: isolation, rail network renovation, urban transportation, transportation and energy storage etc.
A tax that promotes high income and income.
Who's in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung’s profits are damaged by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of bigger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have deceived buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for the benefit of Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft established this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underlying philosophy and I love design.
Some people don’t attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and prize.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a better platform.
Is there “a better car manufacturer,” not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a growing portable industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It is healthier and must be encouraged.
That’s what’s in our interest to everyone.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it’s not an Apple product, even if I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (although on the opposite side of the Parisean fools) could tell us what the author(s) they fight ideas about the gender and indicate the works they hear rightly fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in The Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I love you well, and you are someone intelligent and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, a closer approach that didn't come to me (I don't have her lifestyle).
Otherwise, as you return to it, this subject is not interested in me, and sincerely I don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends could get out of my retreat, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, that is.
Who is afraid of the world?
But what are those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat cutter.
We see how much these studies affect the most intimate at home.
Of course, we are no longer in the idea debate.
It's another thing, much deeper.
Have you read, Jean, that the World published an article on the need for theology?
@: When it comes to an idea debate, I thought it should go to the sources.
To claim to fight ideas from the only exhibit that their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very strict to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it is the whole difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that he understands the nuance.
I haven't read Judith, the very symbolic throat cutter, I was satisfied with the "Second sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I looked at the clip from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon shortly appeared when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated for a little disappointment of having sometimes the view blocked by the clouds.
It was great here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really swallow the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
A special flash of blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will make him his true color as soon as possible.
It's obsessed with you, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the rainfall of the Perseides meteors and for almost all important astronomical phenomena of the last few years.
I begin to think there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for a observatory, even though things greatly improved on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods from 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds above the valley of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a taxi on this eclipse.
Whoever looks at this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will you be obsessed when it ends with disappearance?
It seems you’ve spent a lot of time reading discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government to accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Great photo of the moon above the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
It looks like Mars is going to collapse with Earth!
Nothing about stock exchange and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequality between income and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is about to kill Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these preconditions are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Go see the results of the miracle revenue on Tuesday 15 October: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece, the stock exchange collapses.
However, this seems to be the examples to follow.
The notar reform would generate a request for compensation of €8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy states that these compensation requests are not based.
What if there is a mistake in the Ministry of Economics?
Will the decision-makers who have undermined the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notars have the same courage when the bill is presented to the state budget?
The next in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
@lol The State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget as the State's temporary horizon is theoretically infinite while that of the household is bored by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is unproductive, these contribute to the financing of material and immature investments from future growth and thus future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the benefits of the world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
Beautiful theory of complot.
Unfortunately, the truth does not correspond to your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by law as written by politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drugs rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to enjoy the incult masses.
In fact, doctors don’t make money with the drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don’t make money with drugs Because Liberals want our health system to look like that in the United States, you should know how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are shortened in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrongly formulated to blame the tuubs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the profits of businesses and “research”.
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditure and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of drugs available everywhere, as well as the differences from country to country on what is for free or only on prescription.
This is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific, direct or indirect process.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that break them up and the costly necessary permits.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy with the use of alternatives such as marijuana, those who reach a version offering good quality products at well-known doses will benefit largely.
I'm sorry to tell you Madam, but you're wrong, there's a lot of things happening in the coulisses for doctors and pharmacies.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone puts the shot in the ears of a hospital officer.
You can’t have patents on herbs...
If social science researchers were doing research instead of making politics and networking, they could be using their “works.”
A researcher does not compare one fact to another.
Comparison is not searching.
Comparison is doing pedagogy not research.
You can’t say, “The search is accomplished, we have to apply it” and then in the same jet, “we have to experiment with everything good.”
If your research is done, why do you experiment?
If your research is not done, why do you ask us to apply them?
Is it possible to explain how a “scientist” can deduce that a student who can’t assimilate mathematics alone could easily assimilate mathematics and other matters?
New technologies allow you to learn under the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they don’t know how to learn?
Pis tests are only one indicator we do a indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfying to us.
What is the use of building an indicator that tells you what you arrange, a self-promoting will, a fraud?
One way to train teachers is to distance sophists and ideologists from training and that the practitioners teach the practitioners.
factory read the paragraph on the stages (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion drives us to the most inefficient conservatism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of existing practices, and that does not allow the system to progress " .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their entire place in a modern training of teachers.
Theoretics of education should not have any place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put the foot in an operational block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of educational problems.
To give more weight to theories of education, it would definitively destroy it.
Your analogy is totally fair: if I wouldn’t want to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the taste.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Deputy responsible for the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why didn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you for the former MDR.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating the copyright, it will be enough to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright violation = stealing.
This is the same because they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license does not cost anything.
No, it is a copyright violation.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having adequate license, you deprive artists of their winning bread.
You can always discuss pedant hypotheses - but it's the flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it will not be true.
It is an infringement of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of breaching copyright
Obviously, it doesn’t bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, a almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, so I am happy to withdraw them from this fictional income.
The lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have passed with one click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their mp3 rider with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
If we could export this resource that we fill up, the rider who says everything is wrong.
If it is a PS Member who claims it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they're at age to choose, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France shoots people down and helps them constantly.
I don’t want my children to support the debt that this policy will create.
What pulls France down, these are speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in a private business since.
I had the chance to work in businesses led by excellent business managers: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am employed because I know I don’t have the skills to manage a business and this choice allows me to shoot red ballots on the null patterns I often meet.
In my baskets, I fully share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders are constantly citing to ask for reforms in France, Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, particularly by ensuring the link between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises - What are the French patrons expecting to do so??
What does the state hold on to them?
The state that they accuse of empire?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-company company managers on your part!
Remember that you created you as a job, as a value added, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an insolvency problem: the incompetence of French business leaders to create jobs that are building and mining while waiting for the permanent assistant of the State!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to claim the reduction of wages otherwise their removal!
I look forward to seeing all "negative" comments on this topic.
It is ironic to see how people always complain about First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves floating rather than transforming themselves.
This does not mean that Scotland’s railroads have not improved since Last took care of it.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don’t have the power to do that.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't.
Well, the work will get us bored, isn't it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and participating in tender calls.
But it seems that we aren’t very good in management, most of our privated services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision is finally cancelled.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they have repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for joint venture and sharing, and believes that all workers should contribute beyond the borders.
So you can assume that you will be happy with this decision;)
This may be because the management of the Dutch is on good rail while the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a proprietary change, but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least wrong choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchise system.
"It was a fighting girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate this kind of expression.
Suppose being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact that being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancers that are not less dead, I know palms.
Get out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again, too.
I don't tell you that it's the condition to manage, I tell you that it helps.
Nothing to do with anything worth it...!
When in the examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Insinuating, would it be just a moment, that we may have the merit to get out of a sickness or that we may deter not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves from everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, do you have a wave idea of what C?
Unfortunately, thinking the opposite, if, having a solid moral, probably allows to accept more easily heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not reject them by fear.
Someone who is struggling in medicine is, first of all, someone who trusts medicine.
But if you prefer to return to “the Lord” it’s another thing.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations belong to moralists.
When you catch a shit, a real girl, you make yourself shit to become a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirty, big, and if I've been "beat" as these psychologists say, it's completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of scratching the teeth, suffering the hell, and crashing the strikes.
I thought the accusation against Milosevic had been decided and completed a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's up? What's up?
It's a birthday.
A Forgotten Birthday.
His trial was conducted “speakly” and then scanned under the cover.
Is this the story we told at that time?
The Communist became a nationalist who launched three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what is left on the side: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MINDRE rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way to get out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the west compressor roller.
The Westers used a smoke screen to remove a part of a sovereign state which later unilaterally declared its independence and was soon recognized by the Western States who then finally lied about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (etnic purification).
Vojislav Kostunica, which is mentioned here, died politically after his first mandate for not being able to understand the situation that had evolved.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyran (even if we didn’t like it).
In my knowledge, there is only a method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works approximately, measuring the pedezoelectric level in the quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
A hope so but caution is putting This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located at about 124 light years of Earth in the Cygnus constellation which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules” , according to a study by Dr.
The method to follow.
Like those that involve animals that feel a threat will happen.
Thanks to the Pastor of Science for regularing us, often, for these experimental proofs that are carried out in the world.
How do animals know (in advance)?
Without a doubt the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the case of earthquake.
Like the radon, for example.
A priori inodorable gas for humans, but maybe deceived by animals.
All these methods are indetectable for man, but not for the measurement instruments he has.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art reporting relating to the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that led to the sensitivity of animals to earthquake magnetic fields, and especially their changes before an earthquake.
Well, I'm not scientific, but their assumptions had convinced me!
Or are we on these researches?
Why is so much disrespect to this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If you examine things quietly and strictly, you publish it in a serious magazine, and no one ignores it.
As soon as we talk about “signs” given by animals, we hit the same way: everyone will remember that five minutes before a earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did it too much as Mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't stop thinking that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's always trying to diverge with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari’s representative asked him what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to elect himself as mayor and he did not hold one.
It's just pointing out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a fucking crap, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it is a celebrity and people have inculcated the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rate of the Tories will cover the ceiling I'm sure.
God helps us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be a
That's exactly what the Londonians were saying.
He should have brought his friend the parpaing with him, smarter than he
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French were really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all who have given themselves the penate to read a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “white iron” speak as sadly as the dead who stayed there.
We understand that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there at the bottom since the Battle of Savo) did not want to go back there.
We actually summed up in front of the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is at the end.
That's the little ones.
But the eco is a total smoking.
Calculate the kerosene consumes to achieve the goal completely decredibilizing the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors that are philanthropists.
There is no more com operation, nor has it done.
The cow, it gives a lot of desire!!!
I'm looking forward to the web series with impatience!
Your recite makes me review, identifying me a little bit in the passage (I also learned how to navigate with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the White Moulin in Brest rade!).
Chapel also for ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and be proud to show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public agencies should not in any way devote a sum of our taxes to finance the dreams of some even as friendly adventurers as those there!
Are there players in current Serbian training that are of Kosovo origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at the Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are of Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team.
It's Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the midfield or before in the 1970s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where it is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez, who, under the headquarters of legendary Suleman Rebac, ended twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also counted points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful Arsène Boro Wenger crew).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said he was going to become a big player when he was at the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener, and as far as I know there's no owner there.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which covers all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there wasn't too much damage (what I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map, not what is called Great Albania, but Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the country's ends to the neighbouring countries.
How can we feel a "explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are indoors?
How is it???
What makes me a little worried in this “testification” is that the only fact that I could, once, spontaneously rejoice over the terrible death of thousands of people, witnesses in my eyes a “border line” personality of which all “testifications” should be taken with the greatest inspection.
Without a doubt, in the short time of “today,” we would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that, once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalypticly harm the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims ruined by their feelings of humiliation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classical harmful pleasure.
We had a little doubt about it.
The Western "Christian/White/Galuis" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when considering the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the today’s Arab world.
I'm talking about Cairo or Algeria faubourgs, not towers of Dubai.
The glorious past, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this devil’s tone?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irriguent the Arab world l: bigot conservatism of powers in place and nihilism fascist.
The common point, the gel of thought and excommunication (due or armed) of its critical expression.
If we had known it before, we shouldn’t make the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in the UK, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, moist and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone is sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in the UK, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath in the autumn.
Not so much to cut the breath as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being at the point of dying.
In the UK, if you are lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've been a nice summer this year, don't make your grinched clips!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to the outermost germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle.
A wonderful step full of inviting smells, with a fever that culminates with celebrations such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the audit of the increases for children, the amount incurred by the State is essentially derived from decisions 8 to 10 .
However , as regards the number of households who have seen their tax increases as a result of this measure , these are especially the decisions 4 and 5 that are concerned (median income ) , as set out in Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of the part concerning most of the widows is not treated at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and underunderstands it is painless.
And he's not ready to arrange.
Well, we're not on the pail, but dreamers.
Once the PS makes a policy rather left, we won’t cry...
It is obvious that those who are part of the 20% richest must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s continue and encourage these 20% to work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Live the Trots and ICI recycled at PS: they understand everything.
Adam, you're wrong with what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of wealth.
A fair tax is when it bans anyone to collect as much as he can.
In addition to a certain limit, money loses all its utility.
And once the profitability of money is over, money is only used to make money, that is, to make the most misfortune.
We are one of the 20% richest.
Of course also 20% of households who work most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so much lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopias of the red khmer head cutters have lived fortunately.
I have made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves at the reception or face the least tracas.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, stay behind and leave.
This will be my first option when I’m travelling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6:00 too late.
I like Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky.” No, it’s not true.
You just missed luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change the locks, taken measures to spend a week to the hotel and transfer $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article cite Teman complain that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
J'ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to calm down.
I’m looking to pay a deposit and a month to rent at once but I’m a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard about.
But where are you going?
“Support the troops,” the Bu$herie sang on all tons...
Inoffensive weapons.
I am sure that this will enjoy the families and close to thousands of Kurdish dead in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
In addition, what would this mass crime in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still useful?
It is not hyper clear the author’s style: “Asking weapons of mass destruction.
We're all right. We're all right.
You think it’s time to weaken the army to strengthen education
It is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war.
Alternative: Is it time to strengthen education because we are still in war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if “they” were working 35 hours instead of 17 hours.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this can’t be seen because National Education does not have the means of providing a college/school office to its teachers, so they work at their home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay either the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
In addition, it’s so much the board at 17:00 a week and 4 months of holiday that you can’t fill the CAPES of maths, come, we’re waiting for you.
How do you don't want to grow up badly educated chickens whose parents scare you by treating you as a bracelet?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarma the Jihads so that the population of the Kurds can grow better.
Where you can see that the Bush administration has absolutely done everything through.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, to earn three times nothing, and yet it was a job for which it needed a diploma.
A year later, I saw an advertisement to be working for the London Metro, it was paid £5,000 more per year and we didn’t even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don’t do it if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something that’s paid well, or you like to do it.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still pay my student loan.
I don’t like business work so I hope it’s going to end either in public office or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I got my degree in 2011, there was already a three-year retreat.
The best way to reduce the number of graduates without employment?
To get rid of biusonours lines such as art / letters / theater / media / philosophy / political science, i.e. what we call the degrees of unemployed.
I have one of these degrees and I finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma, but, as said above, a good professional journey, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting wage was lower but we quickly rise the levels because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate of engineering studies / artistic lines has lasted for years.
Scientists can’t solve all problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work in time and interact with people in a way to get results.
Are letters, philosophy, and art biunumers?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about the genre degrees of media study or whatever the absconce branch where you went.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the major issues to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and emphasize them.
Wouldn’t it be better for a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I badly see the inhabitants of the end-of-the-fountain of Essonne and Val-d'Oise doing 80km-return every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and the small belt residents already have many more convenient public transport means otherwise (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secured and key-closed parks, as they already exist in northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalised by the 2RMs.
Initially, we hope the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Take advantage of their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found any room for a SUL bike sticker.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding a office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When discussed with pedestrians and other users of the common transport reasons, they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these baths, these scooters that driven super fast and rolling off the motorcycle system codgno speed itself survival 2/ we take the motorcycles full of pollution in the head (which the motorcycles are codable).
The cycling tracks are from apartheid, you need to cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of velo moves is ridiculous.
I begin to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the milk.
In addition to what OR reports, EELV deputy members seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it is better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: This is not Russia.
I'm not sure you love how the world evolves.
That looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to the ECHR, but I did not hear saying that a complaint had actually been filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be resumed while waiting for the result of the investigation report on the accident and the criminal investigation resulting from that.
Yes, but Libya did not explode Pan Am 103 as well.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, it is the fault of the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot before, Ukraine launched in the area of air attacks on rebels and any plane could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions because of an obvious threat or has he chosen to play with the lives of innocent so that airlines pay overflow rights?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurpating government / the ultra-nationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate wholesale that Putin has shot the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
Previous: A 1986 judgment by the International Court of Justice concluded that the provision of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this case go to the CIJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can submit evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything about it.
Calling Ricardo and being such a zoo in the eco, it's sad!
It is called Polaire to lose the north is happy.
One animal question: Is the poor of today more poor than the poor of yesterday?
I can't worry about noting that those who most virulously criticize Piketty's book haven't read it!
It’s easy to read, I spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of production-income, capital-income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour-income, capital property, merit and inheritance in the long term log.
It shows that today’s capital concentration joins that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that the two world wars have lowered the capital concentration, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You see no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has some limits.
Then, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, we can discuss this without having read the book of which the main thing is to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent to read it?
Is the central thesis of its pavement summary of the press false?
I didn't read and I didn't read it.
So I rely on the summary of its central thesis, and that is what I think is pure fumistry.
The notion of divergence between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Wasn't humanity enriched globally?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is today's real political issue.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without doubt.
But remember that she is only 17 years old.
A age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden for the young girl and she will find her way to live a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adaptation that colored pervers are incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a bit strange.
She thanked her father for giving him a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she had not been where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years old.
Is Malala herself not part of these “colored pervers”?
You should not have any “antenny time” on this site.
You are, yourself, a terrible pervers.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, his father wasn't going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when they shot him.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equality of women’s rights.
He is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and for her to have the right to decide her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl should often marry at the age of 14 without having a word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it loudly enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years old.
Rather disappointed by this season 4 entry, and especially by Jessica Lange, who apparently has a bit of difficulty to find her Marlene Dietrich's soci character.
I just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
The first fascinating episode.
The performance is close to perfection and the show by Jessica Lange singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply reversing.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have all of a sudden watching 13 episodes in 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is that, apart from Jessica Lange’s extraordinary, it’s especially the risks of putting in scenes and mountings sitting on me.
AHS has an avalanche of original plans that does not mislead the adoption of today’s productions.
I'm a little far away from seeing you throwing the bowl in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to stir the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say so well, there are many other things yet.
It is not just for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And well, I look a lot at her.
Then I find the series sinning by writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I can't see them doing 10 American Horror Story seasons or it's gonna end like 24 hours chronos what.
But everybody does what he wants.
That’s why I’m saying, “I won’t look at it again” that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my view of nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be deadly to him.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - rather coupons on state expenses.
No, please increase the expenditure.
Those who wanted to know about expenditure failed.
Deleting issues on relatively small expenditure posts, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the error margin in government expenditure in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call their wishes, and during all this time some in each camp make it seem that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
The “debt” is assets mainly held by financial institutions in this country.
The “debt” is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't see any problem that the government would approve one-third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it well.
But that’s not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the nearly unnecessary wind subsidies and the nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you get to a figure that is more ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who wins £35,000 per year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their wage), someone with £50,000 would pay about £100,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pay about £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking charges and car vignette, and it is before VAT.
Almost 30 percent of my money is taken to the source before local taxes and the automotive vignette.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
No matter what a problem, of course, I am happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not seem to believe that money falls from heaven, or it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of tax spend.
How can an unemployed who is looking for work at the gateway prove it?
Even though, 20% of unemployed people wouldn’t look for, that means that 80% are looking for and don’t find.
If I am even unemployed, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances.
Actually, I haven't had any news about Pole Emploi for months, which means that agents are more busy with checking operations than really to make job ads back?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then you need to go from Pole Emploi.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in the event of which, we ensure that unemployed people well fulfill their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their licence to the users of a means of transport, a service manager or employees of their work, etc.
No one is screaming on the scandal in these cases, isn't it?
In fact, it is good to remember that unemployed people have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Paul Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been wrongly established, and on one of the cases, amputed by 40%, it had to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The shipping and control is currently taking over, while statutory Jobs is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, which are those who pay the compensation.
Non-Salary politicians and French people don’t have any rights they don’t have!
It's not normal.
I would add that worthy unemployment insurance involves the value of employed labour.
More than expecting murderous tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this zone of conflict.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black pest in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the movement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit of banning the Hadj in Mexico to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries this year.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused due to their country of origin or recent trips.
In fact, there was a Bosnian pilgrim who contracted the valley in Mexico during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim coming from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it to be heartless only to propose to prevent Ebola sick people from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just a good sense but apparently those who “know” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These countries in West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be put into strict quarantine.
Nobody gets out.
Only healthcare staff can enter.
21 days after treatment of patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconic measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having contacts with people in West Africa even though they had taken “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the advancement of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We prohibit them from flying to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to detect people with typical Ebola symptoms, so they can be immediately placed in quarantine.
It is possible to pass the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to dogmaize the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
He is still far from this concept.
It has only been 20 years ago that information has appeared as the given prize of humanity, while religion, which comes from the brain, leads our actions from Lucy perhaps.
What is the importance of becoming a Protestant Church?
For those who have not noticed this, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not at all put the feet to the Church, there is only a small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiety"?
@louise: Sorry, the church has no limited vision of France.
And in the world, it may be that will affect more people.
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect of others as you consider it before existed in Christ.
A century ago Hillel said to him, “Don’t do what you don’t want to do to others, that’s the whole Torah, and the rest is just comment: go and study!”
Christianity goes far beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the Agape.
Your "make progress justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: we remove incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who has overthrown moral laws by re-defining respect for others.
Christians will then be willing to take their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I believe that the low number of Protestants in France is mostly explained by the fact that their ancestors were destroyed and then converted to force and forced to immigration a few centuries ago.
I don't hesitate to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game will soon be released.
It's not invented.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his cash withdrawal campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth £30.
If this is the PC version that interests you, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount bonus.
I'm going to look.
Of course not at work.
The daily discounts of the IT department block all nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% discount, or is it £30 included 20% discount?
Note: The PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *make the mouth*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat Emptor and all this: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid one day they'd delete you from your library if they decide to get rid of people buying it there while they're out of the planned area.

So, was France in 1940 a "putride land"?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looked like a gift poisoned.
Do you want to love France of 40, the one of "the defeated strange"?
When you see who receives the Nobel Prize of Literature, you wonder whether Proust or Dostojevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the awarded authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano who is already hardly readable in French and who describes a universe so limited and so self-centric?
I hope the rest of the Nobel Prizes are more credible, but honestly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a remote relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for Chinese, Brazilian and other people, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano to its right value, if they don't already know it!
On your side, continue to meet Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
Let’s see who won the Nobel Prize for Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello the frightened.
Since I have been driving one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to break me?
Or do I feel like Superman III's horrifying computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my medocs.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cedar party.
It was Bordeaux.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mixture of people there, there were only CAMRA fans (not to confuse with the fans of the camera).
Drive on the return on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of beginner, I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope that if I get 95, I will be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a trap of lard on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
This means, without wanting to contradict you, I think you're a bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it bans searches for jihadists at the exit of mosques.

We need to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you can access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but again you do a monumental contradiction: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslims or not, who have formally condemned EI and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these official convictions unanimously.
who does not say consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Miravel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and inadequate to accuse them of priori and demand that they publicly manifest to prove to the rest of the French society that it has wronged to doubt it.
This principle is in my opinion the denial of the Republic and can only contribute to the delinquence of the French society.
If there is no doubt, just say it.
Who does not say the word agrees, but agrees to what?
Consent to closeness with EI or condemnation of EI.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house cow and choke.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmaticly intentional.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, “revealing” the Westminster parties because a huge fracture fell between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the evening of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified by the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely fucking off Scotland because they have no seats there.
They can do what they want in full electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to make a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the Promise, thinking that he would save his party, but not realizing that he signed the deadline of his Scottish deputies.
It is not surprising that some Labour Members are asking for accounts to their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important than that.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Circuit pumps by 85% at the expense of 85% is not a super-electional strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish parliamentarians will no longer be able to vote on the subjects relating to England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he's.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband is.
Maggie did it with the Unionists of the Ulster, and it did well to him.
However, he is still in lice to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, largely, these boxes will virtually be behind each reader to look above his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the "life of others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC.
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
In the end, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I expect the next ticket: Amazon produces your book depending on your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's as good as the world.
Progressively stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some editors who have the intelligence to offer files without mouchard.
Given the price I paid to Kobo, it's without regret.
I am ashamed of the generalized appropriation of users with the generalized appropriation of their privacy.
In your large public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding labour managers whose opening and completion rates are likely disproportionate.
For example, Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the era of Big Data, data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo that do not allow either readers or authors to identify.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been so many overwhelming, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in the last days that the country appears to be led by a maternal class full of acidic schizophrenic children.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such a insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot a ball in the foot unless it wins something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will reply, so it is actually shooting a ball in the foot.
A retirement diplomat wrote on his blog: “The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to reverse Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad as this would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent there a serious warning of repressions or simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what is really surprising is that today’s Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is strongly recommended to anyone who focuses on the details rather than on the details balancing by the traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read in mind by keeping the previous realistic observations / warnings coming from Iran on proposal from Afghanistan around 1979.
Who are these “moderate” who seriously fight the terrible Assad Laic and at the same time the pervers of ISIS?
Pipeline policy drives the world to the axis, and I would suggest those who refer to inexistent " moderate" to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending children to fight in the Third World War.
“Is it even worse than if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism?” Is there any other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East in power?
I have one in my head.
It would require a trial in Nuremberg for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Would it be "need"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend...
Wouldn't the criminals be just 120 years old now?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Especially about the triumph of the CUP that planned and led the genocide, Talat and Djemal killed just after the First World War by revenge by Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a damned place in Central Asia nearly at the same time, when there was a dream of falling into the ground.
What a delicious thing!
An impressive control of the sophism of the fatal pen, but besides that, we are in vain looking for contact with the real.
What a cliché without arguments.
The foetus will always hear a heart beating even in the stomach of a carrying mother.
Lesbian couples can simply be a child’s desire and not a desire to be accepted.
The sterile couples are also.
What about the kids!
What a shame to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age of defending themselves, saying they are happy to live, earn their lives and pay the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
She doesn't date today.
Many women have brought and brought into the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like that, we're doing so...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marking" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics, aren’t they as well merchandise of the body?
The Anacronic Fare Unity...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good in a remote country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to enlarge its responsibilities and avoid the scandal in another centuries close to itself without screaming at that time on all roofs!
These practices were no longer made on behalf of the church!
There are not only Christians and believers who reject these practices.
Not less than that the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late 1970s in the Midlands, I only saw this from far away.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you like this and listen to music - that music today always touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many negligible comments here on what Paul Mason says, perhaps they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sport section there is an article about the football that expects your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there is a lack of reporting that really reflects the reality of the northern culture of England.
Nothing is surprising that Paul Mason has well understood the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
This says, you can throw an ear there if you are in the region of London in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story,” but this is a small article well written and well thought.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I liked your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped Newsnight.
Last train for Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and descend to Wallgate.

The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Police Series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Things are becoming increasingly poisonous.
Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (otherwise, that was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization for peace.
And he removed his garments, and put them on the rock, and entered into the water.
A Israelite had stolen them.
The Israeli representative was angry and cried out, “What are you talking about?
The Israelites weren't even there at that time!"
The Palestinian Representative (UN) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard.
That this is unpleasant to the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the purpose searched for...
Anti-Sionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report...
This has always been the case since politics has been globalized...
Avoid, Avoid...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly will last!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force has allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Sionist: Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a report of force today!
Do you doubt it?!!!
In addition, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have difficulty going beyond anything they don’t have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyst balls written by others.
This is what proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter loves it well, which would mean it's a matter of insufficientness).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of consciousness that Russell Brand says certain truths, perhaps the truths that we prefer not to think about.
Take a closer look, this feeling will become more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand scared some: sometimes he speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tablets he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people to dismiss and more to cross the arms, and ignore all the political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles that he posted, it says that the importance of dismiss and dismiss and/or dismiss and/or dismiss and/or dismiss and/or dismiss and/or dismiss and/or dismiss and/or dismiss and/ormiss
I don't necessarily agree with his solution (because I think being politically active by submitting his requests can go to par with the fact of voting, since politicians are pyramids who will change their views if they really risk losing their elections), but it's angry to see all these young people's votes really is going to get out of the argument, but it's just angry to take it.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to discuss what it really says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put away the concerns about him and a large number of people left behind.
Yeah, thank you.
The thing about the vote has been completely deformed.
The inutility of drawing a newsletter in a urn every 5 years makes me deeply nervous because my vote really matters nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic votes, direct democracy, and Members who are locally accounting for their voters.
In addition, I contest the idea that the words of Russell Brand are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even if these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-statistic thoughters and universities derived from the counter-culture that Suzanne would want to group under the label "pseudo-chomskystic balloons".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would be able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head blows added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but eventually became one of his fans and invited him to his show, it is too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It is a political speech that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This “flow” mostly reveals to my eyes that intellectual debate has long been held in the RDV of History where professional historians have become minorities and where exchanges of specialists have been burdened to the benefit of loan-to-think condensed Sciences Po for press dossiers.
In my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as Michel Foucault, a need to deal with a blameful, an emitter.
They develop both very rational thoughts, but this rationality is based on those emitters who are the key to the vow of their thought.
I think rather than for Foucault, the state was indispensable as a guilty.
This belongs to a very archaic thought, sacrificed thought, which is also magical thought.
The problem of the relationship with each other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and / or libertarian pen (in both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first to go to seek the state's help for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not state at Foucault at all.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
Its thoughts are based on the guilt of the state: without that guilt it does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
No support on the other hand.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, the one of his god then, Stalin, the small father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably have read a chouya too quickly if you have taken Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent wouldn't have fun to attack Michel by this way...
Gauchet reflects deeply on the contemporary individual and the collective, the difficulty that the mechanism of accession represents in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabbage orchestrated by human science researchers from the hard-left that do not tolerate that we move from allegiance to their mantras is quite ridiculous.
Narcissism and authoritarianism of these people are unlimited.
An important point to add to me seems to be the position of these “rebelles”, which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other “yellow” who I have been witnessing in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't had the pleasure to hear our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese last time.
In London and they were friendly to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same as the Whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them hold violently anti-White speeches.
My father isn't happy that his elderly daughter is out with a white.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in the last few years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spread out of large cities, and thanks to this prosperity, people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, Russians are mostly prejudiced against temporary workers from Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in professions and areas where they are lucky to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienisei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard Australian opinions about the Chinese and the Aboriginals.
It's really weird that a foreigner tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two in my life (including one abroad), I haven't kept bad memories of them, everyone is worthy and, in fact, those in London were very kind, that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise, you don’t remember who you meet, everyone deserves to remember who you were.
You know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you’re always out with so-called White.
How many Chinese men are with Whites in comparison?
No, because there are many chances that the parents of these Whites would physically attack them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the magistrate.
@Marabout: forgiveness, but the judicial environments are honestly branded right.
When in the union of the court, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativity of the application of laws in the courts, it orders to exclude two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision as of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains the required instrument of the law to upgrade the fundamental assessment.
The measure of its incompatibility in all the judicial acts of judges, including parquet, forced to make a distinction between the error and the partiality of judges.
It would be worthwhile to claim that the acts of justice are not divided into these three groups.
Suggestions and unknownness are not subject to objective analysis.
So if all this is not analyzed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics that implicitly reveals it is very low.
The preceding preambule allows you to well record the following in the third ratio.
The Corruption of the Judgment.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of harm* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heroism.
The area concerned is the splitting of heirs* committed through scrolls to the procedure* by successive genealogists mandated by notars.
This profession gets €150 million in a good year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the French notariat’s almost-immunity.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where the statistical improvement*, which is moderated by the previous comment, is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genderologists and heirs that are contrary to this, a whole set of jurisprudences that are contrary to all heirs' favourable laws.
Isn't the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria then a form of lies?
Totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to deal with the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these tricycles all land, built in custom size and weight, and that really allowed him to enjoy the outdoor like never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires, could not.
As we say, the drops and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tank chair looks like epic.
I don't think the Whill inventor had to clean a dog clutch on a chicken.
I'm sure my sister would like the tricycle every terrain, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a longboard pencil.
There are hills that would like them here.
Prices seem really high, but there are really people putting this kind of price in a bicycle, so "you see."
The tricycle all of the fields seem particularly useful.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have insurance at their disposal of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can allow themselves to practice high prices for things they know substantially that we need them.
We can’t really say that Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it’s just a waste, it’s not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the “long distance” wheelchair does not arrive on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this shit thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intense bombing of densely populated residential neighbourhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18 years of age.
The eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockages.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” to all Gazans.
“The entrepreneurs who work on their projects turn a little from their cement to the black market.”
Oh, that's not wooden language, rather concrete and armed lady...
References are here to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Sionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There is the black market is certain, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli Gaza block since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well maintained land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that after he lifted it, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I am a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The block is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress built against the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've been thinking well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the definition of the economy of sharing, without a profitable purpose.
Many are looking for only one night on Couchsurfing.
So it is to pay (or at least hope) otherwise.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and renters often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with cash, thus turning around Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What does she get to rent?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The word “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
This is an international journal now, in case you wouldn't notice.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers for permission to do business (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, Enf
Have you thought that boats can be moved, stolen, flooded, etc?
The penises are so slow that if someone was trying to steal it, it would always be near where you left it.
Or displaced by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to start it?
The Marine Pen is not right.
Populism?
There is no truth but the one who exposes the facts.
Poverty increases in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017, the messaging will be said!
Capitalism won't grow up!
High finance, speculation, plays with our businesses our jobs, with our raw materials, with our purchases, with our foods, with our health care structures, with our debts, with our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All of this is for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obesity of frick.
Until proof of the opposite, FH said: “My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.”
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former economic minister of the Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there any other competitor?
How do you call it: turn his shirt back, drop his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don’t know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see this?
Because the Germans refused to rescue survivors.
I’m not sure if Spee really “refuted” to save survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that none of the parties seemed to be sure of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cooker in the area.
The sea was shiny at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after the sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a quiet and full day sea.
In addition, rescue officers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I made a quick search on Wikipedia:
“A certain confusion ruled among the German ships with regard to the fate of the two cured cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped shooting, and a racing began.
Leipzig saw something in a fire, but when he approached, he saw that it was just an eagle.
Nürnberg, slower than other German ships, joins the battle late and lives Monmouth, pinched and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his projectors to the ship’s flag, the proposal was rejected and he opened the fire, eventually flowing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22:15.
He was worried about reports indicating a British cowboy in the surroundings, he turned toward the north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flown, and therefore could not seek survivors.
They also thought there was a more important dish of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they degusted to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should climb a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock’s sacrifice had already caused them a mistake and had cut about half of their ammunition, condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes appeal to the UMP to request that it be included in the law that a voter is definitively condemned or that it is definitively inalienable.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the left-wing elections well on.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEI I PROPOSE A INSCRIPTION TO THE MAGISTRATES CONS
When is the prohibition of trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated?
Interested by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always quick to beat those who will benefit from their inadmissibility to hinder the actions of true politicians who are actually trying to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose real estate is in the measure of their sufficientness.
I met them in the subway to the south with their small pancarts" for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political unions whose members have the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if trade unions of right, or even of extreme right, designated for the purpose of personalities of her border and led to a legal-medical war against them.
Your claims are completely free.
If right now defrauds the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that relate to it!
We do not have an example of left-wing personality that has so much to do with Justice, but all who have been subject to her attention have not been treated with favor.
On the other hand, it must be recalled that the union of the magistrate, which is left, is not the only union of magistrates and is a minority.
Let a minister support the trade unions with so much commitment how useful they can be.
@MCR The trade union you cite may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great to the Chancellor, it is not a secret.
Now we are wondering whether the "mission" of some judges is more than to go out than to teach.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like others: they are the only ones who have the power to accuse and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the foolishest famine of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as a tremplin to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stages around the world.
Others then sold a lot of discs or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all of these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is actually one of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision competition, as many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British entertainment stars.
Of course, some fell into forgotten.
But that’s what happens to most stars who don’t participate in the competition.
Rare are those who, after a tube, manage to do another.
In any case, most singers/groups can best expect three albums and a best of them.
Yes, but now Cole, whatever her name, has fans only in the UK.
Her celebrity comes partly from her wedding with a footballer who breathes through the mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more chance to get on a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think all the guitar freakers smoking grass in their father's garage and balancing three agreements on a poem level primary school will certainly become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch even a album out.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a totally artificial distance between the Western public and the studied people – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petrious daily ritual bigoterie, while most of their ways to do are strictly equivalent to ours and ours.
Except for you to interpret inversely.
Whether, but rather than saying that the tambour has no sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières also have a little sacred character?
Our way is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined and circumcised object in the religious sphere.
Very interesting article whatever it is.
It's from the deco ephemere to furnished the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred always lives.
Who still believes in the interpretation of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the orths of no interpretations of the scientifics that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparable criticism of disciplines to laugh a little?
Because that which applies to archaeology also applies to interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your rejection for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is because of them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimony to reconstitute history, understanding societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is passionate.
This method was not very ancient and previously archaeologists trusted their “instinct” and their knowledge, and could mislead themselves.
Today there are so many technical and scientific means that the interpretation of searches is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
There is in full (and old) controversy about chamanism advanced by prehistoric Jean Clottes (see his book "The Chamans of Prehistory", particularly the increased edition of the scientific controversy, published in La Maison des Rocks).
Thank you for this highly instructive article
Do you like sex sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex with sex
For you, Mike, I could put myself there.
So it's over between us?
I really don’t understand why we can’t continue to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the cage level?
No, but we're not against a theatre on it.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy on that, but it would be too gay!
We could expect this kind of comment from you.
It looks like Mary Whitehouse has come back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost finished, I can suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
Can I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays for real, courageous journalists, so that they write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers?
Rather than getting rid of these pussy fucking jokes.
Not very bad.
Then go on.
If these "pussy fucking jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, right?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is absolutely possible to do both and publish an article about anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless, you can find the amateur video of crash on the web...
Amateur video of crash on the internet...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the driver.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have left the safety because at the time or another vehicle (for example) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to end quickly before the typhon, which we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not think it was good to advance the time of departure (TV, pub, money...).
Besides that, they protect the pilots well.
I also share this opinion.
But there’s also the fact that if the very British FOM gets into the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restart to beat the English that then led...
You're leaving on this blog my dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to discover all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There were lots of conspirations in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a remote story of the possibility of a pilot’s victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that leaves security because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of amateur images, the lack of image allows the FIA to avoid botherful questions of the type: How does the Commissioner stir a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the pictures of the accident, but because one of the Commissioners clearly sees a green flag, signs that the race can normally recapture and we are more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark inconsciousness of the F1.
Yes, dear Stephen, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow flag APRES the place of the accident, from which the green flag agitated.
This is the usual procedure.
The commissioner's position just at the accident (as the case may be, it can be at 10 meters and 100 meters after the accident) stirs the green to tell the drivers to take a normal turn.
Sensationism is selling the pub.
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the government’s “patriotic propaganda” offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for money.
And sex, don’t forget sex, fear of having sex, pubs and media are good to sell things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that you don’t really need to worry about is just to keep scaring people to keep controlling them.
“When the tabloids talk about Ebola, we all catch fear,” it should be “deceitful” and not “deceitful”.
Given the medical reference, “took” is much better said in this context than “deraling”.
I wonder if all the people who influence Ebola could begin to spread by air, realize that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse approaching.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules beautifully and solidly this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It depressed me that the media talks about most things with this optimism on the other hand.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without getting to the hystery) so that the government can get us off whenever it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government seeks to save us from crises that he has invented himself.
Is there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing fear?
Congratulations to this post, and to be still in this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning, it had to be terrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going there for years .....
The testimony is perfectly unnecessary.
As always when you talk about science.
Not only does the testimony serve for nothing: taken isolatedly, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot serve as scientific material.
Maybe that's why we stop asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother, a psychiatrist, explains that I was telepathically educated by her grandmother.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's fucking, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Oh, because the testimony of a fact (= here this testimony, which testifies to contamination and efficacy of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
So, what are you based on research?
About fantasies?
Do you place the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving place to verified testimony)?
“Resilience” means the word bidon aduled by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take up for great psychologists after reading from Amsterdam.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in psy.
Cyrulnik hits us with the “resilience”.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will brick us a reliable measurement scale to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels can save us all from Farage and company?
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, ** is not a good idea to get out of the air Sentinels...
So why?
It was a great series and it sounds like those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how will they do so that the children crash?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the genre of humor pic-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The children were crushed.
Oh, because it's a series for children?
The UKIP works for the Mysterys.
Keep your Team America.
Still in supermartion?
It won’t be the same if you don’t see the children and the animation is done well. :-)
I hope to see this (although an adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of rediscovering the elderly.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since we have episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 6:00 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-range commercial channels and you can still see it on these schedules.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a 60-year-old "both" guy, but I'm not watching this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of esplanade!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves a political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In addition, all the Israeli searches below and around the mosque of esplanade haven’t been able to find anything for decades.
The mountain of the temple, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Can it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not searched for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque’s esplanade was built.
His summit, or Rocky Dome, is set out in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mahomet is mounted into the paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah, where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
From the moment it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and they are unfortunately resigned to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and continued to sabotage it!).
It is also good to show how much anxiety of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes say, "Blessed be God!"
To honour tourism in Israel, we are often shown by young semi-deep naïves, hanging on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as you can see on the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary yet.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
Sadly that Reuters’ photographer did not take pictures of hundreds of Palestinians authorized to enter the Temple Mountain and prefer to crash the faithful Jews in counterbass, praying to the Mur of complaints.
@Mat, If this photo disturbs you, it's right, it's neither the journal nor the photographer, but that woman and ideology she translates to be condemned.
This system is not durable and will end in weeping.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to start, large companies have greatly benefited from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they can’t be allowed to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given increasingly significant wages to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will change in this country only when the workers will really speak of a single voice.
Instead of screaming and screaming when someone else makes the strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike not only concerns their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not impeached.
Unless we abandon democracy, in that case it is sustainable.
I'm totally agreeing.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All of this can't end well.
That's because we're in democracy.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies possessed by these people by short-circuit national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that's exactly what the mechanism for dispute resolution between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the Agreement is used.
The Greens are against this project and try to warn people about the inconceivable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
Only recently we have started talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you’ll understand what’s being negotiated in your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, suck and tears”?
This is what makes great repercussions, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next low wheel will probably be the car market.
This man was right, in the 18th century there were trade unions in all regimes.
In the very French Catholic Army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let that (finally, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe the strength of France’s eternal values, and she will fight and close her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the value crisis, shortly: the dissolution of the idea of the nation, having this small relic, is comforting.
Even if it is more and more uncomfortable for her...
They still miss you the trade union of married men, celibataires, married women, celibataires, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don’t write French correctly, I’m a union.
You've been warned, it's your fault.
In order to defend the categories of interests, there are already sufficiently protected professions with trade unions, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are praying not to laugh about the fear of the risk of an official.
It is very well possible to imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without a right of strike as in Germany, in return to the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, disaster.
And with the chariots that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance in fact...
Unknown to ignorance Sybille I was making allocation to military and other officials, as this is the subject here commented...
We shall delete "by means of its delegates" in Article 8 of the preambule of the Constitution of 1946.
It will be: "8.
Every employee participates in the collective determination of the working conditions as well as in business management.”
This is absolutely essential with the rupture of informational power.
And yet you have opened, probably read then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review".????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, this is Joffrey's wedding I've looked at, and I can tell you that some have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey’s wedding, one of the best moments (which is a misleading: it was wine) in television history.
Also from the cake mmhh...
Game of Thrones!
I love the GBBO!
It's the second time that the show ends with the worst victories of the bullshit; no one has made a kind of "boom, this is my fucking cake now boom it and climb in front of your master!"
Perhaps the extra pressure of friends and parents outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outside people were taken away.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I love cooking, but I don't think I'm going to influence it.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us super fun and pushs us to try new things.
Go on to GBBO 2015!
I agree that the last challenge of last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days to do it and they had to brick one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to leave, I don’t know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only true defect they could find was the base a little dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice cream on Richard's mould did not give desire, at any rate Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time given.
There is also cancer, with solar wind blows.
Of course, we are all successful at this moment.
A bad time to spend for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer which is formed just by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field was weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunt" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UVs and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If only humans, they are interested in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), warming us (less than infrareds), modulating our immune system and, apparently, improving our morality.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and lets the UVAs and most UVBs pass.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescendant and consider your interlocutor as a stayer when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor accuracy that was undermined in the commentary, which he himself hears to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am a melanoma habit, UVs do only accelerate its development.
They don’t provoke it.
For proof, not all bronze people have melanomas.
Or, when a toubib tells you that it is necessary to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it is better not to listen because UVs are necessary for every human.
Excess, however, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we stick it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or turn it to the mixer...
I believe that most of those interested in it have found that anything can be wrapped if it is applied to a sufficient force and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as first line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have found that anything can be wrapped if a sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for Nokia 3310.
More precisely, is it already wrapped?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke I have read in the comments today.
It’s hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before installing specific software, you can imagine that the phone was removed from the main production chain and you can see wrong how it could get back there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and is therefore connected with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put testing software on everyone?
Photos on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
It's an article for boobs by excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that industrials are producing in "industrial" We make up super u but all trademarks and small businesses are concerned How to bouffer good, bio avac € 1650 (median salary in French)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For me, food is one.
Go without rancune, I kiss you
They are called fools, or better fools, of people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from reality.
That's the total degrouping of thought-reason.
They are gestational experts, for example, claim to save the planet because they avoid taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferia, joining the left-caviar, from which they are sometimes derived, for example, by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuphery, nor are you surprised to meet criticisms about them often.
Waouh, thank you for this comprehensive and comprehensive theory as well as for all related details (aircraft, shower...).
I would like to be part of it, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The fools are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of the left caviar?
And well, you are able to understand the concept of boozecolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the ecosystems.
Booecolo is actually part but represents only the most visible fragrance of the ecologists because it is the one that infects the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so badly done that she looks vaguely like a female naked.
Fall, you're next to the plate.
We need to be part of the microcosme of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment because you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and still seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become greatly rich and famous without having any artistic ability.
That's the art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emma doesn't know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
This is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy is realistic reproductions of dogs smoking by playing the billard.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you are looking for only this, a camera will do it.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about yourself, without comparing it to the type of drawing you may prefer.
If it’s so easy, why don’t you do it yourself?
There is still something to do with savings: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican guard or the status of generals who are no longer active.
The (honesty) forced to say that France decreases its staff, but as all countries did, sometimes more drasticly, to start with the UK.
It's just half encouraging...
Operating without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at the time when we observe the weaknesses, the deficiencies of our defence tool, particularly in Sahel.
A bad hit for the local communities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: That’s what I said, look elsewhere where to save, but especially not at home, at me, that’s really not possible...
That’s exactly what you propose to do, looking elsewhere where the gabegie is sure.
Whether all those who have been with little or enough military thing swear to come here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without screaming to laugh...
Applying the same position to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reluctant: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministry and you will understand why Defence can be a little loaded!
Well, yes, the savings on which everyone agrees to say that it must be done, though it is seen somewhere, isn't it?
Lack of pots, those on whom this falls gets to the murder when it happens at their home, the poor dear.
It should be done, but above all, that doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not a economy.
Guignols, all right!
How to close the Grace Valley will weaken our defence tool in Sahel?
As for local communities, the history is repeated at every post shutdown, maternity, hospital, hospital.
But everyone is for the economy, of course.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings made in public expenditure.
This article is really the most exciting thing I've ever read!
This is a sad moment when the first three people who comment do the same bad joke.
It’s the depression of making his Facebook thread out and seeing that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie.
It will certainly be based on hilarants scenes where someone falls by accident on his ex in the bus by going to work and only realizes that his juice has returned to his culotte.
It's not a shame, it's totally crazy.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to embrace his emotions and to close his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don’t have “the Internet”.
So I don't think I can comment.
There's no computer.
Oh my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe as satiric journalism!
I'll get it back!
It is absolutely necessary to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter to finally have the illumination and discover the incredible lighting and the insurmountable engineering that jails Mr. Brooker’s keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if it's not women or travesties.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracy: the rise of regional policies and effective association initiatives.
Until new order we confiscate the right to save our planet by states that play tortues at each meeting to save the planet.
So, citizens, we decide to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner that they planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations have ended up ....
Translate: Winds and solar farms are the Rond points of tomorrow.
All funded by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful at its waste level and in case of accident.
As long as the branch is not fully controlled, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided that, of course, our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions in production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more of GES on other stages and especially of gas, or worse of coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittence.
Replacement of nuclear by renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I am not insulting you I am State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 and I have done research in nuclear physics and I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I haven't said is you who lend ideas I haven't said anything about Germany nothing in fact you haven't answered what I said and like all the people of the right demolished the interlocutor I never do.
In addition, I cite the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: the current German renewable energy programme is an inefficient and unprofitable way to reduce emissions of GES and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you don't count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you don't count the greenhouse gas vapor with less effect than the Co2 is true recalled two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part of water vapor and a little in the river water.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!!
The last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it shows your state of mind well.
It would have been the same if they would have qualified India as a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just be to open a box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Atletico is playing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL’s cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our “loud neighbors”...
The low-cost run is paying cash.
Sorry for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests with too cold helium.
So maybe we are not in a defect of design, but in implementing...
Unlike the airspace that is a private company, it seems well that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
If the rule is the same as the state is its own insurer.
They may even pay the satellites in frogs who knows.
This is more angry than many media rebuild the only titles of articles - and many readers only hold these titles.
In total, this creates a wrong impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unjustly questions the project while it is just a launcher problem.
