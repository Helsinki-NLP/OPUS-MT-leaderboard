The triumph of the right-populists in Austria, totally reaching 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both sides of the former major coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-populist sides brought the preferred parliamentary elections in Austria after the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffers particularly from losses, where the position of former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the kippe.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is equipped for a triumphant return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country by 29.8% of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the OVP has cut off, losing almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party that had requested the preferred elections, this is a really catastrophic result.
Still in early July, when the OVP was out of the coalition, the People's Party had a clear prejudice before the SPÖ.
However, the voters have probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party seat and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such development would likely lead to the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to renew the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
Due to the strengthening of both the right-wing parties - the liberals (FPÖs) were temporarily received 18 percent, the GDP eleven percent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their fear that in 1999 could be repeated, even when the government had brought up the European side of the Union's common relations with the populists.
Obviously, Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to work with each party and leaves from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Green Party also joined Parliament, but it suffered slight losses and broke from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent turmoil and has therefore not entered the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If it is not possible to resolve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India for the illegal collection of chickens, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said it could have come to a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
This stressed the Minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian official colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
“If this does not clear, then surely, then there will be some cooling,” he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, the executives could hardly intervene in court matters.
Nevertheless, he claimed that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was freed from the accused and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling wishes to fall into the case in which it is lawful.
"His problem could be explained," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of punishment for freedom, it would be best, according to Mukherdshi, to appeal to a higher instance.
He could so ask for liberation for deposit and wait for his judgment in freedom, the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in negotiations.
“If he recommends a call to a higher court, then he will ask for a gratitude,” the Chef of the Czech Diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can interfere in the whole matter is to allow the convicted to add "kompetent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such a help would already be provided by the Indian side.
“We are very interested in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed, as the Czech press agency ČTK, before his partner, the Czech Republic contributes to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to imprison and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
One answer to the question of whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister left.
"I have already been very much promised," he just noted.
A Czech judges about the ring around the sea ground
It passes on an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are pictured.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and along with its adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, one of the thirty-fifth staff teams of the United Nations Ocean and Sea Rights Division.
His head, the Division Director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
Here are work and enthusiasm.
So far, the sea ground provides a very little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here is oil to find widespread rice and other non-decreasing raw materials, but also unknown living organisms that, for example, carry the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seaground larger than the mainland
The Anrainer states today strongly reported their claim to the new sea areas.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
It is mainly the territory of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simply expressed as a continental shelf, the part of the sea floor and its soils is considered, which represents a natural continuation of the continent under the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the coastal sea, often the border of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the Commission by the country concerned to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be demonstrated by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
To date, the Commission has negotiated over five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka added.
An international echo recently hit Australia’s success, which was the first country to significantly expand its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea floor, which was authorised by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times more than the size of the real state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profit that comes from the use of the sea floor in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratifie the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shell ends, the area of the ocean offer, which is called the Convention as a "common inheritance of humanity" begins.
No state has a special position here anymore.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a golden graveyard," says director Mikulka, with some overtreatment, and adds, "the individual areas of which are legally accurate and the system is contractually reinforced".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the sea floor is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was given in 1991 due to the Convention, as well as the investors of some fewer other states, the status of a so-called "breaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea ground.
"Fördern can be found there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich spot of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt, and mangan,” said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Division Rober Sandev brings such concretion as a pattern.
She recalls a little potato or, with some imagination, the remarkable scheme that has raised the legend to life after the Golems.
German Special Forces were on the ground for kidnapping
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to resolve the geisel crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
The circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists in Egypt are becoming more and more detailed.
According to information from the Ministry of Defense and Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue action.
According to him, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9 were the Flight Staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Help Works at the place of liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the ministry further reported on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because the prisoners had let their prisoners run and escaped when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has adopted the assistance offered by Germany to engage them as supporters on-site.
"Fortunately, this has not come," said a spokesman of the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers had been kidnapped from the travel group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight Egyptian escorts on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the deportation in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the captives in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Chad were captured.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until last as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
The rescued have arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed prisoners were in the custody of the German embassy.
In detail of the release, he did not express himself.
There was no information at first in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Picture" schedule, the five holidaymakers and special forces will fly with an airbus of the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. Representative House Rejects Rescue Packages
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has almost failed the $700 billion heavy rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House has rejected the government’s rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the calls by President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides, there was no majority for the program that would bring the chaos to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on the MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened,” he said.
During the vote, Dow Jones broke by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, to then fall back, after the announcement of the failure.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, the approval of both the House of Deputies and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organizers:
In travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study, even more than 30% for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic prospects, the travellust of the Germans remains untrue, according to a study.
In the bookings for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a salesplus of 31 percent compared to the previous year, according to the German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, there are also increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales plus of the travel agencies for October was about eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
Based on these results are GfK figures evaluating monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and highly calculated for the overall market.
The travel bookings were recorded by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States is particularly required, the DRV reported.
The reservation growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic fields of the Germans are particularly questioned destinations.
Especially pause trips are high in the course, DRV President Klaus Laepple explained.
Given increasing costs for energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for customers than for individually organized holidays."
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so it will be a turnover increase again compared to the previous year – although, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres ski hots in the endless screw, beer made of liter screws and promis in designer-Dirndln.
A Wisn Debut.
Susanne and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes on the weeds, the photographers are already falling on us and cutting the memory cards full - very dirty and that on my first weeds visit.
That's how you become friends.
The Cheap-Dirndl seems to meet its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and in fact north of the white red steakquator, the feeling of well-being remained in the trail until now.
But only once the Theresienwiese arrived, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather shoes; no one looks opposed or harshly touched - everything is completely normal.
Strange sights on the shokobananen stand only harvested my dirndls.
A Munich woman notes me that I had wrongly tied the curtain: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgive, back white."
At home, I'm freeing the screws from behind to left.
"Pass," he said and laughed.
Others make less effort to handle subtle flirt techniques and wear sleeves on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked rear.
The young man with the exhibitionist events is called Bob, coming from England and also visiting the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long "ooooo".
This is what he tells me after he has removed his previously drunken measure.
Just next to one of these hydrates, of whom everyone thinks he's a waste.
So Bob is one of these famous "wild bieslers".
Others have no luck to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o’clock in the evening, healthcare providers run over the hard square, which must take care of the poor lockers.
The nurse always appears in the rudel - always four screw a covering from tent to tent at once.
This works as with most Wisn visitors: Learn, completely back.
Anyone who is in the promille-sarg under the plane can't see.
"These are the ones where goarnimmers pack," one of the healthcare providers shouted to me on request and disappeared in the stomach.
The name of the accident was announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, home to the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday afternoon at the Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspicion of a mild drive.
In the meantime, he was released on deposit.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey was striving to join the European Union, the European forces were interested in deeply penetrating the backdrop of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this missing imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travellers tell you.
The building sits rittlings at the end of the train stairs with a tower at each corner of the front and looks like a provincial German Rathaus.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is broken about
But once you are within the wrapped ticket switch, there is no doubt about the highness of the project, whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was late in the imperialist game, had to dominate the Middle East before its ambitions, through a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist projects were disrupted during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence by Arabs and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces left Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Railway Station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly broken, largely passed from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gate to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Turks.
The governing Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approach.
The Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to evaluate the points of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, Suat Kiniklioglu, Turkey's deputy.
The next morning, about ten-and-a-half hours later, after a busy journey that produced the progress of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which will be considered a new city for the new world government project, the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish unity.
This has caused some misconfidence in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main store of the AKP, a specially-made, ultramodern stone and steel construction, in an evolving predecessor, surrounded by half-made shopping malls and knives in which middle managers in clothing, both men and women, met to complete the first businesses of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central right-wing politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Dress, Krawatte, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exceptional phenomenon,” he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its backland.
Today, it has to look at the East and the West at the same time.
There was no one or the other.
She had to do both.
"But surely Turkey could once," I asked, "being forced to decide?"
“Turkey didn’t have to make that decision,” he said.
He then emphasized a point that almost everyone I spoke with almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be, in the translated sense, Europe as a whole can drive eastern Asia and the Middle East towards the same railways.
Back at Hydarpahas railway station, after another largely unspoken night, I thought of these two German rulerships Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had been watching the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised it would have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too largely, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry at the station that should bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called the sick man of Europe in those days.
At least there seemed to be many doubts about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus next year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the chore singed in 1979 for the last time, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the chore.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form exchanger) was for the readiness and ability of the chorus to attack any music piece presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chorus was often amazing, always excited and remained solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been after years.
How often did death lead us to “leave the music to speak for ourselves.”
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
It's singing!"
His kind of management was absolutely clear and accurate, never dominant but never overwhelming.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any director had to beat the rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well over the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single – often inspired by them.
Handley's death was the rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He deceived the directors who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two well-known horses in the world.
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call to William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "in 1946 he resumed the teaching of Economic History in Oxford and received a Houblon-Norman Research Scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA, and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Jenseits of Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as the British rubber industry.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 under a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his race.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They gave me attention to them because of their lightness and the power they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.”
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large spatial limousine offers a significantly bigger.
This also comes from the technical fineness that enables even more convenient driving and savings of gasoline.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aestheticly seen, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you need to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less known, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sales on other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold alone in Japan.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amounted to 10,000 cars, representing 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 jazz models since 2002, which represents 6.7 % of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branches in Spain are expected to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
Considered more accurately, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows the sales decline in Spain.
In fact, the brand’s leaders hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which are less than 4,000 cars than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this percentage, Honda puts on the appearance of a new model.
It is an Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, which Japanese companies hope to sell about 200,000 models per year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed on the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the market insight is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 metres (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 metres (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axis is 2.50 metres, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters bigger.
The height, on the contrary, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also increased.
This success, on the one hand, is due to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution also used in the previous model of Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the luggage room, which has a system of the double charge surface, reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters greater than the capacity of the luggage room of the first generation.
It should be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 liter petrol engine, as the capacity of the luggage space of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 liter petrol engine is 379 liter.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of panoramic windows, improved access to seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The motors of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, with excellent technical performance, while at the same time providing rotative power for the entire motor lifetime.
The first version of 1.2 liters achieves 90 PS power at 6,000 rotations with a maximum rotation of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine – Jazz’s predecessor model reaches 78 PS – has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and 125 gram CO2 emissions.
With regard to the predecessor engine that reached 83 PS in the previous generation, he is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Bien', avoiding collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for the prevention of accidents, this time Nissan has been inspired by nature, more specifically, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technology to prevent accidents.
Engineers from the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the CEO of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace that is very similar to the Nissan Safety Shield.
However, the most important are the bees’ face-to-face corners that can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly intact in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to shape the round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notes obstacles situated at a distance of up to two meters before the BR23C and located at a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a bordey microprocessor, which is directly translated into a signal to avoid collision.
"At the moment when an obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bees flight and immediately change the direction by turning his wheels by 90° or even bigger angles to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference to any other systems is that this automotive control takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of the project.
Unlike a beer, the robot can deviate either up or down, but also not overeng; he can only move on to two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to turn his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to avoid collisions.
This device only takes a couple of seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the conducted maneuvers, so it can continuously work with just a couple of dozens of KB of storage space.
It sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs or even the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in developing technologies for immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the next ten years with series cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than the diversity of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible use of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system via satellite to lead to the goal while driving and avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's tired before she's burdened with a mortgage.
It must be observed that the U.S. Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the U.S. citizens being involved in hypothetical history of allegedly payable banks, a fun and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’, it says.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of the Bad Loans' or the Disruption.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider one, two, and up to three times whether it is time to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What happens when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the start of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stocks at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the price of the share from August 31st.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be sold back at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be done on the basis of a united average price of $29, which is 28% above the current rate value.
However, the Morgan Stanley share decreased by 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more careful attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last days: Morgan had just stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
‘One week ago’, Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of the MUFG, said in Tokyo, we thought the participation would consist entirely of stakeholders.
But in the light of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves."
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% for its Morgan Stanley shares below their rate value.
And the business will go off with a reduction in profits by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to turn half of its preferred shares into stakeholders within a year if the latter is exchanged to more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. to about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds delivered by MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to cover a payable rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance sheet has been ‘clearly’ down since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to see how their exchange rate decreased by half, while the price for insolvency insurance accelerated to the amount.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other ‘survivor’ of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, partly off at Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic of the 21st century re-creates socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
That third was the one who chose this Sunday, following the example of his equals and friends, the plan of a new constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because, according to the vote of 80% of the voters, the vote voted 64% with ‘Yes’.
According to these results, 28% voted 'No', 7% of the vote were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order to adopt the constitutional project, more than half of all votes must be achieved.
On Sunday, two surveys conducted at the election halls and an accounting of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for ‘Yes’, with 63% to 70% prophecy.
On Sunday night on Monday, Rafael Correa, however, requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had insured in Guayaquil, the headquarters of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean equivalent Michelle Bachelet.
The election held under the Observatory Order of the American States Organization (OAS) was based on a text consisting of 444 points to ensure the 'new socialism', for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers the state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that is mostly living from oil promotion by foreign companies and from the currencies sending migrants to the country.
The project, which will be driven by Correa elected in 2006, will also give the Head of State more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandate every four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and strive for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures that the principle of free medical care and education has already begun by the President to introduce 13.9 million inhabitants in this country, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty limit.
Finally, it also proposes to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorial base as a starting station for American anti-droge operations.
The 19 prisoners were released in Chad
An Egyptian command began the attack on the deportators of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held in the desert for eleven days were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
Tomorrow, they were released from an Egyptian command in Tchad.
Apparently, in good condition, the prisoners on board a special plane reached the military base of al-Maza right next to Cairo’s international airport.
They were directly brought on board of a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a foreign neighborhood in Cairo, to be investigated there.
They are satisfied with all the ‘best health’ and the deportants ‘not paid any redemption’, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the rollfield.
After she was captured on September 19 at a terrain car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of captives was repeatedly brought to the close of 35 unknown deterrents.
There are eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two drivers, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus agency, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said 30 members of the special units, aboard two helicopters, had launched the attack at night just before the morning evening.
“On both sides were shots falling, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,” he said, who wants to remain anonymous.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units were sent to Sudan, where they received support by German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he was located, about the role of the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
“We need to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and the special units,” he said.
He also contested that a ransom had been paid.
The Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land vehicle at a patrol, where the kidnappers were, six of which, including the leader from the Chad, killed and two arrests.
The army stated that they were linked to a group of rebels from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately encountered this movement.
Letters - The quiet majority of culture
Debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a key topic of the current election campaign.
It's better.
But an area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise up and push up the delightful sums that are granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or the national historical places that are complaining about?
Which politician will be afraid to remind the federal government that it ignores its monuments and culturally significant buildings?
Is there no right law in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protects our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3.5 million euros only and alone for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all government districts in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the historic societies of Quebecs, at least 40,000 honourable people gathering in 211 historic societies are striving to intensively address history, save the number of private archives, and retain the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage that protest with the strength of despair when supporters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten frielies.
When will there be a scene for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments of the Fortis Bank
In part, Benelux states want to take into account the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank in the turbulence of the U.S. financial crisis: the three states provide the bank and insurance institution, which also has establishments in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission's Competition Authority.
In the Eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now made in connection with the Bank could have a pre-existing character.
In the sense of the decision made on Sunday, all three states purchase the bank’s respective shares to about 49 per cent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its shares to all of the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis’ shares started a steep valley journey last week, in which in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios were already recorded.
Analysts agree, however, that the bank is too large for a pleite with its 85,000 employees.
The institute’s securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year-old depth.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share rates, the group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion costly American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets debt in the valley flow of Fortis shares.
However, on Monday, the courses have risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the Bank’s new Director-General.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interest in a real offer.
The Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should sit down for his money, he said.
So far, there has been no panic among the customers, the bank’s branches have not been struck.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in chicken table
Due to the drug consumption of a person in America, life and health insurance often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market may become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in an independent hand, otherwise we trust the chickens to the puppy," cites Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurers determine the fees as well as the amounts of expenditure in case of damage depending on the customer’s health condition, and if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Earlier, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with regard to the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more favorable method: Based on the customer’s identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, saying which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates the disease of the client and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol reducing drugs, it could result in that his blood fat levels are untreated, which would automatically turn him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurances have to do more than the paper cram, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraine and heat swallows, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer's perspective, while the not mentioned above.
For the query and processing of the data, companies have formed themselves who, before they collect the data, ask the patient for his consent.
So far, they have to do so by law, although discontinuations have not been fulfilled until now.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory surveys and connect them to the data on drug consumption, thus providing a more precise picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling their use at the same time becomes more difficult.
Although there is a personal data protection law for health data, its effect applies only to health and insurance providers.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress that authorities can also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard believes that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can be shared only with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is of course that the data subject is hardly able to prohibit access to his data, as otherwise the insurance does not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are just left in some way the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
The European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are the leading trade partners on both sides, this was the main issue next to other global issues at the nineteenth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also held, where mainly we are discussing cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more votes and interlingual rights in international concerns, the Member States have not agreed to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at the nineteenth meeting in Marseille yesterday.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcomed India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an agreement reached that would double trade in the next five years, i.e., increase to EUR 100 billion.
Given the fact that the trade trade has increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also legally concluded a deal, so that air traffic will be flooded in the future.
By 2009, India wishes to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The goal is to create a balance between the EU and India in the present time: while the Union of India’s partners is number one, New Delhi is only ranked nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This includes the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or in relation to terrorism, which both sides were most severely convicted, and the inclusion of a UN conference was also encouraged.
The Doha round should also be completed, both sides blame the failure.
The EU stressed that it holds on to its energy and climate programme, which is to reduce pollutants emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to close a global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, thus both supporting the integration of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The head of the Indian government today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, we hope to purchase orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to reports of the agency, the agreement will be concluded for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong Italian publisher presence at the Frankfurt International Buchmesse.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.

A press conference will follow the structure of the Room in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book show: at this opportunity, figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed about the publication in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers in the whole, but in particular in the Adult and Youth Party.
A year ago, Steve Fossett’s missing small plane
Steve Fossett's small plane, a billionaire missing on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a plateau of 3000 m high in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the United States of California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human residues.
Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully confirmed the latest doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized to which a troops were sent. Now we have the confidence that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human residue was found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation Safety (NTSb) noted that a crew had been sent for hours after the aircraft was detected, which identified the plane: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett launched a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Last night, some of Fossett's personal items were found in California, near the border with Nevada, from a pair of homes at the Mammoth Lakes.
This is two certificates called Fossetts, both spent by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth run, as the first man to turn the world’s ball in a hot air ball: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he fled the world on a single flight without intermediate landing with an airplane.
Some of his records also include a 15445 meters of height over the Andes, which is with a co-pilot.
Look, the advertisement you don't expect
A Suv, which falls from the conventional schemes through its original design and the special line-up, the discharged surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to breathe the new sector.
Just because of its exceptional properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also seem unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from October 17th.
This is how the advertisement drums, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – which is a new news in the automotive sector in the remaining Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various stages, which will take the central shopping miles of Milan, to Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D bricks distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special optics: the new Suv will appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car appears so apparently from the posture on which it is depicted.
With the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details in different moments to reassemble it as a whole.
It is undoubtedly the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of autoclame in this rather stereotype field.
But will it manage to travel the interests of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who are the Italian Hooligans
They come from Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are the only 150-200 boys and girls who are shameful to all of Italy now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has traveled behind the Italian national team for years, and who, honestly, hasn't caused any serious problems until recently.
So far, it has never happened to conflict with enemy fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters came from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia there are also smaller groups from campaigns and Apulias.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were far away on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there has now been a confrontation with a truly right-handed fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, 144 cards were provided to the Italian fans for the game: all were issued on names and therefore easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among the traveling to Sofia, no one was under a ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian crew who had already been preloaded in this regard were also denied the ticket and travel to Bulgaria.
The Viminal is now waiting for the Bulgarian police reports to start further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifos can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international prohibition that prevents access to stages across Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer put one foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now, of course, there are fears of relief sites that could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be released immediately, and this will never give an opportunity to justify such behavior," the Viminal said.
That is why, "Get a look at the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of Italian ultrasound in Apulien.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Surveillance), on Tuesday, gathers the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, that is, the secret services that are dealing with the problem of the stadium injury.
"Duce-Duce calls and lifted right arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in unpleasant joy), who has been the director of the Observatory at the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the Police President of Trieste, where the core of the supporters of the 2002-based Ultras Italia originated.
Although it is true, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duke, but it was undoubtedly the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a shame.
“I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Observatory – crimes are bound in the country of their actions.
So far, this group had been in prison, but now it has to be considered what has happened and what will happen.
But we also talk about the Pfiffs during the Mamelis hymn: this is not a crime, but they allow me, but there is lacking education.”
