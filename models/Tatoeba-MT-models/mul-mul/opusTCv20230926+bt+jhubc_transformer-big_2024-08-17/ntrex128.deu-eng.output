Members of the National Assembly for Wales feared confusions with the Muppets
In some Members of the National Assembly, the proposal to amend its title as "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) would be encouraging.
The reasons for this are plans to change the name of the National Assembly in “Welsh Parliament” (Walesis Parliament).
Members of the National Assembly are afraid of becoming the target board of the spot.
One member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly said his group was worried because the name was “Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Wallian readers: In Walis, “twp” for “doof” and “pwp” for “Aa”.
A member of the National Assembly of the Party Plaid Cymru said the whole group was “unfortunate” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which currently designates a law for name modifications, said: “The final decision on names for the National Assembly members, of course, lies with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which highlighted wide support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of the National Assembly Members, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or the Welsh Parliament Members group preferred, while in a public hearing the MWP option was most supportive.
The Members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the ringing of a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is planning to submit a bill within weeks, could be a problem.
The Reform Act will include further amendments to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualifiing members of the National Assembly and the design of the Committee System.
Members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country's name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country is to be changed into "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was adopted to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name of Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim to the Greek territory is raised, and has repeatedly spoken against its inclusion into the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the people's vote on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Glocks Silence in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I talked with said in the past there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no longer both today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“The social life of people today looks different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly meet.”
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough for as long as the church leaders accept and that they will "be back at the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments where people live who do not support the remaining refugees.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy property apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the full closing of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who enter these property apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist community ended in the 1930s.
A black community, which was holding their divine services nearby, became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to stop or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but as the father of Johnson's community members planed rebuild, they ordered the Glocken game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, called the Glocking Game proudly "the Glocks of the Armed".
The expert who played the game in July used other words: “A cultural treasure” and “an unsubstitutable historical instrument”.
In addition, Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, found that it was the world's first black musician Dionisio A. Lind to be played, which was changed to the largest black musician at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been played in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated history with architects and contractors, which were partly attracted by the leaders of the church and partly by the Bishop's diocese.
The municipal board – the municipal leadership committee consisting of Laien leaders – expressed written concerns against the diocese in July that the diocese would try to disclose the costs to the municipal board, although he did not participate in the supervision of the architects and contractors qualified by the diocese.
Some community members complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured in California, 13-year-old when diving to lobsters
In California, on Saturday, on the first day of the Lobster season, a Hai attacked a 13-year-old boy as he dropped to Lobster.
The attack took place just 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV broadcaster in San Diego, he had been with friends in the dump for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy's help shout and padded to the boy with several others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought he was happy to have a loving girl arrested, but then he realized that the boy shouted, “I’ve been crushed!
I've been fucked!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire key leg was stirred up.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water, ‘There’s a hae in the water!’,” Hammel added.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of hail that was responsible for the attack was not known.
Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a hai had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but it was concluded that it wasn't a dangerous hai.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials closed for investigation purposes and for safety reasons 48 hours beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 hay species in the area, which mostly are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take advantage of the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury’s sets out cosmetics departments that are busy with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale contribution to the UK cosmetics market, which is 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales are declining, the larger cosmetics sectors will be tested in eleven branches across the country, and if they prove to be successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
Investment in cosmetics collapses with the search for the supermarkets for ways to use differently store areas used for previously used television equipment, microwave equipment and household goods.
According to Sainsbury’s, the volume of its cosmetics offer is doubled to up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores like boats.
In addition, the supermarket makes a releasing of its makeup series “Boutique” so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that younger customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the fragrance store will test the fragrance store in two Sainsbury's branches sales points. The first sales point was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local needs item stores means that supermarkets have to do more to encourage customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the sales sites will look more and more like sales houses as the supermarket chain is trying to fight the discounter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat Chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has established hundreds of Argos branches and a number of Habitat sales sites, which has increased food sales and profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute about the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer’s branches in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 branch pharmacy store to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in addition to an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues available as advisors.
Our brand range is tailored to all the needs. Due to the attractive environment and affordable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics shopping, which is a question of the way of shopping to date."
Peter Jones “witting” after Holly Willoughbys’ withdrawal from a business worth 11 million pounds
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “white” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby retreated from a business worth £11 million with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The two businesses were compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angry “Dragon’s” star Peter Jones through her extremely short-term withdrawal from her luxurious lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connectivity contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones has been “white” when the Golden Girl of TV at a stressed meeting on Tuesday at the center of its business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to its new businesses – worth up to £1.5 million – the common homewear and accessories brand Truly could no longer spend enough time.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and would probably double Willoughby’s estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his real estate.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly with distance.
It should safeguard their future for them in the long term over the next decades.
His decision to withdraw was completely surprised for all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the market was introduced.
At the central in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, which is one of the most successful stars in the UK, could cost the company millions because of its high investments in products from boots and candles to clothing and homewear and any other possible delays in market introduction.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40% share of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A source nearby Jones said last night: “We don’t comment on his business.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He laughed at the criticism of the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive statements about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said following the voice of a news moderator:
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was awarded by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Nevertheless, the negotiations of denuclearization have fallen into stock.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world at the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly that the North does not see a “responsive response” to the U.S.’s first destruction measures.
Instead, he noted, the United States held sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his customer service speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were before a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship showed positive results: at the end of the missile test, support for the release of prisoners and the return of the deadly remains of American military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual way to talk about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to enter this overfilled arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of human lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations said they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made very clear that they do not require international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children creates a team to travel to Palu, it is still unsure whether foreign employees can work on-site.
Sutopo, spokeswoman of the Catastrophe Protection Authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies might participate in the aid measures.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While buildings were built in Aceh Tsunami protection properties, these are not a daily view of other coastal strips.
The obvious lack of tsunami warningrene in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths despite a warning entry into force.
Traveling between many islands in Indonesia is an ideal challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A lazaret ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but will reach the location of the new disaster at least in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the attacked Indonesian infrastructure to the core of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the next year's re-election Joko suffers from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is pressured by persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and homes, when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with Machethens, pillars and arches, and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri at around 27 meters away from Chelsea at 0:1.
He targeted the ball to the left and then shot him in the direction of the back foot.
The shooter sailed high over the strafroom and operated into the right upper corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the network.
“I just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for me,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just accepted the shooting."
Chelsea led the Belgian Star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute after a hit with 1:0.
The Blues storm gave a passport with the ferse back to Mateo, then turned down close to the middle field and sprinkled into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double passport in the middle field.
Then he shot a good passport, so that Hazard entered the strafroom.
Hazard left the defenders behind and shut down through the rear of Liverpool's Alisson Becker with a left-wing board.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadium San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will meet at 15:00 a.m. in the UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday.
The number of Tsunamis deaths in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster protection authority reported on Sunday morning.
Many people have been arrested in the tremors of buildings that were brought to an invasion by the earthquake of the 7.5-speed from Friday, which had been caused by waves up to six meters high, official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded by invaded buildings.
Police arrest men, 32 years old, for murder suspects after a woman was kidnapped
After the discovery of a women's lap in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. at Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspect.
The police asks the residents to sign up if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early stage, but I would like to contact everyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious.
In addition, I ask all people, particularly taxi drivers who may have taken a Dashcam, to contact us, and they may have information that is of the greatest importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and found in a building.
Tonight afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman came to the killer to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are underway, and the police said it was in order to inform the next victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours until they can return to the building.
It has been heard as a police officer told a man that the whole area is now treated as a murder.
A woman appeared in tears in the place of the event.
She repeats, “it’s so scary.”
At 14:00, two police vehicles were inside the shutdown and another vehicle before the shutdown.
Within the closure, several police officers were watching the housing block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 555 111, and refer to the protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell Statue before Parliament becomes the most recent monumental object of the controversy about the re-reform of history
Their rejection would be poetic justice for his reminding of the Taliban to destroy so many cultural and religious art products of England by his fanatic puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Cricks’ proposal as “tooth” and “an attempt to rewrite the story.”
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s standpoint was made a target before Westminster Palace.
The image tower in the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent presentation of Cromwell is proof of being celebrated for the 19th-century opinion and part of the history writing of a figure, which many people still think is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, than anyone who considers the parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course, by the monarchy.
Whether it is a fully applicable presentation, the subject of continuing history debates is.
It is certain that the conflict has formed the subsequent development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this cluster.
His services as a lord protector are also worth celebrating and reminding them.”
Killer pig kills Chinese farmers
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southwestern China.
The man, to whom only the surname was called Yuan, was found dead with a bloodstreamed artery near a pork hall in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig building is prepared to inject pig vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
According to reports, he was joined with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw a door to a neighbouring pork room open.
He said that in the stall there was a large male pig with blood on the nose.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg heavy pig had killed the farmers.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and dumb,” the cousin, to whom the name was called “You”, was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent attacks on other people while police collected evidence at the incident.
Yuan’s family and market authorities have negotiated reports on compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, a 290 kg heavy pig climbed a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could contaminate the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood may seem as a “discharger”.
“They’re just playing.
They like to screw and are very curious... they aren't trying to hurt anyone.
You just need to treat them with the right degree of respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread rain in the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way through the cold water on the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring rainfall in North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 eastern coast time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific begins to form a trough that moves toward the east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported to the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimeters of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture generates strong precipitation in the southwest during the coming days through interactions with the attracting trough.
Locally 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous fluttering floods, water-driving shoots and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to rainfall rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 inches per hour, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, it is expected to rain up to 5 to 10 centimeters.
Due to the spread of tropical precipitations, there is the possibility of fluent floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Due to the threatening tropical rainfall, it is urgently advised to walk into the desert.
Strong precipitation can lead to rising flows from canyons, and winds bring local wind floors as well as wind that leads the dust with them.
The nearby trog brings locally strong rain in parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that total kidney strike amounts of more than a centimeter that can lead to low-scale water-driving shooting and smooth pathways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first unified tropical rainforests reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. It rains widely on Monday and Tuesday evening.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads to the Four Corners region and holds on Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature fluctuations throughout the US are possible as the Arctic is cooling while the trophies remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 12 oC.
In the next few days, the ongoing summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the Middle and East of the United States, a warm October start is expected with widespread temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is approximately 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of excessive temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
More than 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday on six television networks the striking statements of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, nominated for the Supreme Court, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the television broadcasters stopped their regular program on Friday due to a last minute return: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, according to the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee to be 100% sure Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers have seen the hearing from Nielsen.
The company identified the average audience numbers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring audience numbers in offices.
In order to turn this into the right perspective, this is equivalent to the numbers of viewers at a play-off football game or at the Oscar lending.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks, according to Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the day-to-day hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by cameras by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protesters in the lifting chair sternly insulted him on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with a slight look for minutes while he was screwed, and the scene was transmitted live at CNN.
“I’m right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he tells the truth to the country?”
“They have power while so many women are powerless,” a woman said.
Flake said his office had published a statement and supplemented before the lift chair ended that he would have to say more in the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks were sent live hours later when the Justice Committee should vote on the transfer of the nomination of Kavanaughs to vote to the entire Senate.
Nevertheless, Flake said he would do this only under the condition that the FBI, as well as the democratic minority, would investigate the charges against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by interviews with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flakes’ decision was of great importance because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes for the confirmation of Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has filed an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to take advantage of Britain’s future for political purposes and undermine the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May meets on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party party party in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the newspaper’s headline, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson exacerbated her attack on her so-called “chequers plan” for Brexit by providing a proposal for the mutual initiation of duties by the UK and the EU as “very absurd”.
Death shootings on Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU) in connection with the deadly shooting at Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published videos of the contest between Sims and Simpson, according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reported, the police secured the glasses on the board and said that they had been found at Simpson's DNA glasses.
According to an interview with Simpsons, the police said he had put the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the deposit has been set to $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a shot on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal technical laboratory of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their support in the leading investigation into the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for “her care and striving for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98m-sized wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “deeply shot” about Wayne’s death and “be shocked.”
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Vulcan has been thrown into the city of Mexico.
The asses thrown out of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern neighbourhood of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and 183 outbreaks of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of grooves and shootings.
Pictures on social media showed thin sheets on the wind protection plates of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have found that since September 2017, an earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexico has been shaken, increased activity in the 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflict between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after conflicts between the Pro-Independence Police and Pro-Independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, which were kept by the disposal police, also preserved them with eggs and slide color powder, so that in the streets normally populated with tourists there were dark dust clouds.
In the next day, it was also handmade with the police who used their strikes to stop the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups scanned “No Forget, No Forgiveness”, while Unionists opposed them, calling “Length living Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the protests.
However, a year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by separatist Catalans in Madrid, the situation in the independent region is still very stressed.
The voters had decided with an overwhelming majority for independence, although the election participation was low, as the opponents mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent collisions before the elections.
Pro-Independence groups had camped on Friday overnight in the open to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we hang firmly,” he said.
Despite an important, though short, victory at the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining the vibration. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in the exile or in prison, where they are on their procedures because of their role in the organizing of the referendum and inclusion of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest on his phone in favor of the police, said that the conflict was shot by politicians on both sides.
“The situation will always be stressed,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the European Parliament election next year.
“As a candidate for the European election, the best way to tackle the decreasing of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men are arrested after the house was fired by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been repeatedly kidnapped by a car.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building themselves were damaged.
Also, he may have been shot on the car with a armband.
Menga trigger means Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first gate to Livingston secured the victory.
The upstairs Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and only led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas Treffer proved to be a crucial part of Gary Holt's team in the second half of his life with hibernian.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership in this season without any outward victory and will stand in front of the Hearts next Sunday, which will be back eight points.
Previously, the Rangers are hosted in the Europa League for Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his victory series in the division to six games, i.e., Cheftrainer Holt has not been defeated since he took Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against freely playing guests
Holt's team had to be headed for a long time before the match, as his directness faced the Rangers with the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but it became slower before the door, then Alan Lithgow could shoot far after he was investigated to meet Craig Halkett's headquarters at the door.
The hosts enjoyed letting the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This way the decisive gate came to be able to do so.
The Rangers left a free hit, and Livingston prepared a chance when Declan Gallagher and Robinson took Menga together in a shot position, the man shot the door with a ball contact from the middle of the strafroom.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but the host's defense couldn't overcome, and Gate Guard Liam Kelly remained largely unpleasant.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once was forced to defend.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers Gates Guard Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow slipped the ball out of another standard situation from Livingston.
Flanken came back to Livingston’s strafroom and were regularly driven out of the danger area, while two demanding criminal offences – one of Glenn Middleton’s wheelchairs and one of Glenn Middleton’s hand game – were denied.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenon performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have overcome the expectations of this rising trend again.
Their game mode and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt has been fairly praised for the way he has been watching the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led to an excellent organized defence while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on track during the entire game.
The Rangers missed inspiration.
As much as they were temporarily under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the host’s team – and that’s something like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue sky ruled when the government heads of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany that should serve to repair the relations between NATO allies.
There were disputes on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police called for security reasons that she abstained from a strong crowd of people from gathering before the mosque, but many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard and condemned Erdogan’s policy as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarising effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as a hero and by others as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford: Bike driver dies in a collision with a car
At a collision with a car, a bicycler died in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficking street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped, and sanitary officers took care of the man who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist died in an accident with drivers fleeing at Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers away from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next relatives.
Road interruptions and redirections for buses are furnished, and the drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officials injured in anxiety
According to the Prison Office, six prisoners were injured in a high-security prison for men.
The disturbances broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialized “Tornado” officials were attracted to end the disturbances involved in eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
The officials were treated on site due to smaller injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel were used to resolve a ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don’t tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that police officers will be handed over and possibly spend longer time behind gitters.”
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 criminal prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison captain was reported to have been treated by a criminal prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, police officers were invited to prison to deal with serious troubles in which the staff was attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluent floods (door areas may benefit)
It’s rarely happening that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what will happen early next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa drag over the deserted southwest and bring the risk of fluent floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about fluent floods on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada and southeast of California and Utah including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach Monday night with rain and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cycles have come near as tropical storms or tropical depression in Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeter precipitation with a single rainfall of up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the deserted southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and combined up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who do not have the risk of fluent floods, the precipitations associated with rose can be a blessing due to dryness in the region.
Although floods are seriously concerned, this rain will probably be useful in part, as it currently rules dry in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme dryness occurs in somewhat more than 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, the hurricane’s path means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have a hurricane intensity with a maximum wind of 136 kilometers per hour and is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and then the hurricane will move 19 kilometers per hour to the north.
In the Pacific, the storm will encounter colder water and thus weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet on Monday afternoon or -night in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The precipitation can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flood.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, rainfalls are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm in northern direction over Mexico, early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression reaching the border to Arizona and then moving up to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
"As a major threat, very severe precipitation is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the U.S. southwest of the desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
As a consequence of these rainfalls, life-threatening floods are expected in the desert, and in the waters of streaming waters, as well as in mountainous areas of Erdrutsche.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
According to the finding of a 16-year-old who was injured in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to police from Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to register.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “under the unity, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the scrupulous and unlucky tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a customer environment in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “under the unity, anger” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before Congress and resigned the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually disturbed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also said his accusation in the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in service to the public,” he said.
The President was indirectly referring to the nomination of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters to participate in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
I don’t agree, but I actually agree,” he said.
“This is why I fight for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that Democrats are seeing their mission in "to resist and block it."
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader said against CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes killed in Indonesia, victim numbers rise
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were flooded when giant waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people came together on Friday at a party on the beach of Palu, when when the dark broke up to six meters high waves on the beach, many people broke down to death and destroyed everything that was on their way.
The tsunami had been an earthquake of strength 7.5.
“When the Tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people still went after their activities at the beach and didn’t immediately run away from them, and they fell to the victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster protection agency BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The Tsunami did not come alone, he took cars, trees and houses, he touched everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, and added that the Tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he reached the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees on the escape from tsunami and had survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated and lodged in 24 centers in Palu.
The air recordings published by the Catastrophe Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and stores, forbidden and invaded bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shot down by further abductions.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released from Friday was denied the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb thrown on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could be bigger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “complete” and indicated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were invaded.
According to his reports, some of the bodies of the victims were found in the invaded buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damages along the coast could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in a area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the beef.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the authorities were often criticized for not having informed that a tsunami palu had been hit, although the waves were reported at the time of the warning.
Amateur photographs published on social media show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street under him from the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes force a water wall on the shore and swims buildings and cars from it.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
Due to beating and tsunami, there was a massive electricity failure that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending freight aircraft from Jakarta and other cities with support, but the evacuated still urgently requires food and other life-needed goods.
The city’s airport remains closed until October and was reopened for help.
For Sunday, a visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the employees reside in tent houses in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, they passed on stages of destruction.
"They said they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The location is very bad.
Even when the help groups began the hard task of launching disaster aid, some of them said that professional foreign aids would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial assistance, delivery and staff from abroad are only possible if the place of a disaster has been declared a national disaster territory.
That hasn't happened so far.
“In the moment there is another disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, that’s a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami fell over Palu on Friday, friends and family members of the still missing were hoping for one of the wonders that highlighted the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a wastewater channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces released a woman who had been cleaved under turmoil for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings to end Asian games in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Others of the Roa-Roa Hotel were imprisoned, such as Mandagi supplemented his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told him how in the hours after the message of the Roa-Roa hotel’s invasion of the paraglider rounded, WhatsApp desperately sent messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages instead of blue hacks only led to grey questionnaires.
“I think that means that the messages have not been sent,” he said.

Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name in Ye.
In the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known as Kanye West beings).
West, 41, has been named after Ye for some time and has used him as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change is before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears in the broadcast as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer’s statement, has cancelled for “emotional reasons”.
The word is not only a shortening of its current professional name, but it has, according to its own statement, a religious significance for the West.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a conversation about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy this year.
“I’m you, I’m you, I’m you.
From Kanye, what “the only” means, just “Yes” has become a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album reflects what we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known among the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with the West, has written his name with and without binding letters and big letters.
Mexican AMLO praises not to use the military against civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pleaded to never apply military violence against the civilian population while the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people”.
Soldiers fired on 2 October 1968 on a peaceful demonstration on the ground and killed 300 people. At that time left-oriented student movements were established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador praised young Mexicans by supporting monthly aid for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities introduced young people to criminal bands.
U.S. should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its expenditure for research in this field, says investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements in various areas of the U.S. government, although the U.S. generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China proposed its plan last year: the country intends to become number 1 in the field of KI innovation by 2030.
“The duplication of the KI research budget would be given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the United States, a good start. We are looking for the next KI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The duplication of the funds could double the chances that the next major KI success would be achieved in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent KI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University at a KI system that defeated the highest ranked American Othello player and later led Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Lower Release in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the time of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
According to Lees, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive state grants.
“Not China takes away the academic top forces, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up correlations from universities to work on KI.
According to Lees, a change in U.S. immigration policy could also be favourable for U.S. KI efforts.
“I think people promoted in the field of KI should automatically offer green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances individuals to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations granting funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to participate in industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month to invest $2 billion in the “AI Next” initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million annually in KI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. laws on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country's name
The Macedonian population voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed into "Republic of North Macedonia", which would support a decade of conflict with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's requests for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised to the Greek territory, and that is why Greece has put a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but a boycott campaign doubts that the election participation reaches 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the vote was, “Are you for a membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is the price of enrolment in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote result is not legally binding, many Members have said sufficiently that they would follow the result to make it crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said no reports on irregularities had been reported by 13.00 p.m.
However, the election was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66% of the registered voters resigning their vote.
“I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, in a referendum on the change of the country's name, which will open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage before Parliament in Skopje and presented chairs in front of tents set by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the backing,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn around to others like China and Russia and become part of integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in an urgent investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be because more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
According to him, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote "yes".
In order to succeed the referendum, election participation must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe strike for the prowest government’s policy since its overthrow of power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City manages through the entire Brighton resistance to reach door
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton victory at the Manchester City 2:0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He hurried between three Brighton opponents and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green trikots.
He played around a defender and then overcome several other defenders on the edge of the straf of Brighton.
Then he shot a passport to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the strafroom to play the ball back to Aguero, who moved with his right shoe Brighton guard Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the network.
“Aguero struggles with problems in his feet,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he got a door at this moment.”
However, Sterling gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good passport along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blue attacker targeted the ball into the network just before he went out.
City plays in the Champions League group game Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies the game
Since the nationals were expelled from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the powerful cutter always hopes to stand on the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies that have a game advanced in the NL West before the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the Playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we are playing nothing, we can at least throw away because we know the atmosphere of the viewers here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not participate in this competition?"
The nationals have not yet announced a start-up player for Sunday, but according to reports, they tend to throw screws in such a situation.
Scherzer, for which this would be the 34th bet as a start-up player, exercised on Thursday in the bullpen and would throw on his normal day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington law firm has this season a statistic of 18-7, a ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump suspends customer engagement in West Virginia
The President was indirectly referring to the situation in relation to Brett Kavanaugh, whom he elected for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of the Republican voters to participate in the interim elections.
“Everything we have done is on the game in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
“It’s one of the big, big – I don’t agree, but I actually agree, so I struggle for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again with all means, you see the unity, the deception.
It doesn’t matter who they injure, who they have to go through to obtain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we will not give them.”
The Democrats, he said, see their mission in "to resist and block it."
“And you see this in the last four days,” he said, denoting the Democrats as “wholesome and common and deceptive and unfair.”
He called in particular the highest Democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud call to the audience.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
“No, no, I’m waiting for one – it was a really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour no longer allows all opinions to apply.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to shave me, this was little surprised.
Finally, I am the last of a series of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome – only because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly as she had raised herself strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the Tadel’s request for a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically of similar topics, which Jeremy did not agree with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday, "the meetings should be all inclusive and productive."
Mostly, the Friday night GC meetings in my eight years were exactly the same as local Labour Deputy.
Today most sessions are unfortunately not characterized by this tone, and the promised "more friendly, more friendly" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever started at all.
It becomes increasingly clear that divergence views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is assessed after whether it is accepted by the party head.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader; colleagues with whom I had previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to make a return and take positions with which I would otherwise never agree – whether it is about national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – it doesn’t matter what I’m saying – follows a smuggling tirade in the social media calling for my choice, calling on the political center and saying I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I do better than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist convictions every day and never give up small contributions.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that deceptions have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn urged last week the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with any request of misconfidence and any amendment to the election rules, the party becomes closer.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to draw my mind and not to express my opinion so clearly, then I would “not have any problems”.
But I didn’t go to politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I struggled with the negligence of the Thatcher government, which caused my classroom literally to fall apart in the general school, joining the Labour Party, for better public services for those who need it most urgently – as a municipal council as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a break from my political views, even in the last election.
Nobody in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of the Friday’s request, I just want to say that, given the fact that the country is going to harm a Brexit, households, businesses and our public service, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely fun game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now one of the ten teams in the top of the table.
Finally, the home team’s success was due to their superior defense as well as their better chances, and coach Peter Murchie had all reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unsuccessful, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie von Melrose said, “Recognition for Ayr, they have better exploited their chances than we.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, raised by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr to lead. However, Melrose could, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, released for the game by the warriors, allowing the numbers to speak, and Jason Baggot fing an unexpected attempt.
Climo constructed Ayr’s leadership with a criminal offence before he achieved a hit directly in the middle of the day and then achieved an increased attempt at the single entrance, so it was at pause 17:5 for Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then a longer interruption occurred due to a severe injury by Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the game field, and after continuing, Ayr built his predecessor by an increased attempt by Climo by Stafford McDowall.
Then, Blair Macpherson, who worked as Captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again, Melrose paid the extra man by an unexpected attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a phase of enormous pressure.
However, the home crew returned, and as Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained from the criminal gas from a touchdown behind the previous Ayr package.
Climo has grown as almost since the interruption after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent Flanking player Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
"Still Game" star appears ready for new careers in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a change in the host industry after it turned out he was named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC broadcast, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next nine season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official entries, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow’s “flowering restaurant shop”.
"The Sea belongs to us": Bolivia, enclosed by country, hopes that a court opens its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol before the maritime headquarters decorated with tavern in La Paz.
In public buildings, a multi-blue flag is affected.
Fleet support points from Titicacasee to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Regaining it is a duty.”
In every country-closed Bolivia, the memory of a bloody conflict about resources lost in Chile in the 19th century is still as lively as the desire to ride over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court to meet on October 1 after five-year consultations.
“Bolivia has the vibration, a spirit of unity and calmness and, of course, expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will pursue the judgment of the IGH on large screens, hoping that the court in the Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand, according to which, after decades of sporadic talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea of Bolivia.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who will face a controversial fight for his re-election next year, there is also a lot in the game on Monday’s judgment.
“We’re just in front of returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The United Nations Authority with its headquarters in the Netherlands is not authorized to comply with Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, that the court’s judgment has been present for six months after the final prosecutor, concludes that the case was “not complicated”.
A long way away from supporting the case of Bolivia, the last four years could also mean a retreat.
“The current Bolivian government has removed the issue of access to the sea itself,” Zárate said.
She suggested that Morales's military rhetoric has overthrown any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will sometime continue their conversations, but after these events it will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in the Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia has “a extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and “a chance to end disputes during 139 years for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political crack.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific," he added.
“Judge is a chance to recognize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear destruction only takes place if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never first equip its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the rivals’ heads of state in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ahead of the summit with North Korean Head of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore, bringing the firm nuclear diplomacy back in place.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and US resistance against a declaration of ending the Korean war would ever force the North to knee as a "hirngespinst".
Washington is skeptical and wants to disagree with the declaration without Pyongyang to take essential dismantling steps first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, widespread skepsis rules that Pjöngjang is seriously meant by abandoning an arsenal, where the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion views in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hut collection or display the sun completely, you no longer have to look for.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy over-sized head covers for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely unpleasant cottages have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their fascinating creations over the course.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige-colored hat with a federative wide edge that just pushed the heads of the models.
As other overdimensional accessories, water melons, a magical hot and even an ananas were shown with jewelry, but these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were supplied with narrowed lips and had more similarity to Hannibal Lecter than with skin couture.
A creation looked like a diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice.
And if you want to put another gigantic modestatement, you have luck.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional cabins follow directly on “La Bomba”, the 60-centimeter-width stroh hut, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult table behind the extremely unpractice hut, which hit big waves in social media, sent another big creation over the ladder: a beach bag made of stroh that was almost as large as the model wearing a bathrobe that held the bag.
The bass bag in red orange with bastards and a white leather ring was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large cottages and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has so excited that the demand for overdimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language Knowledge for World Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence, which continued with further outstanding examination results in 2018 and is only underpined by individual and common successes in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to take care of their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak to someone in a language that he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, then you reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current examination results of this year, we realize that languages with the highest rates of existence are at the top of the ranking lists of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages obtained Note A in the higher exams.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved Note A at the higher exams, while 72 percent of the students who studied German, 69 percent of the students who studied French, and 63 percent of the students who studied Spanish also achieved Note A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will certainly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are now considered as electoral fields as STEM fields (natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and other places.
According to a 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey, 17 percent of the reasons employers called the problems of occupying open jobs were related to a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly required when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
Since more and more open places require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically provide a prejudice to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct an entertainment, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today’s children to invest now in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught as the most important for the United Kingdom, such as Mandarin or Japanese, by 2020.
Wherever your child’s interests are, in independent schools, a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers will always be chosen.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be seen that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
Actually, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers-Debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James coming for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, the waiting will soon end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the San Diego Denver Nuggets on Sunday in the predecessor's opening game.
How many minutes will he play, however, it is not yet fixed.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked after training after his plans for the Lakers’ predecessor plan for the six matches.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me,” he said.
Time for Trump's customer service in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five customer relationships planned next week, including well-pleasing places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the sharp vote on the confirmation of his elections for vacation at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming semester elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk to lose control over Congress.
When will Trump’s customer service in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's customer service in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's customer service in West Virginia below as live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh hearings on allegations of sexual misbehavior led in an intense atmosphere this week. The expected Senate vote on confirmation remains in silence up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this customer service series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in November.
Hence, President Trump’s election team told Reuters that these five customer relationships would serve to mobilize volunteers and followers next week, while Republicans try to retain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.
“Control over the Congress is as important for his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible while the operational election season is coming,” a Trump election spokesman who did not want to name his name told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, customers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and reporting media from Pittsburgh could participate in the scheduled customer service at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling for this evening.
Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump attempts to support the retreating Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him an impulse in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows fighting ready to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three unilateral rounds, the four parties on Saturday morning could be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pencil of the momentum is a pure invention as a sporting concept, but that is especially in competitions like this.
Where is the momentum of your opinion now?
“They were in leadership with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that this means a small moment for us,” Jordan Spieth said when he left the game.
Of course, Europe is in favour and stands in front of four points, while twelve follow-ups are further.
However, according to Spieth, Americans feel some wind in their sail and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show up three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from rain to green and goes forward with a good example.
The good-speaking enthusiasm shouted in the next course of his round when he cut an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had retreated two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, uncovered a similar shout that makes it clear that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really have to get rid of myself and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for the individual players.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, and thereby uncertainly written the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unlikely but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and nothing can do wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who hadn't beat Bogey on Saturday morning, but they also had avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the nine holes behind Bogey on Friday morning.
This series and apparently the flowing energy between them and the amount of excreted undermines that they are the players to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who sealed a possible European victory when the sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-morrow hero who played with Alex Noren.
One Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and the Swedish into a climb that they could not overcome nearly.
But on Sunday, no one can help them out of the climb.
The four and four pairs are as fascinating as the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or not, and the way a strategy can change quickly, as fascinating as it looks closely.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in leadership on the last day, but this four-round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the U.S., had doubted.
Europe will be in leadership on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the four and four parties from Saturday, Europe is facing the United States at 10:6 and is going with a solid prejudice in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The genially playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the Tiger Woods that struggles with difficulties, and thereby scored four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to regain the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four in the morning against the misleading American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but the remainder was unable to recover.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 individuals played on Sunday to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in consecutive as the first European newborn, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend “Molliwood”, only won four points in their four opening matches as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four, they harmonize outstandingly and beat the stunned Woods and American newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more striking 5&4.
Woods, who had climbed through two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance shine, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four parties and seven in consequence.
Justin Rose, who had been resting during the fourth morning, returned and played the four parties as partner of Henrik Stenson. She won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and third in the world.
However, for Europe, on this pleasant vintage day southwest of Paris, it did not run all according to their ideas.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put two points on Saturday to the Americans.
In the four, they won a 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and struck Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four and three four parties after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only two times a team came back after it had gone to the individual with a residue of four points, but as a title holder, Furyk's team is enough to keep the trophy.
After they have been in second place for two days, it doesn’t seem like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea Rejects Single-Side Destruction Without Trust
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their lack of trust against the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “essential measures for good will last year,” for example, it stopped nuclear and missile tests, decomposing nuclear testing sites and committed itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never be disrupted unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach in the denuclearization, where North Korea would reward for successive steps, his statement seemed significant as it had not rejected a unilateral denuclearization in advance, as it did in the past Pjöngjang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had assured to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump pledged security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea seeks an official end of the Korean war led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands after a locking of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. stands on “first denuclearization” and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by forced, and are even opposed to the “declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knees is a brain stroke of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our misconfidence.”
Ri did not go on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which had highlighted the U.S. chief at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister said at three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in in in the past five months: “If South Korea would have been the other party in the question of denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this stand.”
However, the sound of Ris Rede differed enormously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korean missiles on the continent of the United States after the "bad president" Trump Kim had called Kim "raketerman" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened North Korea's "full destruction" last year, overthrew Kim with praise to the United Nations for his courage in terms of debris steps, but said that there is still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must certainly be continued to be energetic until we have reached the complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to finance Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn’t successful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress has been achieved to be charged by North Korea for hours later, he has put "small demands."
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon, a missile base and a nuclear complex when the United States took “compliant measures”.
He said Kim told him that the planned “compliant measures” are security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students in this year’s primary study get more sleep. This is a measure against the spreading machoculture, keeping awake with caffeine and learning throughout the night.
A scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to introduce the course to life after having held a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“A girl finally came to me and asked, ‘Why am I still experiencing this in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The first course this year explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after she found students suffered under severe sleepout during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books, with information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleep shortages on the sporting performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleeping withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, and cancer.
They will then be encouraged to reflect on their daily routine using a map of the university’s field with interactive symbols.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe that you have the right to know this – just how you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” said Professor Czeisler.
The pride of shaking a night layer was still widespread, he said, and added that modern technologies and the increasing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Ensure good sleep, the “secret weapon” of all students should be against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said. Also, it was possible to avoid weight gain as sleeping extraction puts the brain into the hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who studied chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course in his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study program before taking their study at the competition-oriented university.
According to Professor Czeisler’s recommendation, students should wake up for sleep and awakening and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that can come out of electronic screens and LED lights and bring the zircodian rhythm out of the takt. This leads to sleeping problems.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forced Gerrards players
The Rangers lost another outer game when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrards matched a 0:1 match at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win its first outward victory since St. Johnstone's 4:1 triumph, but Gary Holts team added the second defeat only in 18 games as manager, so his team remains eight points behind the leading hearts at Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-time, and the inspirational Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and lies only behind Hibernian.
The Rangers also threatened further troubles after Calum Spence had to be treated by an apparent object thrown out of the guest block due to a head wound.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, over-old Ayr and reached the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
On the contrary, Holt remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts a point last week, and had to be excited about how his well-trained team kept his opponent under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
After just two minutes, they had to get a door when Mengas first release led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's door, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot behind him.
Then a long freelancer of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow was able to shoot only on the back.
The Rangers took control, but their game acted more hopefully in the last third than convincing.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously convinced that after a quarter of an hour he had to have been criminalized due to a conflict between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not allow the complaints of the Colombian.
The Rangers reached only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox tower guard Liam Kelly had hardly difficulty with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit in the 34th minute may not match the game history, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball on Scott Robinson, who kept the rest and searched for Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted in the meantime and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost instant effect when the wing player Morelos introduced in position, but the impressive Kelly hurried from his line to block the ball.
Nevertheless, Livingston continued to play the exact game for them, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stayed well standing and defeated Jacobs before Lithgow passed a headball out of the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also later demanded a punishment for a crowd of Jacobs, but Thomson saw again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning German: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger Counter.
The Geiger Counter, which has become a standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that in the whole world?”
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you set these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.”
Evans: "In fact, I hear a knife!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
The invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” depleted cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy depleted cells.
The vaccine contributes to the immune system to detect depleted cells in the course of treatment.
The method removes immune cells that are modified in the laboratory to a patient.
These cells can see a lot of common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can see the many types of cancer common protein HER2, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, as explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which patients take immune cells and are taught to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a leukemia type.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump Tirade after his appearance at SNL, carrying a MAGA Cup (Make America Great Again).
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was released at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had widespreadly praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wanted to join in 2020 as a presidential candidate.
After he sang his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-American Great Again Cup, he continued with a sharp canoe against the Democrats and again emphasized his support for Trump.
“White people ask me so often, ‘How can you like Trump?’ he’s racist.
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
SNL started the broadcast with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made a funny statement about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Justice Committee on the charges raised by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual disturbance.
Although the recording of West’s schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the publication over the West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the scene due to his head covering.
“They’ve scanned me behind the scene.
They said, “Don’t go out with the cap.”
You've scanned me!
And then they say that I am in a contaminated area,” he said.
West continued: “Do you want to see the polluted area?” He said, “He will wear my supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. Do you want it to move forward with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments were out of the audience at least twice, and SNL employees were harmful, according to Variety. One person said, “It was deadly in the studio.”
West was forced to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture of the title "I Love it", with which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: DANKE, THIS IS THE MASSE ENGAGEMENT HAST.”
But talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want someone who makes himself and gives himself a bad ideology to my community (if I buy his music or his clothes or support his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (the officially known as Kanye West beings).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course changed Prince, the deceased musician, his name into a symbol and then into "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (the formerly known as Prince).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBOs characterized by the medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the macho hero's stereotype. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling needed to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who also participated in Game of Thrones, admitted that the solution to the problem is “very important.”
“I personally find the question very important at the moment what was wrong with maleness,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we’re watching now?”
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very male characters.
He continued, “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught in television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to incorporate this particular side of a man?
I really think this is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change this?
For there has been something wrong with the young men.”
In addition, in the interview, he admitted that after the end of the series in the next summer he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones" but had "a lot of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington is seen in a new edition of Sam Shepards True West, the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The actress recently admits that the best for him was "Game of Thrones" that he had met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in this mission, so I have received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantastic series Ygritte with many Emmys, Harington's character Jon Snow.
They married Leslies family property in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% rise in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases have been reported.
Unlike the past, the transfer took place in the vast majority of new cases by sexual intercourse.
Until now, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has almost been reduced to zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in comparison with the annual number of people living with HIV and AIDS, China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT community members should be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men are finally married to women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argued that employees allowed GOP senators to scan data, criticize "dangerous lies" and "conciliation theories"
Maxine Waters, MP at the U.S. House of Representatives, filed claims on Saturday, a member of its staff published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles stated that the allegations would be spread by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more deceptionful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate committee on the charges against the Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh made by an unknown person in the government district.
The release took place after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts is associated with Waters’ Office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unreasonable charge is completely wrong and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false charges – was in no way responsible for searching for this information.
This unreasonable accusation is totally wrong and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly solved online criticism, including Ari Fleischer’s, an ex-press spokesman of the White House.
“This dementia is angry,” Mesher wrote.
“This concludes that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they haven’t done shouldn’t be angry.
You shouldn't be sad.
You should not question the causes of the prosecutor.
You must be quiet and quiet.”
Waters’ response seemed to compare the criticism of the Democrats to judge Kavanaugh, which was accused by critics during the hearing on Thursday to have acted too angry.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is coming to dismiss Waters in the mid-term election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a big thing if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the criminals are revealed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
“Johnny English – Man Lives Only Three times” – weak spion parish with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for a new film in every British colored Brexit reference. This also appears to apply to this revival of the action comedy parish "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English - The Spion That Promised" and 2011 with "Johnny English - Now Only Right"
Will an ironical self-parish, as we are obviously arguing, become the new export potential for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glossy, cutting grimasts and inkompetent Johnny English has been extended for the second time, signaling his name more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinematic sugars in non-english space.
Of course, he is again the conquered secret agent who seems strange to be cool and world-wide, while he actually consists of something Clouseau, a Prize Mr. Bean and a click of this man who has contributed to the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner" at the opening of the 2012 Olympics in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind leaving travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the forgotten Barclaycard television spots.
Johnny English’s last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter in a medieval army and the rotor leaves briefly climbed to his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comics occurs later, but the humor seems quite weak and strange overflowing, especially because the “serious” film series such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” now offer self-certain comedian elements.
The humor appears to be more focused on children than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mischief is not as incredible and focused as Atkinson's fool film gags in the role of Bean.
The eternity premise is that the UK is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very to the failure of the service agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strohhal for the Prime Minister, a blown and disturbed figure, which is already due to her political inpopularity before the full collapse: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi Teresa May character, but the script does not give a lot to work with.
Your secretariat advisers inform you that all active spies have been removed and therefore you have to take someone out of retirement.
This includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a sending facility, but has an informal lesson in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, as English offers an academy of spion memory of the School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall to an emergency meeting and reconciled with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, whose role is Vicki Pepperdine a little confused.
So, Batman and Robin, who always make everything terriblely wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are back in action, when they meet Olga Kurylenkos of beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is at risk in the bans of a charismatic tech billionaire, the window Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of the UK.
English and Bough start their Odyssey of the Gross Late: As Kellner dresses, they put a spectacular French restaurant in fire, they take care of chaos when they dive on board Voltas’ luxury yacht, and English solves pure anarchy when he tries to make himself using a virtual reality home headset with Voltas’ inner headset.
In this last sequence, although all records are drawn, but it is so sympathetic and funny, the topic is already discussed in detail on children's television.
Very moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson really play a role that will meet his talent?”
Labour strives to work on a plan that Brits work four days a week, but should be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party plans to take into account a radical plan that predicts the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
The party wants reports that corporate managers share the savings achieved by the KI Revolution (Artificial Intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
This means that the employees will have a three-day weekend, but still get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea “fits” to the party’s economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was promoted by the Trade Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“A change will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is consistent with the party’s approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and the party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “It’s not a four-day week of party policy and it’s not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concreted his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profits” from public supply companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retreat their entire share, as a labour government could "release" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the plans to call employees to the boards of companies and establish inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private companies’ own capital to employees who cash up to 500 pounds per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy expressed in the newspaper “60 minutes” whether the FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has moved a vote on his appointment to judge at the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the results of the Authority could influence Republican Senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring something day to day, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said in the interview that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
Then I called on him, the claim was expressed, and asked if he did it.
He was determined, determined, and incomprehensible.”
However, Graham's voice seems to be stoned.
“My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it should be a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know: Brett has disputed this vehemently,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone who called her couldn’t confirm it.”
It's now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York City, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of Stars and an equally impressive mission to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place for the seventh time this year, to experience not only Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes’ performances, but also to strengthen awareness of the actual goal of the event: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international group of stakeholders tries to fight poverty by increasingly motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to carry out a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteer work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – fighting poverty.
How successful is the project being taken into account that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of providing a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called Clicktivism – if you think to change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen has reported that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve different goals.
These actions have helped encourage world-wide politicians to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion were already paid or received by fundraising.
According to estimates, the secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the UK who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda fight under-nutrition in the country with $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions called for Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding of the project The Power of Nutrition to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutritional interventions.
As a response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They said, “There will be a long and hard way with heights and depths.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists attending this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
U.S. could use navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports
According to Washington Examine, Washington can use the navy if necessary to prevent energy from reaching the markets from Russia, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently working on the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
“I think the true reason for the use of Russia in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in the energy sector, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are means and ways to handle this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is understood as the “Stim of the Power Consumer” in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington’s approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuel is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said while calling Russia “One Trick Pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was planning to expand the exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, became the "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters to be an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy is not to be used as a means of pressure and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federal Association of the German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stand out from the EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” the board of directors of BDI Dieter Kempf said after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a presidential candidate for 2020 “to be accurately reviewed,” says Senator for Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check out exactly a presidential candidate after the interim elections."
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to examine a presidential candidate after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is heading this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m extremely worried about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren, in his criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, did not take a sheet.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course, an FBI investigation is required.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters did not believe that they should apply for 2020.
According to a survey from the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts reported that the Senate should not apply.
32% of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate by former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who support a potential candidate, and 48 percent who oppose.
The other names of prominent Democrats who are questioning for a possible 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden reported that he would officially decide until January.
Sarah Palin expresses himself on Donald Trump’s rally for posttraumatic load disturbance under track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son does when he returns, that can all feel other families that feel the effects of the PTBS and part of the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an elephant in the room and said about her son and other war veterans that she changed to return, that they would return shorterly, that they would come back and wonder whether there was such respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other military member gave to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused a woman of domestic violence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police office of Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support new asylum policy aid
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy that deny victims of band activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district issued a lawsuit on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who questioned the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace Against Session complaint, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against the Federal Policy in August, was not announced.
She said her partner “and his violent band sons” had abused them, but US officials rejected their asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys, who support Grace, called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people make an asylum application in the United States as nations who are faced with major problems with criminal bands and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy raised a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum to escape from domestic violence.
Attorney general of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "discovered tens of laws at state, union and international level".
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the relevant facts and circumstances of the application, and that court violates this principle," the Court's statement said.
In addition, lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse access to the country would adversely affect the economy in the United States, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour forces.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges who fled from domestic violence and criminal band violence to no longer grant asylum.
"There is asylum for everyone who leaves their home country because they are persecuted or because of fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
It was never planned to deter all problems by granting asylum, even all serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths doubled over time
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly worse.
“It’s all very excited,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, quieting her little fevering son in a rescue center in the devastated city centre of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is short."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to gather their neighbouring possessions and goods and to hide everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and employees of the hospitals injured by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spinal breaches and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the ongoing severe abuses.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and his daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was climbed under the fallen walls,” he told the Associated Press, and added that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s rescue calls, but then there was calm.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they’re in a safe place.”
U.S. ambassadors complain to China of tyranny with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had unveiled a four-page announcement in an American newspaper announced the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Peking of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump went on a charge last Wednesday to China Daily’s paid attachment to the Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa after he accused China of interfering in the U.S. Congress Elections on November 6.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing has attempted to interfere in the US elections correspond to the US officials’ statement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign caused by Washington to exercise pressure on China.
While it is common that foreign governments turn advertisements to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an outstanding trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese taxation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries like Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, who exports largely agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing workers, owners of agricultural farms and companies have damaged.
China, according to Branstad in a commentary in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubled this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the proven tradition of free expression and independent press in America by closing the country’s paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, you will only find the newspapers in Beijing in a limited number of opposition votes and find no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the worrying economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer for publication of his article, but he did not call the name of the newspaper.
Republican voters seize the debacle for Kavanaugh before the interim elections, observers warn
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several charges of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the upcoming interim elections, particularly women.
The mood in this context was extremely stressed, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they continue with a vote.
“You can’t reject such things,” said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute strike by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) is sufficient for an FBI investigation to employ angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not even in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first advisor and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate's fluir area called "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold Kavanaugh's nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially in voters in the predecessors and in younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement, in which their accusations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court, observers stated that a counter-reaction could be a consequence if the Republicans make the confirmation.
“This situation is a serious breakthrough for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the board’s vote, the final vote or Kavanaugh’s review, but it’s also about how Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group supporting the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be inconsistent with who they should believe because of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly bigger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitively or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% suggested that they were definitively or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitively lied in his statement, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week before the Senate's Justice Committee, Ford issued a state statement that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had deployed her genitalia when they were at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently brings a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who accesses information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made it the best that the intention behind Inrupt was the “Weltherrschaft”.
“We need to be active now,” he said on the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business area.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content in a browser are available at the same time.
The particular thing in the personal online data storage is that the user can decide only who can access the data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been employed to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralized apps worldwide with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not share with Facebook and Google on whether a comprehensive change would be made in which their entire business models would be completely remodeled overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian crisis in the First World War, was honored
The only spiritist of the Church of England, awarded as a fighter to the Victorian cruise during the First World War, was honoured 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Bernard Vann won the award for his efforts to attack Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sharp shooter and never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren uncovered a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed just 100 years after the hero's birthday, for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense nebula and under a heavy load of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he urged the fire line and led the line forward with the "largest tapperness" before he was pre-elected with a field weapon at the single entrance and disabled three of the military units.
Lieutenant Vann was shot on 4 October 1918 by a German sharp shooter; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never justify, and at the same time something that makes a humble.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he put a crown in the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that a true hero’s tactics would be visible mainly by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine that you've been awake all night to see an exciting Bellator 206 and then you can't see the main event.
San Jose's bill contained 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the spectators in the United Kingdom weren’t surprised to see Peppa Pig.
Some remained un touched after they stayed awake until early morning hours to see the battle specifically.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the trick movie figure as a somewhat bad joke.
“Due to a government regulation, these contents are classified as not youth-free, so it had to be changed to a child broadcast at 6 p.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in Marketing and Communications at Bellator when he was questioned about the transmission.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
The company’s CEO, Scott Coker, said the company would edit the schedule to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved already in the repetition game,” he said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday with the visitors in the UK, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay on it.
At the time of the change, a lot was communicated. It went very nicely and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have thought it was a technical disturbance.
What wasn’t the case, it was a problem by the government.
I promise that this will not happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to provide the fans with the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "because of sexuality"
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic Games, says he has grown up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old said he had only realized at the school he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to encourage others.
He also said since he became a father, the wins in the Olympics are no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, has stopped for a few months.
In Laverne's first broadcast, he said he considered himself less than any other, since love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said, “Today is the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others, the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation was known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympics today is a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had expressed himself on this subject because, fortunately, he could live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to make others bold.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he told him that the age difference would never have been a subject.
He says that if you had to do so much as a child and youth – he took part in the Olympics for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley thinks that all of his views have changed since.
Last year, everything had been around gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympia Gold Medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the nearby death, and one of the last things he asked for were the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be with them.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I only knew that it was always my dream of dancing at the Olympics in front of the home audience – that was the madness,” he said.
His first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this, he heard the song in advance of the Olympics and still took care of the skin of Ghana.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort to prevent the whole from becoming a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays the 12th time at the event, was sent to the substitute bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event, the five-time major winner spent his day shooting others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that burden him.
Even at the highest point of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where missing balls are being punished regularly.
And as if the place itself isn't upset enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Newling in these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points left a hot start at the 12 single games, Mickelson’s game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk spoke confidently to Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was perfectly aware of his current role in the clearance, gave me a knap on his back and laid his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-renowned personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I hadn't thought he was there in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went now and that’s what we’ve expected.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games held on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race, which never completely corresponds to the top points of his personal record.
Mickelson could record 18 wins, had to enter 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk reported that he had enriched his presence alone.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original, and he likes to make a few late, and he's a great man who is popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to meet him somewhat closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over with the progression soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big progression that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Denmark debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point predecessor against the Americans, but only shortly passed the target line and led with the smallest possible predecessor, with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The idea remains that we had a big progression in Valderrama, we had a big progression in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but it’s hardly that,” Bjørn said after seeing the 5–3 win of the class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, leading to 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows to me and to all the team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow it's going to be right.
Put yourself into the property and do exactly what is right.
The whole ends only when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s faced with us on the other hand: the best players in the world.”
Bjorn continued: “I would never break it down.
Tomorrow there will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual services are at the forefront and this is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when things work well, but if you’re alone out there, you’ll be tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You need to make it clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you, and he must also take out his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those great returns on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brookline on the winner side before he stood on the sides of the losers to Europe's "Wunder of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as much as we feel, you know, we're trying to witch tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task to win the counter, he must play in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking list.
“I have chosen for the guys in this order because I believe it covers everything,” Bjorn said about his choice for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The newest fregatte of the German Navy had already been put into service in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War coming in the years, but it is delivered by local media due to defect systems and rapidly growing costs only early next year.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the brand-new fregattens of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time called for a military spokesman.
The ship had already been put in service in 2014, but the ambitious project had been planned for worrying issues after delivery.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, already ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old fregates of the Bremen-Class.
They are designed to include a powerful canoe, a series of airfighting missiles and sea target aircraft, as well as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods, and it should be possible that the latest fregates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can lead to the modern warships, which are intended to represent Germany as a sea power, to be already obsolete at the time of their operation.
Fregatte F125, persecuted by the disaster, went into the strikes last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Werft Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship after its delivery to the fireplace.
There was little known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a series of significant “software and hardware errors” that would have made the new ship useless in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly severe as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by an occupation of only 120 marines, just about half as much as on the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to invasion of power and prevents the navy from carrying out equipment measures in the future.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" seemed to be twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
The cost seemed to rise to amazing €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion planned.
The problems with the latest fregatten are particularly important in view of the recent warnings that the German Sea force is screwing.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Vice-Official Officer of the German Bundestage, confirmed that the Navy “departed from the useable ships”.
Bartels said that the problem was growing over time since old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust reveals the secret life of the mouse
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are conducted to show how flour mouse uses the landscape in the food search.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying breastfeeders and help lead future natural protection activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will track sweat and mushroom mouse as well as the brown Langohr and water mouse in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed on key positions on the ground to record the activities of the floating mice throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In an analysis of noise of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the flour screws is determined and determines what species does.
Then a map and a report of the living room will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of living are the most important for the flour mice and how they are used by any species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of living space management measures, such as the creation of grains, and to show how to obtain forest areas for flour mice and other related species.
The flood stocks in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect sleeping places and lead to loss of living space.
Wind wheels and lighting may also pose a risk, as well as flyers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by cats.
The mouse isn't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their night hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching fat.
They use an exhausted test to detect insects and obstacles on their plane.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland takes the theme of flood mouse very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleepplaces and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only fleet mouse reserve in the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 fleet mouse species.
Good manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal living room for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for flour mouse,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living room.
But there’s a lot that we don’t know about the mouse yet, so here and to other goods we do these works that will help us learn more about what the mouse needs to feel comfortable.”
He emphasizes how important it is to exclude first the presence of flour mice from maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the undesirable destruction of a single niche place could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire population on site.
The mouse is protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their nipples.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains, “We still have to learn a lot about flour mice, and in many of our species we don’t know how it’s about their populations.”
Ronaldo contests prosecution while his lawyers want to accuse the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called him a “fake news” and said that people want to be “famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to accuse the news magazine The Mirror that published the charges.
The storm of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claimed to pay her $375,000 later to purchase her silence for the incident, according to The Mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “Fake News” only hours after their publication.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they have reported today: Fake News,” the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or said in the camera.
“You want to profile by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous for my name, but that's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything’s fine,” the player smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to accuse the mirror due to the allegations that they referred to by Reuters as “unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage at a level that corresponds to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event was expected to take place in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After having met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga claimed to go to the player's room where he raped them according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” to “one percent.”
The documents claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was agreed.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to police and had made photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later admitted to an extrajudicial agreement as she had “anxiety of paying” and cared for being “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to cancel the agreement as she was still traumatised due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo, at the time of the alleged incident, moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid and moved this summer into a €100 million heavy deal to Italian gigantic Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘repent’ the loss of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would “eternally regret it” if it loses its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Economic Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbed" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston factory at Derby, Britain should leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at the border in a non-deal Brexit could lead to loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s product lines Auris and Avensis were manufactured last year, manufactured nearly 150,000 vehicles, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience an uncontrolled Brexit production stop at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also made concerns about a harsh EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says it will close its mini-work in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to automakers, are associated with risks within the supply chain with a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing plant is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, it could come to the limits of interruptions that could lead to delays and delays in the parts, according to the industry.
It is impossible for Toyota to carry out a warehouse in the Derbyshire factory that lasts longer than a day, the company said.
Theresa May’s Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU “is designed to avoid such controls at the border.”
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio Today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not indicate how long production would be interrupted, but in the long run warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to losses of workplace.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite Union in the work, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience will never come back again when they’re just gone.
One government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s planned meeting with Rosenstein could be relocated, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could “move another week,” while the dispute about the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued on Sunday, said it was out of the White House.
Rosenstein has investigated the supervision of the work of Special Detective Robert Mueller, who investigated the election interference by Russia, connections between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as possible justice disability by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Vice-Justice Minister and thus threaten Mueller’s independence has been subject to rumors in Washington for a month.
In the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump as well as the President’s dismissal by means of the 25th constitutional appendix.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports on his alleged resignation were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid colliding with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, said.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump’s press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
To a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not been set for it yet, and it could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be moved in another week, taking into account all the things that are just going to the Supreme Court.
This will show up, but I always like to keep the press on running."
Some reporters would probably object to this claim: Sanders has no longer held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences did not lie in a denial to the TV reporter's "effectus" but said, "I wouldn't object to the fact that they are doing effecttus."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more questions and answers rounds than any president before him," she said, without providing accurate evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders, however, “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, but much better than to talk to me.
We try to do so often, and you have seen that we have done so often in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he rejected a raging and sometimes strange appearance before meeting reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU employees of the Scottish NHS for Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addresses people from the EU who work in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and the desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already stated ready to bear the costs for EU citizens who work in the decentralized public service of Scotland.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the departure negotiations between the UK and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible non-deal scenario.
I know what anxiety times this must be for all of you.
That is why I once again wanted to express how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Co-workers from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and thus benefit the patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is full and full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was injured after an emergency operation
The Linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was undergoing an emergency operation, according to Mike Organ by Tennessee State after a head injury that he took on Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, headquarters of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the semi-pause.
“He came to the sideline and just broke out there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before it was placed on a carriage and transported for further investigations.
A spokesman of Tennessee State Chris Harris told WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details about the nature or extent of the injury yet” and Tennessee State attempts to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after switching to Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchase in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to make a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. Additional revenues will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party homeless
This step is to end Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects more than £120 million per year to help homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee when buying real estate in the UK, while the majority of income will benefit homelessly.
This step represents an attempt to reassure Jeremy Corbyn's success in young voters, who promise to provide more affordable living space and to take top earners in visibility.
The increase in stamp tax will be raised on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenues will be made to the government campaign against homelessness.
The charge, which is raised in addition to the current stamp tax, including the increase in second apartments and rented real estate, two years ago, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance estimates the step with more revenue of up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built real estate in London are purchased by investors not based in the United Kingdom, which will drive prices to the sum and make it difficult for first-time buyers to walk in real estate business.
Many wealthy territories of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spiritual cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has pledged for a reduction in stamp tax to allow more young people to have their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping the real estate prices high by purchasing land without using it, and forced Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's "restaurable spatial crash".
The opposition leader Corbyn announced an overwhelming series of proposals for residential reforms, ranging from a rental price commitment to banning spaces without a tricky reason.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in building new apartments.
May said: “Last year I told you that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to the recovery of the British dream, according to which the life of generation to generation should be improved.
And that is to repair our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as well as for businesses with headquarters abroad to buy real estate as for British citizens who work hard.
The dream of the home has become too far for many people, and the uncertainty of homelessness remains a too big problem.”
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, boss of Sunderland, says that it is his “great goal” to become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of hitting the new life of Northeastern England, which is right on third place in the League One and missing the three points at the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after taking St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got it on the bank and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound broadcast.
“But when I was a child, I often saw Scotland playing in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me away.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in association management.”
Ross predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic told him not to be afraid to enter the footsteps of such a established name in such a club after he had previously refused offerings from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured with me at the moment by whether I can bring the association back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this association, he certainly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would just consider my time here as a success if I brought the association back there.”
Ross can only have a three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month work as coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and took St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels better than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This was probably a real divorce,” he recalls when he assumed the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird as I didn't work badly, could live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I always wanted to manage it and now I do it. I never felt so comfortable in my skin throughout my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, according to a study
The heat wave in the summer has missed the revenue of British crashing pubs, while restaurant chains fell under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded a sales growth of 2.7% in July, but the revenue at restaurants declined by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin by the company’s CGA advisory, who compiled the figures, said: “Continuing sunlight and England’s ongoing participation in the football world championship longer than expected, meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, where pubs’ sales increased by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurant was even harder.
The decline of 1.8%, recorded by the restaurant industry in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverages showed the best performance, with a surface-tailored sales development, which increased higher than they dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs with emphasis on food also suffered in the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the beverage rates increased by 6.6 per cent a month, while the sale of food decreased by three per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for the RSM recreational and guesthouse competition, said: “These results continue the trend we have been watching since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales incursions of 4.8% will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure of the previous year.
The long, hot summer would not be able to come at any worse time for business operators with a focus on food and it remains to wait for the more moderate temperatures to provide the urgent breathtaking in August.”
The overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, amounted to 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry monitor Coffer Peach tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant area in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined sales of over £9 billion and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide it from their parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students at further schools has found an increase in so-called Fake Insta pages
The message emphasizes fears that sexual content is posted
Twenty-five percent of students suggested to own a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at further schools showed a rapid increase in so-called Fake Insta accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing website.
The message emphasizes fears that sexual content is shared.
Twenty-five percent of students said they would own a clean “main account” that they could show to their parents, but also own private accounts.
A mother who hit her 13-year-old daughter’s secret side found a teenager who urged the other to “rape me.”
The study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of the independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half admitting to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, HMC Chairman, said: “It’s disruptive that so many teenagers will be deprived of creating online rooms where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the “Stimme of the Athletes” in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to be a non-executive member of the Council of the Scottish Athletics Association.
Doyle is Scotland’s most commonly excellent body athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports players to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh will be respected in the Scotland, Britain and the world’s body athletics community and we are sure that the body athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from their choice in the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I look forward to working as a voice of athletes and hope I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the distance of over 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, called his own, and often appears as a BBC expert today, was unable to run after a temporary flow disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me whether or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, I learned to run and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
Advertising for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertisement clip, in which breastfeeding mothers are compared with cow milk.
In order to introduce the world's first noise-powered milk pump, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a non-serious music video to emphasise the freedom that gives the pump to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow-filled shade in the background to a song that contains the text titles: “Yes, I milk, but you see no shit on me” or “If you haven’t noticed it, it’s not euter, it’s my breasts.”
In the refrain, it says, "Pomp it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has triggered a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video hit mixed reactions to viewers, many of whom say it is harmless to the "throws" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to a cow to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days of birth,” he said in a comment.
The milk pump of Elvie fits into a still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Truely traumatic for mother and baby.
“But hey, why don’t we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Another person added: "That's a real-time advertising."
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song "urcomic".
“I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterprete him.
This is a great product,” a person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertising that is aimed at mothers using milk pumps (often at work or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone with the discreet pumps danced in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the discovery that many women who use milk pumps indicate to feel like milk cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely noiseless, does not have any wires or threads and fits discreetly into a still-BH, which allows women to get the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a safe and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows, we wanted to focus on dairy pumps and all the challenges associated with them, while simultaneously presenting the incredible sense of freedom in a fun and understandable manner that allows the new pump.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump entered the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the Catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought quietly into a tent city on the Texan border
The number of internal migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things, because the hardened rhetoric and Trump’s actions have made it harder to submit children to nurses.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers were even illegal immigrants and now fear to become even a target for an expulsion when they sign up to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household should give their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Authority Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated before the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had complained about the care of uncompany minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the detained had no previous entries in the criminal record.
“From 80 percent of people who are either nursery themselves or members of a nursery’s household, are illegal in the country and a large portion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to deal with the cases of children faster, officials have adopted new rules that, according to employees of the accommodation in some children, require to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after the detention, which was previously standard.
Many will appear by video circuit and not personally to join an immigration judge for their legal status.
In case of negative decisions, the person is rapidly dismantled.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation employees, as well as reports that have been reported from the system in the last month that they are frightened and depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or explosive attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced in a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems that are easier to ignore due to the size of a child.
They also explained that traumas, in which many of the children already suffer, could be reinforced if they are brought to a tent without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish ‘Occupation Forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the Civil War is currently in the country in the eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign arms were illegally treated on Syrian ground with the claim of fighting against terrorism.
“They have to withdraw immediately and without condition,” he said.
Moualem insisted that the “war against terrorism” has almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" by both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising both the Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the country of war.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are met, and he accused "some Western countries" of "prolifering irrational fears" to keep refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable returns," he said.
“They are politicing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no construction aid for Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebellious town of Idlib represents the possibility of ahead of political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a widely established offensive of the Syrian armed forces supported by Russia to the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters of the al-Qaeda allied Nusra Front, will be “released”.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call for the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and draw the way to elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the Committee and said that its work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interventions.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators are expected to end his presidency prematurely, a resignation or a scandal.
This would certainly be “the most dramatic final of a presidency of all times.”
So far, there are no signs that the spectators were hungry.
Since 2014, CNN’s best broadcasting rates have doubled more than 1.05 million and MSNBC has almost doubled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led the inclusion rates with 3.5 million viewers at night with important news.

She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he brings me to laugh’,” Scovell told me.
Chaos has a value of entertainment.

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees before his house on the northern coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he climbed inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get rid of the screen, not when Judge Brett Kavanaugh was just before, speaking before the Senate’s Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at the game.
“I remember when we made all these crazy broadcasts at that time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Speakers fled the closest racing around seats in Congress at the interim elections
It is little surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly drawn borders of the electoral districts that led to two officials in the race to be around the same seat.
The newly signed pre-city district in Pittsburgh allows the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his headquarters in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is opposed to another official owner, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th old district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overwhelmed with the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were shot against the Constitution and manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district issued a sharp exchange of election funding between the large financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a widespread special election in March at the 18th state election district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade, and Trump won there with 20 percentage points.
Politist experts give the Democrats light leadership.
The U.S. examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then resigned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without striking great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team was a partner.
U.S. Foreign Ministry officials have decided to withdraw the leaders of all U.S. foreign delegations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Ministry in a statement early this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, criminal measures were considered estimated at $140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, including reductions of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that should follow a similar meeting last year and represented a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made clear that they wish the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now intended to be a spokesperson at the mid-October conference to put a sign of the importance of the Assembly’s government, according to diplomatic data.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives are silent and quietly returning to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new sharp communications or criminal measures from Washington.
John Bolton’s government spokeswoman rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to express themselves on the internal meetings under the condition of anonymity.
Their opinions were confirmed by one of the government’s close external analysts who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be the report of Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible justice disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s election team has conspired with Russia in its attack on American elections.
If the majority of Congress changes, Trump is confronted with an institution that forces him to be accountable, precisely at the time when he is ready to stand back before the voters; and possibly before a gender jury.
These are many ‘when’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or the case of his European Pendants, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we have to make decisions that will affect how long the battle will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a state strike against Hitler if the West had only managed to resist him and the Czechoslovakia would have supported him in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history turns around such reversals and the inconsistent march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several of these turnpoints.
What do we do if Trump leaves the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the devil's kitchen since last year, reporting that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculate about it that he was top-not suitable for the office.
Rosenstein demented the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly ordered FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed despite fake allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct in the office?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-elections for a congress forced Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to burn Sabbath cakes on the table with the hack cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remit against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will place it in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for bigger.
“This was an important point for us because Villareal is very good,” the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we went home with a point.
Maybe we could have won at the end, but a total uncertainty was probably a fair result.
They've probably dominated in the first half, but we've been angry in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a heavy game as they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year it was definitely difficult with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good on it; the training is good.
I hope we can look forward to the last season behind us and be successful.”
Fear of age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants knew exactly how to handle them, only a few talked to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the study of Nationwide said to talk to your spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance Department of Nationwide.
That's why you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be taken care of, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial adviser on board: Your adviser can also help you find a way to fund these expenditure.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-based life insurance to help cover these costs or self- insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Explore your legal documents: Explore legal disputes in the last minute.
If you have a pre-compliance so that you are entrusted with a familiar person to monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a full power for your finances.
You choose a familiar person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Man in Ilfracombe shoots several times with air guns
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shootings that occurred about 02:30 British times as "willkurd acts".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the resulting communication systems, helpers were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with strength 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district extending in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government district, an administration unit under the province, estimated 299.200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue in the Central Sulawesi economy, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel lake is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami who destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was encountered in 1996 by a tsunami who killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismical Pacific fire ring, and is regularly invaded by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the last years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatras issued a tsunami that struck 14 countries and cost 226,000 people to live in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the West Coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nia Islands before the coast of Sumatras.
2006: A earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shot down the southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island, and released a tsunami that hit the southern coast and demanded nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake with the strength of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake with the strength of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands before Sumatra and dissolved a tsunami up to 10 meters high, ruining a dozen villages and demanding about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake struck the government district Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died of collapsed buildings.
2018: The popular Indonesian island of Lombok encountered severe earthquakes and demanded more than 500 deaths on the northern side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily landed on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the office of the Vice President, was arrested due to allegations of body injury.
The 29-year-old palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested due to suspicion of domestic violence, disability of reporting domestic violence and resistance to state force, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, he took the phone to a known person when he wanted to consult the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in investigation prison at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 was raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where when he was asked for his petitioner with "Not guilty, absolutely sure," the network said.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A irregularities, which can be fined with up to a year of jail and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also put on the burden of a class B irregularity, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It’s not the first time that criminal complaints have been raised against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently negotiated before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability of reporting a crime and gun ownership in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend suggested that she hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she brought her son’s behavior back to a posttraumatic disturbance in Iraq as a result of his time.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a earthquake that struck the Indonesian island Sulawesi on Friday.
Beating with a strength of 7.5 solved a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks are interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just before the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the land.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal attorney demands rare death penalties for suspects in New York's terrorist attack
The federal attorney in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack in New York City, who cost eight human lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the building chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, while moving on a bike road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight offenders “destinably” and “consciously” added serious body injuries, according to the intentional statement for the claim of the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both accusations could be sentenced to death according to the court’s document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal prosecution court Saipov filed a prosecution in 22 points covering eight charges of murder in the background of organized crime, usually used by state attorneys in cases of organized crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires "fundamental planning and intentions", as the prosecutors, who described the nature, in Saipov, the act, as "abstract, cruel and corrupt".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses,” the statement explained.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the Southern District of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a lifelong freedom penalty in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who was accused of committing spying for the Soviet Union two years before the conspiracy.
Both Rosenbergs were arranged on June 19, 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, was born in the days and months after the assault of lack of regret, according to judicial documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the act after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, the prosecutor said.
According to police, he also asked to suspend the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders, Saipov, said they were “deceived of course” due to the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only extend the trauma that all stakeholders suffer, instead of accepting the guilt in exchange for a life-long freedom punishment without the possibility of dismissal,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defensive team had previously asked the accused not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party Deputy asks Nigel FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilise “the power of the people” today during a protest during the Tories Conference.
Ukip’s former party chief said politicians must “feel” the pressure of the Eurosceptics while a deputy of Theresa May’s party proposed that Farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative back banker Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "prepared out" if Farage would be Brexit minister.
The challenge faced by May in the reconciliation of its deeply broken party has been harder to participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit held in the city by members of your party who are for a stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister has problems with keeping Chequers’ compromise plan on the course despite attacks by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, she should continue to try to negotiate an agreement with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between her package and the chaos.
Bone explained at the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “Chequers on the Waste” belongs.
He proposed to appoint Farage to a peer and to transfer to him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for it, we would have been out,” he said.
Wellingborough said: “I will support the Brexit, but chequers belong to the waste.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We have not fought in the world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone claimed that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit supporter of the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please submit checkers and start listening.”
In a top message to May, she continued: ‘The Prime Minister keeps their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage said in a statement that politicians must ‘feel pressure’, they should be in the right place to deceive the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to deceive Brexit and so we’re here today to tell them, ‘cause you don’t come from it.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: “I want you to let our political class, which is just before to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will win us in the referendum and never come to rest as long as we are not independent, self-managing, proud of the United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before a two-hour customer service in the city centre.
A few activists banner of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party, launched on weekends.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, was funny about the tories that had security problems with a party app when the conference opened.
“That’s the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, exist for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“That’s a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘previously check’ the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November election, she will “see the presidential candidate” carefully.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic from Massachusetts on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts talked about their future.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican MPs in the Massachusetts parliament, Geoff Diehl, who was in 2016 Vice-President of Trump’s election team in Massachusetts.
She was the focus of speculations that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke since Trump’s office was her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to apply for the presidency.
Warren said that it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our ruined government and that includes women at the top.
Detention after death shots on LSU players Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of a deadly shooting on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference to arrest the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 in the morning Eastern Time.
They published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffers a shooting injury on the head and died due to this injury," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to Sport media portal 247s.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been on the murder and possession of a weapon and shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter large Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 startups in the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after his team has left his victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed at Lewis Hamilton's qualification on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's stallors would play a big role in the race.
From the Pole position Bottas got a good start and it was almost like he introduced Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and put Hamilton into traffic at the end of the driver’s field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overcame him after a short wheel on rail drive, where the Ferrari pilot released the inner side, with the risk to endure after two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the rear places of the field and lay seven on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then for a large part of the race the fastest, as he held on his tyres to quickly end and overcome Kimi raicons for fourth place.
Finally, he went into the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds while raicons ended as a fourth.
It was a difficult day since Valtteri had made an excellent performance all the weekend and how a real gentleman acted as he should leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory,” Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump was funny on Saturday at a election event on Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted not to transfer Christine Blasey Ford’s letter to the Supreme Court’s candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford spoke not directly to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that the Senate proceedings show that people are “common, unfair and unfair.”
“A thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see anger when you see people who are angry and common and unfair and unfair,” the president said.
“When you look at the leaks and say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
I wasn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, wait a minute, please.
We have it... No, we haven't published it," he added, following the Senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and was released early September, however, Feinstein disputes that the Leak comes from its office.
“I haven’t hid Dr. Ford’s accusations, I haven’t published your story,” Feinstein said.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I have rejected her request for secretity."
Her dementia seemed to haven’t come well with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I’m telling you one, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his ongoing defence of the Judge candidate, which is accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed that the Democrats would use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to restore power with all means.
You see the unity, the wickedness, they do not care about who they were injured when they are allowed to fall under the wheels to obtain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer reached two doors for the giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The giants went into leadership early with two gates, after encounters by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made a compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the giants.
Francois Bouchard was similar to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two gates secured the victory.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe who hit Dundee on Friday night 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous matches.
Dwyer’s opening storm took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation as Beauvillier built the leadership.
During this exciting opening phase, Sullivan returned the home team after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie went back to his compensation storm after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer assured the leadership of the giants before the half-time break when he reached his second door shortly before the end of the first half of the evening.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard regained with a power play driver in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen bring Dundee in the game for the first time late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth door after nearly half the second half.
The giants who now lost four of their last five games will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air Force died after he was sure hundreds of people escaped from the earthquake in a plane
A fleet in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to make an aircraft with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after the island of Sulawesi was shot down on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong seizures are still felt in the region and many people are caught under traumas in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save your lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his posts at the heavily changing control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was at the time on the starting line, could safely withdraw.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesman of the Indonesian Aviation Safety Service, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News said.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
He died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We have been deeply affected by this message,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand. The country's disaster protection authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the turmoil, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves with up to 6 meters of height have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is short.
“Supermarkets are overseen everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy now, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in an interview with the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to carry out all the tasks associated with evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was already shot by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports drone in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports drone missing after drone in Lagune
The airline, which conducted the flight that fell into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, reports a missing man after he initially claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the falling plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the aircraft had fallen into the water during the attempt of landing on Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, but they were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in Lagune just before the landing trail.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the landing trail.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to watch the emergency exits on the sides of the drone.
He said that the airline escorts panicked and cried and suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the improvement of a facility were eagled with an inflammatory boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane climbed into approximately 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in falls of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerns Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuild the course of the night when a woman was burned alive
The accusation concluded its evidence on Saturday in the new negotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, said for hours as an expert in the field of information assessment.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period when he said he had been at his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford came to the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s pick up that night, Sandford said he had lied, “that my pick up was in Nashville.”
Another objection was that Tellis indicated that Chambers had known two weeks at her death time.
However, mobile recordings suggested that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett told Tellis that some time after Chambers' death their news, calls, and contact information were deleted from his phone.
“He has deleted them from his life,” said Hale.
The defense is expected to begin on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will go to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that Hip Hop has removed his roots from the political message and social commitment.
They want to return to their roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the United Kingdom by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black?!
New York's child girl accuses couples of release for "racial" SMS
A New York girl accused a pair of discrimining release after she received a misguided message from her mother, in which she complained that she was "a still black."
The couple contested being racist and compared the dispute with a "expression".
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her anxiety when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she appeared her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NO WARNING,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After she recognized her Fauxpass, the “finely touched” Plasco-Flaxman Maurice released and claimed that the open African-American day mother had done bad work and instead expected a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Maurice now accuses the couple of compensation for the release and claims a compensation for the $350 per day, which she should have been reservationed for over six months for the job she originally but without a contract, and for which she had lived with the couple.
“I want to show them what you don’t do,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know that discrimination is.”
The couple rejected racism complaints and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had insulted them, could no longer be trusted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
“We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was unfaithful to them, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a “expression” and said that his wife was waiting for a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation”.
“Do you want to be interested in such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment bank added.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly convicted in the public and opposed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It is hard to enter someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our today’s knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the child book, had no problem with it, would have been rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of his release was "better sweet" last year.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddingtons she described as a "very important family member."
“He was a very quiet man and did not praise,” Jankel said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a child doing something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it really looks bad and that doctors gave her little chances,” said Ednan Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.”
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to you by the doctors to keep your heart pumping slowly fall down and leave your body.
She died shortly before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or shout because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to break up.”
Finally, Ednan Laperouse, who was sad about the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane along with the other passengers who had nothing to do with what she had done.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had cut my head and tears ran over my waves all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Distressed women hang on maps to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their relatives by a suicide attempt to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys on a bridge in Wales open maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for consulting sites.
Davi's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to have to feel as I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light a room.”
However, he announced his job before his death, because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I’m always afraid that this could have a consequence.”
Davis has designed the cards to show people that there are people to whom you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t stay quiet: you need to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was with 15 years after her mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she explained.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the children packed their gifts, he didn’t see them in their eyes or anything.”
She said that her death was a great trauma for her, but that they had to do so: “It is a huge hole in the family.
It breaks us.
But we all need to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the grave while the FBI starts investigating
“I thought if we could actually get something that he asked, that is, a timely and limited investigation, then maybe we could get some attention,” Flake said on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want FBI investigations?
Your rebellion can only be reversed to the time.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to vote their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush arrested the phone listener to call senators and convinced them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to decide on equal votes, and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overseers ‘sincrates’ under Kim
The number of North Korean overseers to South Korea has fallen in power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, a South Korean politician said.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that last year 1127 overseers were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices for human traffickers than major factors.
Pyongyang did not express it publicly.
The vast majority of northern overseers will eventually be offered to South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most fly over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China regards overseers rather than illegal immigrants and often brings them back with violence.
The relationships between the North and the South, which are technically still in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization negotiations set up.
This was due to the historical meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without relying on the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterial" and says he is not suitable for the office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said he was characteristicly inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t give up the impression that a woman who had acted in such a way would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented all allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he cried hardly and stood out in tears shortly before he talked about his family and high school time.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a “great and coordinated murder” organized by Liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton’s presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as she demonstrated that he was arrested against Democrats.
“I believe that with these statements and the way he ruled over Clinton and the Democrats, he declared himself unchangeably,” she said.
Pelosi argued when she was asked whether she would try to defeat Kavanaugh of the Office, he should be confirmed and Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so much: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judges,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently judge at the Federal Professional Court in Washington D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the primary abortion decision Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need any hysterical, pre-existing person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘I’m not wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months and years of cooked anger, and she does not get it out without crying.
“We’re crying when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was somewhere manager and said she was also crying when she gets angry, but she has developed a technique. When she gets angry and begins to cry, she says to the person she said: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just talk to her.
I found it great."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is a former job, in a man-dominated office, where I was crying one day because of an insignificant anger and by an older woman, a undercooled manager, who always was afraid of me, was packed on the crack and moved into a staircase.
“Never let her see you cry,” she said.
“You don’t know that you’re stupid.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with yourself because they believe you have gone to the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congress Member of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarried affair and then returned his candidate, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason to not consider the idea of the presidential candidate.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: ‘Snow White and the Seven Swears’.
Since the election campaign had already advanced, she was behind the funding and swore not to candidate if she shouldn't get $2 million together.
It was an unexpected struggle.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1000 to men supported their campaign with only $250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
In the speech she announced not to start an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made the media procurement and direct addressing voters instead of the delegates so difficult, as well as anger over sexism that she was close to tears.
“You could have assumed that I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the pocket towel manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they would be writing on my tombstone.
"You're crying?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the United States and China
The opening salmons of the trade war between the United States and China were stunning. Although the battle has not been over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a grave between the countries in the long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning committee at the beginning of the year when he invested important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum, with penal duties.
The major escalation took place this week with new penal duties on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Peking has backed in the same way every time and recently raised penal duties from five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has sworn to respond to any US action and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon collapse.
Moving Washington to join would mean resigning, but a public necklace against the U.S. would be too tasty for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, my experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision could either create conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is far more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on the Center for New American Security in Asia.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by the seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that circumstances in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government rebuilds the territories destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions have now been given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had their everyday life and the basis of their lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any assistance related to conditions from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the USA team with an end range of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutively on European ground and has no longer won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown after the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with a major part of the tournament, dropped his departure on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and became one of four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team in Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter who possibly played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran from eight Ryder Cups, has become the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t stop.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get back to the cup.
“It’s about the team and I’m glad to have made a contribution,” said the emotional Garcia after European victory.
He goes on to his landlord John Rahm, who won the individual meetings against the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
“I’m so proud of beating Tiger Woods that I’ve been watching since my childhood,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 important titles and will only be overcome by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems to find the fairways all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who made high performances throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I am proud of the boys they have fought.
There was a time tonight when we put Europe under pressure.
We haven't done anything about it.
Hut for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players made a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to take the hat.
We were defeated."
