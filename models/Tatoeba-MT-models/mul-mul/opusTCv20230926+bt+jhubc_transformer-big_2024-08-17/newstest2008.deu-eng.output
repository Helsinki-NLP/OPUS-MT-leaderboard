Food due to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the decline was higher in November than expected - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been out of just 3%, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian notes bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced Leitzsin’s interest rates, but, according to its opinion, interest rates would favor the rising rates of raw materials and a slight decline in unemployment to the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least little on the two percent brand.
According to an analyst, the ECB is located in the bulb: the inflation must be "contracted" in order to exclude subsequent action needs.
With 3.3%, the inflation rate in November reached a 12-year record rise in Germany; in Spain, the rate fell from 3.6% to 4.1%.
The rise in food and energy prices in the euro area is responsible for the rise in inflation.
The MATIF wheat notations increased by 88 percent, and the course for soya beans also reached a record level since 1973.
Also in food oil and dairy products, there was a significant increase in 2007.
The global market price of crude oil rose by 52 per cent this year - last month the price per fax of black gold reached nearly US$100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts will get a 3 percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Local Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathetics has increased significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the consent for the socialists, according to Gallup, has reached a depth of 13 percent.
The difference in the party’s voters falls significantly due to the high determination of opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 per cent) represent a fifth (20 per cent) of the MSZP.
According to a survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary input army: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party exchangers has increased by a percentage in both camps.
Compared to the last point, the overall economic mood has further deteriorated – never before the proportion of those who consider the country’s economic situation as “excluding bad” had been so high (41 per cent), while 46 per cent further consider it “excluding bad”.
With more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population is expected to have a further deterioration in the situation; only one-third of the situation is expected to be improved.
A Gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of the surveyed – a historical high – assessed the prime minister’s work as “very bad as right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány generally, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% misconfidence against the head of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of people who think that you could get the disagreement with the Prime Minister even without government change.
After the disturbances of last October, 35% have been expressed for the remaining of the government and the head of the government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded to participating "safely" and another 20 percent would "probably" give their vote.
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, only 55% would go to the urns "safely" and another 15% would consider their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be predictable.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fees, and 84% would vote against the hospital label.
Replaced to the group of participants in the referendum "with safety" the shares of opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, or 89 per cent.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increases by nearly a fifth
Hypermarkets in Budarus trade area also maintained the average price rise of 16% this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles aus Daily Economy
In the Budarian trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the Napi has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price rises have been recorded in all hypermarkets by over HUF 1,000.
After the prices in the food markets were "davongaloppy" in December last year, the decline is relatively not drastic, compared to the high, previous output level.
However, it is definitely scary for consumers that what they had paid far below HUF 9,000 last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical HUF 10,000 border by at least HUF 91 in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10.573.
(In 6800 the price was HUF 6,800.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained nearly at the level of the previous year, but the prices of pot brushfilets, nuts and mohn have increased strongly.
Prices for honey and bread corresponded to the data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg bread wheat for 139 forints at Auchan.
There was no competitive price drop in the product at less than 200 forints.
Also surprisingly, here was the price of a two liters of Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 Forint, which cost the drink including Pfand only HUF 257.
However, this year, in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Auchan cut the most expensive, and Cora cut the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora’s prices in the Napi basket have increased by 15 to the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between last year's cheapest and most expensive basket was 12%, while the rise between last year's cheapest basket and the most expensive basket was 21%.
The average price rise was 1.480,00 USD.
The average price rise was still at 1.206.00 Forint last year, but the VAT rise was noticeable at last Christmas prices.
This process has been very angry with the trade: apparently, the goods houses were unable to decide exactly what price range they should apply to each item, as the effects of price rising on consumer behavior were unpredictable.
(If the dealer does not plan the speed of circulation of a product, he may fall to significant gains in the price range that is targeted by the traffic intensity.)
In terms of taxation, the deduction of the "Napi" shopping cart last year fell so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference at the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed as the most expensive forint cost by 1,630,00 more than last year, and even at the cheapest forint there was a price rise of 1,284,00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic rise in prices, the price of daily consumption items in the hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: In some basic foods, the Statistical Office found a more than 30 percent increase in the period of 12 months.
Likewise, in addition to meat in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" cart, it seems almost impossible for the last time, as the price level of the expensive product has risen even in the worst case by almost over 10%.
Obviously, butter suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - in any case, they were able to overcome the drastic price rise to the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that most customers in the three goods houses no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable food goes in palettes over the store tables.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless snakes in all three goods houses at the cash, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned sales, not only with food but also with sustainable consumer goods.
Many factors are saved on disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to inappropriate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overlap of beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not directly admissible to the prevention of infections, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
Many factors are also saved for disinfectants.
In the János Hospital’s Traumatology Department, a MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was introduced to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was a similar infection here.
The injured of a severe car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later, the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important surgery has not been carried out since then due to the bacteria still in the patient's body.
Until December 10, this year, infections caused by multi-resistant erectiles were reported from hospitals in 1094 to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant stimulants have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark numbers may be higher.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, which caused Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium bears about a third of people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, mantle inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healed.
However, if the agents are used too high or inappropriately, they are derived from the well-responsive antibiotic resistant bacteria that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in elderly or low body weight patients, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infections or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital’s daily life.
You should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is just not where it is not searched.
Antibiotics resistant
“So many patients are isolated, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks when providing, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment,” says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are examined with MRSA when they are introduced to the hospital, infection can not always be avoided.
Too rare samples
Most of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the prevention of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant stimulant, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and age homes, the hospitals should examine the patients delivered and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced so often.
Lastly, because there are no subsidies for this investigation from the state healthcare box.
Therefore, most cases come to daylight only if the patient has already had a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease images in Hungary.
Antibiotics therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resilience can be made to the drug, but this Directive is also not always administered by hospitals.
Among the ambulants, or patients in basic care, microbiological samples are even more rare, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most frequently transmitted by the nursing staff from one patient to the other.
That is why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drop infections or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patients.
The rooms are often even filled, the beds are hardly different from each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological perspective.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, in the less well-meaning hospitals, it is unfortunately suggested that there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that directly favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be much less common there, or, relatively, the further spread of the stimulant can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government Programme against MRSA
To get MRSA infections in control causes health insurance enormous costs, so they are fighting everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their involvement in the government programme, was kept.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data demonstrate, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant disorders (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Deadlenker police officer was not drunk
In the case of a car accident caused by the Police Chief of the XXII District with a deadly result, the official opinion is now present.
Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Attorney, said on Friday, after the official opinion was submitted, the 21st district chief of police who killed a pedestrian in a car crash on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat on the tax.
The former police boss bog with his own car in the XXII district of Kossuth Lajos Street, crossing a 55-year-old man who crossed the street to a non-signed place.
(This, however, is not a mild circumstance - the guide has, even though pedestrians do not cross the road to the zebra strip, disagreement.)
The pedestrian is injured after entering the hospital.
According to police reports, the manager suffers a shock, then resigned his functions and asked for retirement.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Budapest has initiated its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had been working with the investigators from the beginning.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements on Friday in Budapest, in total of EUR 400 million, which are intended to flow into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy economy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a 300 million EUR framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with subsidies from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement over 100 million has already been signed earlier, with the current agreement on the use of the 200 million EUR allocated.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract is also intended to be spent on the budgetary funding of educational projects.
The EIB has authorised a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the enlargement of the loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of over EUR 50 million, mainly flowing into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, subway line 4 also came to the language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original treaty and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects at a total of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interests are EURIBOR-related, the loan is provided by the EIB with an 8-year withdrawal, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all over Europe looks at the previously rare Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, but which is slowly more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most desirable place for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with affordable ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Among the mountains are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa regions among the most popular, on the sea are the Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Solar Coast", and the historical cities of Sozopol and Nessebar the racing, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly demanding.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the landscape is also dedicated to attracting investors earlier or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very cheap area of Russian recorded more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - trade and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and thus attract tourists in addition to the summer and winter season also in the other two seasons.
Therefore, anticipating investors are already buying in large style, e.g. around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life change.
Most buyers are English, but there are also stakeholders from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to reside buy revitalised properties for 50-100,000 euros, or lowered houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication options are greatly written, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group creates business people who invest in a medium to long-term value increase.
Real estate in the capital becomes increasingly expensive, due to the growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been a 21 percent increase in prices annually.
The increase in real estate prices exceeds largely the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister of Environment, Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries consult on Bali’s schedule, which establishes emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol is over.
There is currently a strong debate between industrial and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate concrete numbers, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 25-40 percent compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether industrial countries are willing to support developing countries financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on supporting developing countries.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-headed Council, expected to be read by the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as stated in the Market and Profit.
Hungary's 6 percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action, and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 (measured by 1990 values), whether the '2012 agreement' will be successfully achieved or not. The Union would even be willing to engage in a 30-percent reduction, provided that other major industrial countries in the world are also willing to meet their commitments according to K.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.5 per cent, while the EU and its 15 Member States had already undertaken a min of 8%.
The provision for Hungary is a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a provision that the country will fully fulfill, as read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use is high on Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects laid down in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, which also highlighted its significance the IPCC, the international climate, which has the most important value in the Unobel’s peace price.
This would delay emission reduction, and an increase in Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, resulting in extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
The British Army is playing on YouTube
British army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to increase popularity on the video portal.
Initially, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have loaded videos on operations against the Taliban since March 2006.
The recordings of miniature cameras attached to helmets are controlled at the air force base in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already controlled 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defence headquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Usage in Afghanistan
The air force originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve to inform the population about the actual objectives of foreign interventions.
Such propaganda is almost free in comparison to traditional television advertisements, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos are always carrying some degree of political embassy as they confirm the existence of the military action decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight amateur recordings, which, besides the carefully processed, also create the network of censored recordings - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in some haulful, "official" propaganda films, the most spoken about the losses, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, many videos that are already being used have been uploaded to the platform, but these "gating" have only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise somewhat differently, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the player can climb into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-threatening simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatche in the ministries
Monika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, is in no way unusual: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference that allows her employees to spend the year 2007 with coffee and pogatche.
Some ministers celebrate with live music, others magical Christmas mood with tombola or stuck into the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the officials.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held at the defence reserve, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Festival of the Waisens" children will be given to falling soldiers, at the "Mission Festival" family members will be convicted of the currently stationed overseas soldiers, but there is also a reception for the press.
The ressort provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resources, the National Development Agency (National Development Agency) and the Ministry of Economy and Traffic are proposed.
The 4.32 million Forint costly Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics will be held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
Although the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a Tombola birthday.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million expensive Forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festival.
The room rental was 1 million Forint, the rest was spent for more than 400 loaded guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU territories.
For the celebration, the building of the Lust Theatre ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information since we have not reached the officials.
Why the dress?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a minister’s speech, and after dinner there was live music to dance.
At [origo] request, it was reported that the ball had no obligation to wear balls or dresses.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Self-Administration are preparing each for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the feast for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 forints.
Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas celebration, but to the annual conference.
It is estimated that about 180 guests, which, according to the press department, are only beaten with coffee and pogatche, are celebrated with 350,000 forints.
Minister of Self-Administration, Gordon Bajnai, is just going to meet his colleagues in the ministry's hall.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festive hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured with 2,500 forint per head – around this money there is a buffet receipt with subsequent incentive.
Since the beginning of János Veres’ office, employees of the PM celebrate this every year.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the minister’s official speech but also because of the celebration for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites on January 20 a New Year recipe, this time the Ministry’s Christmas celebration will be held.
The hundred guests are asked to enter the castle of Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the report of the ressort, the expenditure is measured with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, there will be a very simple stand-off that only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receipts that are held every year begin traditionally with a brief speech of the Minister and sounds restrained by mouse.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, there was no information available at the press department of the Environment Ministry.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to celebrate the art industry museum.
More and more forces mobilised for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Union Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the strike of uncertain duration starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest meeting will be held, and on Monday, on the day of the folk referendum on the health insurance law, the labour resignation begins.
It is calculated with strike-related significant transport disabilities, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and also the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) strike up to 13 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be jointly announced by the League of Trade Unions and the Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
There will also be a LIGA - MOSZ Streak Committee which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all organizations who have joined the strike will set up work for an indefinite time, unless there is no agreement with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately revoke the call to strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees will meet together to consult on the further procedure.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it is only in the late evenings, or even at midnight to vote on the health insurance law.
The strikes that begin on Monday will have to be expected to have significant transport disabilities: the railroads will stop their work for an indefinite time, in the morning the majority of public transportation is silent and more than half of Volán societies.
At the same time, there will be manyrorts highway shutdowns in one direction.
The call to the strike is followed by numerous trade unions and civilian organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga Website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, others plan a temporary job relocation.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement has been reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are traveling by the train just about the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will start operations until 13:00, the Budapest Airport will run early between 7 and 9:00, the LIGA Trade Unions for Electricity and Heat Energy will work for four hours, and the Teachers' Trade Union will call the Democratic Teachers' Trade Union for 2 or 2-8 hours strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors strives across the country at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Employees in Health and Social Affairs, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, holds a two-hour warning string.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discussion.
The second requirement concerns the step-by-step introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be fulfilled from next year.
Requirement number three is that the eligible professional groups will allow access to the early pension system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer relating to the subdirections submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now requires a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysing Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard established in August with the support of the "Movement for a better Hungarian" have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The "Risk Warning Report" of the Institute states, among other things, that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "exacerbation of the existing ethnic tensions between the Cigarians and non-cigarians in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic disputes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely to provoke such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is considered a negligence by political officials: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups that have now built their political strategy on the contrary to the Roma Hungarian approach."
It is suspected that this would aggravate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremities, as well as increase the likelihood of violent disputes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have been not only due to the enormous attention of domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad significantly damaged, particularly with respect to confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
Since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been constantly rising, so since the summer of 2007, several national self-defense associations have been established.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civilian organization each while they are openly proud of preparing their members for the defence tasks - sometimes armed - (catastrophe defence, country defence, order defence), with reference to the incomparableness of police, army, state, and self-relation."
And further: all this happens in accordance with that method that tries to take different political and partisan ambitions based on the political and partisan fraud of the population as a civil initiative.
Therefore, the emphasis of the civil character and the form of the association serves not only to overthrow legal barriers that could appear during the entry into court - it is a political strategy at the same time.
As can be seen by the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a risk-higher factor also for relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policy in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose founding was announced in August 2007 by the right-wing Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass excuses held in a city district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents just as the cause of the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the objective of the organisation of the "national protection" is.
Its opinion was that in the past 17 years a regular “cigarette terror” was noticeable in Bulgaria, but the state remained unfair and indifferent, according to Political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have taken place a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As stated, the increased risk of ethnic disputes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also responds to the threats organizing their own protection, according to Political Capital’s risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Every year, risk analysis reports would be published, and risk change trends should be recognized, the public will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redisposing the working days has now been established around the holidays, but the coming year will give us fewer such days.
In the European Union and in the United States, you can also understand something else under “featuring day”.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national holidays and labour-free days.
Work-free days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the last days are alone that the Silvester holidays can rest.
All year round, we have a total of 14 holidays.
The national holidays are on 15 March, which reminds the Revolution of 1848, and on 23 October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the establishment of the state, the work is celebrated on May 1, November 1 and 2 we remember our deceased.
In addition, there are two holidays for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall to a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proved to be in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holidays, is finally to be completed, is laid down by the Minister of Labour for many years by his own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employers, to public employees and officials of the public service in the same manner.
Except only companies and facilities where the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. at the holidays.
Heuer, the work order will only be brought together by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester are taking the time balance, or the holiday that is cancelled for it.
More holidays fall in the middle of the week next year, or at the end of the week, so there will be less redispositions in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for just four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, may be a rest day.
The second redisposition is associated with the holiday on October 23: On Saturday, October 18, you will need to work on Friday, October 24 in advance.
However, the end of the year will be countless in the sign of the holidays, after December 24, everything is laid and remains, even if Silvester falls on Wednesday.
Six scary little things to irritate colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" into everyday workplace.
The question is simply whether you get used to these small inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstood, in other angry situations consciously.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department has called," a colleague said.
That you have forgotten a meeting?
Otherwise, you regret it and try to rebuild it by calling at the marketing department and quietly acting, you would have forgotten to address the message (this is the less common method).
Most often, the thing is off with an apology.
Before you get into a shameful discussion, you should consider what makes it possible to prepare your colleagues for really unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Loan something that doesn’t belong to one’s own?
There is hardly much more nervous than when you grab a document, office accessory, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the heating device was still on the desk - is it gone today early?
Or will the lost ball writer be discovered on the table of a colleague?
Without a question, you should borrow nothing from your colleagues, because they will be quite angry when they find something has gone away.
So, no curves or post-it from the office into the pocket, because it could meet one by itself: no more there if you need it urgently.
Strategy about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trap that has already been put into the world.
Who's done with who?
Where and why?
You should not bind the information (or assumptions) about the private life of your colleagues if possible to everyone to the nose!
And if anyone opens up and betrays us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to silence like a tomb instead of directing those present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick without a reason?
If you are calling in the office to report on painful headaches, because you just feel unwanted, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one: your own work, unreplaceable accomplishments, projects with fixed dates now have to do instead of one.
Don’t play badly with your colleagues!
If you know that you won’t get to the office the next day, or that something could come between why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be confronted with the unexpected absence.
Swimming, Swimming, Telephone
You're just deepened in his work, but is it suddenly disturbed by the loud kicking of the colleagues?
Would you like to hear a phone call that you shouldn’t hear?
You should not be nervous with colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which is carried out over their heads), trample, persistent shaking or nuts.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the other people always guilty?
If a project is not completed in a timely manner, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the guilt of your own forgottenness to others!
If possible, you should not talk to the chaos in the office or to the loud colleagues!
It’s best to make your mistakes, and apologize if others have also affected it!
The question of how to rebuild the error, or recover the lost, is just too correct!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training shoes and slippers: comfortable for home, but nothing has lost in the office!
Not even then you should wear so much clothes if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't be too slim - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress in the office accordingly - if you wish, even beautiful and elegant!
Everyone wants to be right - or how to become uninterested for others
Stop and go-traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a geese, coupled with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female chore.
It's Zagar's song "Wings of Love" that sounds on mr2.
The home music scene hasn’t been confusing us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the stain differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall image, and even if the garage rock with its guitar chest again is "in", the domestic electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, musicing himself in the band Yonderboi before he—maybe because a host house does not tolerate two peppers—because he began his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melted elements of jazz, electronics, and pop, was only successful when you asked to compose the soundtrack to a movie (e.g.
"Season" by Ferenc Turk).
The formation, which was initially featured in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" broke its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and shortened Zagar, along with Yonderboi, to nearly the only trends that are marketable even in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand too.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album released now with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression emerges from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying play would also be okay, but it falls in addition to the ethical character of music which – according to the spirit of time and trends – are more guitars, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the Millenáris premiere.
A song from the album has even succeeded as a radio striker - who has been putting the ear root successively to the ears of Mr2 Petőfi broadcasting from early to late pop music, with the number "Wings of Love", recorded by six domestic singers (“Underground Divas”).
It's all right, so?)
Hvg.hu has asked for a request at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How much is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be lightweight and nothing, but it can also be produced only for sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also result from a fair motive.
The readiness of the listener works according to this principle, independent of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: Overseas, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that passes around them much more careful because they also consider them part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
It’s important who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
Music is not for a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable in concerts, where there is already mutual interaction, but these are in turn only in the incomprehensible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one: If you want to do it right to everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career rather in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, except that you try to interpret this in our music again and again.
We see ourselves rather than team players who rely on the musical presence of the other person and allow them to develop.
Initially, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi were inevitable, as many of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi stands "Wings of Love" first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then hold as a rabbit for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as a final of the album with which we wanted to solve the soundorgy and the slightly harder topics.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly, what was the leadership principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a Gospel-like chore.
Then the idea came to compile the chore from talented soloists of the native music scene.
This is how the six-headed chore emerged - i.e. Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptised "Underground Divas".
Hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song the same, or did the girls make it together?
B. Zs.: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needed "something".
The agreement's sequence formally demanded a singing voice.
I had the melody in the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It almost all came to anxiety and terrifying spontaneously.
I can remember, I was pretty electric at that time, but it already needed the "Divas".
With my own voice, the song would never become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing perfectly together and are not loud than the music, so their song will not only be accompanied by the music.
They were also on the stage behind.
Is that an intention?
B.Z.: That they were behind it was because of purely technical problems.
However, we didn’t want to give them consciously solo roles.
In the number, it is also about forgotten a little about his ego, forgot where he came from and where he was going, let us simply allow us to take the specific wings that bring the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric condition that we have felt when the song came up.
Hvg.hu: What was the most excited song?
B. Zs.: In fact, nothing in the musical creation work, it has been more difficult to mix tasks.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma" in which I play on a concert clavier, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls" where the Groove didn't want to work anymore, but it's all together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes continuously with the concerts and also now that I have the album "unleased".
Currently there are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
A fraudulent broker risked billions of low-value feelings
Floorless fraud
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Société Générale, the owner of the so-called Commerční banka.
For this reason, she came for nearly five billion euros.
But it seems more likely that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it equally to his colleagues, but he certainly wasn’t able to do it.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's rather mentally weak," he was listening from the mouth of his managers who told him at the police.
But as the statements of Kerviels, published by the French media, for example, the newspaper Le Monde, showed that he was a man who had earned 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his trades.
Crisis not only in America
“Everything I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said.
In the summer he managed to earn half a billion euros just in the US crisis.
He had already had the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had debit problems, would be in difficulty.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had gained up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Because I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel says and continues saying he has definitely kept nothing for himself.
During all the hearing he admits that he has false documents, so that no one may come to him.
He even managed to lead his boss behind the light, even though the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
He was afraid to fly?
That's hardly.
“I thought she was satisfied with the fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary amounted to about $5,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant of a broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“When I first spoke in 2005, I knew that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development,” Kerviel explained to the investigative officer.
But shortly after his entry, the first great success came.
With the alliance’s shares, he earned much by putting half a billion euros on the rate losses of this title at the London bombing attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make profit, let's leave you
“It’s like a snowball,” he said to the police officers.
But the chiefs allegedly knew everything, or they knew it.
“So long as I earned money, you closed your eyes.”
But then, at the beginning of this year, a big strike came.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
In mid-January, he wanted to compensate for it.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros for it.
And how did they come to him in the shadow?
He was suspected of having a vacation.
“I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to look at him in the cards,” Kerviel said.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programmes that will allow the Czech Republic to reach €14 billion (about 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to allocate about 100 billion kroons from the "Entreprise and Innovation" program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will be flown into transport construction.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprises and Innovation" programme is aimed at serving entrepreneurs and companies to earn funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
This aims to gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, and also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The previous EU funds-based cash acquisition of the Czech Republic is one of the most successful new Member States.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year prison sentences for expressed presidents
An appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the 20-year imprisonment for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced to $100 million for financial fraud (nearly $1.8 billion) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest at his company at the Nicaragua metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back behind Gitter is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prisoners whether to allow German to put his punishment at home or whether he must go into prison.
A court found four years ago that German had regularly moved government money on accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund founded by the Germans to finance his 2001 election campaign.
The budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special in this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government, which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was yet to be approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because he had submitted him by Minister Sobotka (of this party), and therefore the ČSSD could not allow him to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the request of discredit against the government, this time nothing has happened dramatically.
The House of Deputies accepted this traditionally little attention, yet a very significant law in all tranquillity.
This is somewhat paradox.
All governments start and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the power struggle of government and opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay him more attention.
A controversy among politicians is much more interesting to the public than tough numbers.
The state budgets in the past socialist governments suffered from three weaknesses that could not eliminate the budget for 2008 at once:
The first is the high percentage of expenditure that is binding by law, not only of pensions, but also of social expenditure that the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction consists of the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government deficit.
This budget is public and somehow under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors provided additional sources of investment except taxes, taxes and bank loans, often unprecedented debts that debted their council houses excessively.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts by massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks they had received in the train of privatization by the State.
This source has already been defeated.
If we only follow official and verified facts, we note that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been through a phase of growth that is honoured by the ČSSD without interruption.
This was a unique way for their governments to arrange public finances.
Instead, these governments debted the state even more.
Other countries, besides a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame that is mainly attributed to previous governments.
We are among the countries that are at least threatened by poverty, seen at the global level.
Therefore, no massive social programs are needed, which, unfortunately, have been overwhelmed in a huge scale just over the past few years.
Even if it is possible to delete a part of the unsuccessful populistic expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no shift in the retirement hall in the future and a retirement reform, then almost any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will be harmful to him.
It is only slightly overwhelming when you say that there will be officials from ruling politicians who will mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but only the deprivation of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure can be fulfilled.
The deficit of $70 billion planned for 2008 would be quite excessive if previous governments hadn’t spent in the past 10 years, which was just going on.
If we don't really want to become pure administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we need to be patient, and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees as it is able to make peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis on the financial markets together.
As a result, more than $100 billion will be made by auctions to the currencies markets.
On these auctions, the banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money to each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it lucky for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time after the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of each state agree on such a coordinated action to defence or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step aims to eliminate the biggest difficulties in the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can afford," Bernard Baumohl wrote in a report to his customers from the Economic Outlook Advisory Company.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added.
The banks have already lost $60 billion due to unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billion losses.
“Central banks have really been afraid of what else can happen when they decide to do this,” ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies said.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to debt, loans will be even more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and fall into a recession of the American economy, possibly impacting economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used for renting between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other money, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio, from Tempus Consulting, told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is allegedly most harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed himself on the issue of global warming.
The criticism was now focused on the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet", he suggested that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is merely a replacement for a real solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized the idea of his book that the subject of it is very important for him and that he is so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet on caricatures of my opinion."
Interested people could now read their attitudes unmistakably.
Klaus recalls that he is not a climateologist, but he believes he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is scholar, capable of understanding and evaluating professional discussions, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the theories that climate change is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, so that there is no consensus among scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious, and therefore no threat, and that the efforts to overcome climate change and to overcome unintensively influence climate change.
In addition, he considers it to force someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to unacceptable, unproofed views, to see it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly said he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had talked about the same theme in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver's license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will travel on the roads after the New Year without valid driving permits.
According to the authorities, mostly those who don’t want to drive have rejected their driver’s license.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of licenses, the officials of the capital will be overwhelmed with applications, and the interest in the exchange has grown this week.
The city administration produces approximately 2,000 customers a day.
You have to wait for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet rejected their driver’s license.
The exhibition takes a new driver's license for 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a short term of five days.
In this case, the driver has to pay 500 krones.
Drivers who do not make the required exchange until the end of the year and run without a valid driver’s license threatens a fine from January.
The debtor will pay a maximum of 2,000 krones.
However, the police can use it with a request in the event of the infringement.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty can increase to 2500 krones.
According to previous information, one can also be punished by the municipality who does not drive at all.
He could threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the officers to leave mild wallet and impose a punishment of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened a thousand crown punishment.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a personal certificate that everyone has to have a valid.
People who no longer want to drive should give their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipality or to send him there by letter.
At the end of the year driving licences were invalid, which were issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, the drivers have to gradually exchange other types of driver licenses.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other driver licenses.
The court reduces penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of having done a joint case with David Berdych’s band, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
This was decided by the Supreme Court of Prague in a legal ruling which reduced its punishment by or by two years.
Initially, the Detectives of the "Office for the Fighting of Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no possibility of appeal against today’s judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself is accused in this matter, he first faces the first sentence.
In other cases, however, he had already received fines of a total of 16 years.
Too much more he cannot be condemned.
In January, a district court accused 19 people of participating in robberies, the Supreme Court negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most accused from the beginning disputed the accusation with the justification, it is a designated case.
According to the Bohemia District Court, police members, inter alia, in consultation with Berdych, provided information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the band to get rid of criminal prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30% of the money.
The prosecution concerns the crimes of bands between 1999 and 2001.
Especially for theft crimes, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for office measurement and unauthorized arms possession.
In case of domestic investigations, police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target pipe and a machine gun.
The band, according to the accusation, has enriched many millions of crowns by its robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this case, courts Berdych and a number of others recognized legally guilty for further robberies.
Other men from Berdych’s circle have to take responsibility in another trial, and other cases have not yet come to court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who have been in Irish prison and are waiting for the final decision on their deliverance for the purpose of prosecution in the Czech Republic.

For the transfer of children to a dismissal clinic, the lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants compensation from the hospital in Třebíč 12 million krone plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million, and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
Ondřej Dostál, the legal representative of the hospital, therefore, does not fully agree with the proposal Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal that it is too high," Dostál said after the negotiation today.
"But in order to make an opinion on this counter proposal, we need the opinion that made the counterpart.
We'll see if it's worth it at all.
But we stand in the belief that this should be in the area of hundreds of thousands of people together,” Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
Veleba served as a basis for compensation negotiations, an opinion that had been prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths, according to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry.
Men are more stressful, even if they saw accusations against them, they could have prevented the confusion of newborns.
The women, in turn, face the consequences of the experienced trauma worse, as well as what is now going on, Veleba caught the content together.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged in Třebíč on 9 December last year’s nurses.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Przybyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jabloňov.
The district head of the Vysočina (Böhmish-Mährich height) granted at the end of October each family 100000 crowns as a substitute for expenditure for which they suffered due to the errors of the hospital in Třebíč, which was in the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law.
In the case of doubt, they have to access a reserve fund, only in exceptional ways they can apply for assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far reported relatively low amounts of damage, the amounts determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand "Kingry Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he first used the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the parasitic popularity of Bolek Polívkas," Polívkas lawyer said after the negotiation.
All of them presented themselves with the words "Walachian Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is Harabish.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money procurement and the concepts of activities,” he said.
According to him, the cause of controversy about money.
“After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they might have some of it as well.
They want to win parasites in our work,” he said.
Lukrative Business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993 he was awarded the actress Radoslav Brzobohatý.
However, it did not coincide with the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the minds of spending Walach passports.
From an initial fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity came out, to which Harabiš then joined the establishment of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and his signature in the passports and offered even discounts to its owners when visiting his farm and his theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also today suggested that Harabiš used only the simple idea that Polívka had made public in the broadcast "many" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
“Polívkas’ popularity has certainly helped the project of the Walach Kingdom,” the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team were intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today's disrupted parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš for Polívka in Vsetín organized the official crowning.
But since then, between Polívka and Harabish began to argue the disputes that occurred in the substitution of "King Boleslav I elected to the Day of Sankt Nimmerleins".
He then took the lead role in encouraging Harabish Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen's mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed the complaint against Harabish and his company, which the court filed today.
Clearness in the fight could bring the competition prepared by Harabish for the throne and a half princess.
This should lead to a new king.
Details and a date he didn’t want to betray.
“We don’t want to share anything.
It should be like the king's withdrawal in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also sign up quietly,” Harabish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Previews break
To say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not much worth, the quality of the circuit, direction and processing could be described as rather under average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The kombi with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low headfree on the back seats.
These complaints are now no longer, because the caroserie of the Kombi is designed so that even two meters of men will not suffer.
Quickly continue
The interior equipment I just pass short to not repeat too much.
This is a pretty successful design where I have only objections because of the careful medium tunnel.
I would welcome some more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times in which we can complain about too short seats or head supports.
The side content has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
With regard to the room offer, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the carrosserie here.
In Kombi, the deficiency of headfreedom is also eliminated.
Bags in the luggage
The main thing in this car is the charging room.
I have to call it (also due to the climbing back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The holes are equipped with stand-apartments that represent an ideal compromise.
They don’t bother, they can pull out and keep even heavy objects fixed.
But let's talk about the charge volume.
According to a table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is rather average compared to competition.
However, it is not compared to the vehicle most sold in the Czech Republic of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains noticeable by 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a foreign vacation or when inviting a child car.
But to emphasize the positives, I still have to mention the entire flat charging space or the very low charging canvas after turning the back seat.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder fuel engine with a hubraum of 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, it should look like a 1600 cubic motor that drives a family-back.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and gets away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes seems like his envelope is squeezed with a lap, then I can just be excited about him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400-driven gasoline engine of 329900 Krones is still up.
With our engine, it costs from 410900 knots, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car is again in addition to booking with $800,000.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc washer solution, electric window lifts rear and...
This is how the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once you expect the supplementary equipment of a fabia and you will arrive at a totally similar sum.
So there is only the decision which brand you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools failed
In British schools, the number of children from countries in Eastern Europe is increasing, causing the local fears of further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far been facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools is significantly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the disputes between local and Slovakian immigrants are gradually increasing.
Conflicts, squads and raids among students have been transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with a iron band.
The accused defended himself that the boy had insulted them with racist immorality.
Police also had to intervene after the attack of two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist comments against the man and threw him with stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed onto a pocket and screwed onto us.
When I told him to stop, he kept us with apples and beans and then broke out his seed," a mother of Slovakian student in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
The complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals described the fight with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a fight for survival.
The cases indicated show that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is increasingly stressed.
In the UK, 700,000 Slovaks have been reported to have been searching for work here.
About 30,000 Slovak students visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be fulfilled if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a tea.
Palms and All Inclusive with knives offering on the beach pizza, ice and disturbing cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands you can find it in a large scale.
Only on an island you can find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antills.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had invaded in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Creating it led to one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything in the United States was considered a crime (especially during the prohibition) was viewed and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were amongst others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew over the broad boulevards, cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifty years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his jacket.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the floor guita in Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult exchanges of the fifty years are running around in Havana until today, because the once imported schigulis and Fiats in the salt and wet air have long fallen apart.
Can Havanna, particularly its oldest part, be strongly down, nowhere around can you find as many wonderful colonial attractions as right here.
Other places are just cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
With regard to the urgent need for tourism, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have not only been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marrow that is unique in the world and especially attracts railroad lovers.
The sugar pipe from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-driven steam trails to the sugar factories.
Their car park has not been renovated for decades, and so you can see kissing and fully functioning locomotives, whose elders are still in the museum somewhere else.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not leave the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You no longer need to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
Keep in mind that in the already mentioned property Hemingways there is a museum, whose visit should not be allowed to escape the author.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The vegetation grows on calves.
The mogotas, calves and rocks, rising steeply from the valley floor, in their holes, gathered fertile soil, through which also depleted rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of Havana cigarette factories.
Some may also seem interesting that there was the Chilean consequence of the television series "Major Zeman".
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth encompassed itself in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French residents, has not changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road that would have linked the area with the rest of the country in the 1950s.
This insulation contributed to remaining unmatched.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was broken down, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sugar Factory Valley.
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This city in the east of Cuba is described as the most beautiful of the island.
Of course, this view will also be influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead to Guantánamo have to overcome high and crushed mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human interventions.
These eastern preposts of Cuba were incorporated by UNESCO in its world heritage directory thanks to its un touched nature.
The best chocolate is made there, in which the church shows the Columbus Cross (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, is seen several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the room, the cigarettes, the Sierra-Maestra Mountains, the pork book and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabarett, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron of Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, a African religion, to which the descendants of slaves confess, all this could be written on many pages.
But how to say so: look better with your own eyes.
Allieds in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment have influenced the United States on the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country in Scotland had agreed on this in Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating countries are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States by its Defence Minister Robert Gates calls for NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the residents to start a further development of the economy and security,” the British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels has reached the highest level for five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to last year, even sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have been struck at an absolute border with respect to the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they require additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the specific goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop said today.
“I’m not happy with what we have in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” said De Hoop of the Reuters agency to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, in recent months, there is also a dispute about whether all allies in Afghanistan will do their best.
For example, due to passivity, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" described the German soldiers this week as faulty.
"Afghanic non-seat runs away: The Germans do games while our boys fight," the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image newspaper turned into a counterattack and printed an image of a British unit at a rugby race in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will be high-speed in 2009 to a billion
In each Czech Republic, a government debt of 84,000 crowns is paid.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion kroons by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe 159.2 billion wives this year.
However, in early December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of state budget policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic increased to 842.7 billion kroons by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on public debts from early October.
In each Czech Republic, a debt of 84,000 crowns falls.
Over the past year, the government owed more than 111 billion dollars.
“To date, it seems that thanks to the lowest deficit for next year, we may exceed the limit of a billion kroons only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion kroons,” said David Marek, Patria Finance analyst, to the iHNed.cz server.
Likewise, Vladimír Pikora, Analyst of Next Finance, says: “To overcome a billion, we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation is changing on the political stage, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could last until 2010.
But I don’t think of such a change,” he noted.
Debt Growth
State debt comes from the debt of the government and comes mainly from the collection of deficits of the government budget.
State debt is financed by shadow bonds, government debt bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
The domestic government debt has risen to 719.4 billion kroons this year.
State foreign debts have now increased by 1.7 billion kroons to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion krone at the end of September and dropped by 13.7 billion since June.
The average fall of government debt has increased to 6.5 years.
“The total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy goes.
It is interesting that growth should be recorded especially in debt recipes where the growth is 20%.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that you can do something before the retirement reform comes,” Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing strategy and the management of government debts indicates that the government had planned to take 159.2 billion kroons this year.
However, in early December, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion dollars thanks to the better development of state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government’s deficit, which is apparently going to reach $76 billion this year instead of the 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is a maximum planned fund for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion Krones, a ten billion reserve for pension payments, funding for 43 billion government debt bonds and rates for bonds at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion Krones.
For her name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who was accused of defending Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days detention and subsequent expulsion on Thursday night by a court in Khartum.
The British was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name of Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be defeated.
After parents complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school lady who was working at the Unity High School of Khartum was arrested at home on Sunday and charged with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of Defense of Islam.
In fact, this issue takes its beginning in September, when the teacher calls on her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classroom.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school manager Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed’s favorite names.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially a very common surname in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear himself did not wear a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be a defeat of Islam.
A Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and that she would never have done anything to get closer to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is just a mistake and it is just a mistake.
An opinion that shares many students of the teachers who describe them as very careful to their students and as a person who never speaks of religion in the classroom.
It should be noted that the name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the UK for which 14 different forms of writing exist in English.
This name often selected by Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the prophets (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how do the rules relating to the use of this name sound?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
At the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have terminated a sixth and last session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their disputes about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on peace in the region being in play, Frank Wilsner Belgrad and Pristina, whose American counterpart, urged to comply with their commitments to peacekeeping, and to continue negotiations beyond the end of the negotiations.
There will be no violence in the immediate future, but we are standing at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and said there are quite clear tensions.
End of the mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which the European Union, the U.S. and Russia join themselves, will meet last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of 90% of Albanian spoken provinces could be clearer if Ichinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council until 10 December.
Baden’s talks, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika had received the U.N. order for a new mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation order to end on 10 December.
The Russians who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo’s independence at the Security Council remained beyond the continuation of negotiations on this expiry date.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, a agreed solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the United Nations for eight years, western countries have been supervised by the EU for the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide on its benefit.
Belgrade consists of stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, Kosovo’s President Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been conducted since Monday the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared its regrets.
However, he added that the plan for autonomy proposed by Belgrade belongs to a past that has led to murder and deportation.
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, on the other hand, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be striving and warned the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it has a particularly "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision would be taken alone and alone in the Security Council, where Russian allies have a veto right.
The parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the rows of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
You have to end as you started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied that Kosovo's parliament would have the last word on the status, and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian peoples will be terminated in conjunction with the Western countries.
Bush uncovers an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He further explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the wake of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop their colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the peace plan to which they agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This name covers the three serious problems that turn the disputes between Israeli and Palestinians mainly: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the present state of Israel in 1948.
According to the U.S. President, Abbas took the word and insisted that the upcoming negotiations would be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly, providing a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
As Olmert said, he committed to direct and without interruption the upcoming arms stop negotiations and to make an effort to end them until the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exists next to one another, to the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received a guarantee in this sense of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries to the way that Israel offers peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 War, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a breakthrough in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, said the Saudi-Arabic prince in his interview with the Saudi-speaking daily newspaper financed by funds.
According to the lawyer, police officers are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumours are facing.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of investigations by the National Discipline Authority of Police (IGPN), a police car was conducted on Sunday, shortly after 17 p.m., on the Louise-Michel Rue towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on track, and ran 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, so not released for public road transport (see below), came driven by two youths without a helmet, with very high speed.
It touched the left side of the police car, after it had missed its precursor from the right, a policeman said.
The control of alcohol carried out in vehicle passports is much negative.
The condition of the car (convulsed cat wings, distorted wind protection disc, distorted blowing stain) proves the rigidity of the blow.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the state attorney of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGP with an investigation into the facts of "unvoluntary killing and lack of assistance to persons in danger" in consensus with the headquarters for public security of ValO.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that it excluded the responsibility of police officers to investigate the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small power wheel has arrived relatively quickly on its left side.
Yesterday, a kind of rail, certainly caused by rubbing the foot rails on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained trapped together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles were captured and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The names of the two victims were obduced yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, thus the police would have left the place very quickly, without providing help to the two youths.
Although the IGPN remains quite cautious, it would also exclude this matter with regard to any serious mistakes.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations, which is necessary for further investigations, and in which you have to do very carefully.
Libération has encountered an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct views of the scene.
We went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her again, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally disturbed policeman who hid.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phone call.
In the light of the tension that was rapidly formed around the event and, as it appears, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the youth, the police officers who had arrived at the place of the accident were taken into the car.
According to this statement, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
You have also applied heart massages, but misleading.
I will not allow you to claim that the police had not provided assistance to youth.
You have first helped these young people.
The firefighter has arrived immediately.
It was done everything to try to save her, the attorney emphasized.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had been called out of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas granates employed there by the ordinary forces.
They then threw stones with which they injured the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Some were temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionists, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had been found in Multan (Middle) and Peshawar (Northwest).
The lawyer movement received on Monday the support of the united religious parties in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the emergency and the waste that made a oath to Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election session on October 6th in the following days.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was denied and dismissed by his office.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate said in the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give up the supreme command on the army and become a civilian president has no longer been applicable since the emergency call, Vice-Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
It was expected that he would resign his military uniform until November 15, the date on which his first term of office was ended as president.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be moved in January.
In addition, the Pakistani government demented rumors that held harsh in the country, according to which President Musharraf would have assigned a place of residence from his deputy military leader.
More than one-third of pregnancy is still not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as badly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, 40 years after adoption of the newborn legislation that permitted pregnancy in France, one in three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as badly planned or unexpected births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a 5-6% distillation rate.
According to the Institute, the percentage of pill consumers between 20 and 40 years of age that used the pill has increased from 5% to 60% in 1970 today, however, liberalization of pregnancy prevention has enabled a better control of fertility.
Nowadays, eight in ten births are carefully planned.
At one in five couples even calculated accurately per month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems the most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repairs at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will take more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defect solar collector that is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A guarded exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools equipped by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts downloaded the Harmony module from the space ferry Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that will soon include European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a type of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 1.7.5 tonnes heavy module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the occupation became the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module whose voltage width is 76 meters.
And it occurred that one of the collectors that can emerge like Akodeone was damaged by a clamped cable at a length of about a meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector anymore.
The astronauts who originally left the space ferry Discovery for a control course and then repaired another solar collector whose rotation system was incorrect, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-meter long remote arm of the space ferry on which the station was installed to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very shipped, it has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
Thus, the 46-year-old learned physician was chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After he had precisely recovered the damage, he scattered the defect cable and fastened a kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed close to the cliff, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool that he used had a mini hockey striker rounded with insulator to prevent the solar collectors that generate several hundred volts of electric hits, the astronauts had planned and assembled on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely broken down before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the spacecraft Discovery today to be expected to fly back to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS is sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros in order to act against the remains of the A400M, the EADS stock currently shows a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again, referring to the remains caused by the slowly advanced development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft’s young flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for delays in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounted to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the European manufacturer's mother group EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance objectives (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its four-year results on Thursday.
The group also suggests that the estimation of the new costs is related to the remaining six months.
To recall that EADS’ business performance decreased by 86% in 2006, significantly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the A380 of the very large carrier aircraft.
The group had initially provided a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, the United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her striving for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses a public broadcast message to voters who have already been recorded but whose contents are kept secret.
He does this as a top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party, for which he announces a more massive victory.
Yesterday, the president did not let him see when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied with delivering a new point of attack against the Western powers, which are accused of intervention – his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and expect honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have been there.
It is a challenge for an oppressive election race.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the oppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days of imprisonment for unlawful demonstrations, according to his lawyer continued to ban visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two more further questions are raised:
Who will become President of Putin’s succession?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to be announced until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-electioned in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot take part in a third mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the All-Powerful Party of the United Russia, the government and president will be elected?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
That's a tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: in this country, the bourgeoisie society, which was Christianized for five centuries to Europe, only slowly evolved; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin re-included the model of a patriarchal state, which was fully accepted by the population, as this new patriarchalism followed no terrorism, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman from the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free pieces resign the personal responsibility they have put on the day shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
What do you think about for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative authorities understand to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local lists of the United States of Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general community prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
The conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What's more over?
Those who are in power aren’t so bad, why are they discharged?
A heavy reminder
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, located at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now unless with a humanitarian intention, that is, individually and namely related, that is, on a query of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the U.S., have agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research, especially about deportations of prisoners, concentration camp detentions and the health condition of forced workers, explains Reto Masters, head of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, had been opposed to make these name-related documents accessible to the public due to the heaviness of some information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The detention lists of concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo were collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or forced to work, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their detention in order to allow them the way for their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 employees are working tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to the bathroom Arolsen.
It is not possible to expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, Mr Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Centre for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, said in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
The mutual trade between India and Europe now reaches EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s main trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers had given the European Commission green light to open negotiations in order to sign Free Trade Agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian nations (Asia), which has already reached the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the ninth trade partner in the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economic areas and India would improve access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe constitutes the first or second market for the ten most commonly exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants exchanged goods of €47 billion annually and services of €10 billion this week, had Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's President, President of the European Commission in New Delhi, will be freely announced by the President of the European Commission's President, Manuel of the European Commission.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England was worried on Thursday that the current recurring concern about the loan conditions would overcome, announcing a £10 billion offer with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, a offer with an unusual period of time.
In order to weaken the concerns that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give banks greater confidence in the way they are to organize their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to allocate a significant part of their savings during the conservation phase, which begins to offer a five-week open-mark for them on December 6.
The Bank continues to declare that in this way, at 12:15 GMT £10 billion (14 billion euros) will be marketed, at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time the BoE brings liquidity in circulation in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE added in its communication that it is ready to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of the interbank lease with its basic interest rate.
The different interbank interest rate of day to day was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been paid to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put in circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penal fees that the banks had prevented from using them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound rate as opposed to the euro, many proposed to sign the sums put in circulation by the European Central Bank for more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals for purchase power
On Thursday, UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on buying power, which is the same as a rejecting the text.
The text produced in the context of a socialist niche (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group) adopted about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, most of which 50% for employment supplementation, reintroduction of the floating TIPP, for transport checks or for hire limitation.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the items (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion that led to partially too severe word exchanges between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on the purchase power.
The leader of the MPs of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would submit the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finance, which was reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumours about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn’s Festival.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, not more or less, as an example of the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones told C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campsite holidays.
The festival will probably take place on a 500 acre large private farm approximately 40 minutes away from Philadelphia from August 8.-10.
The leader of the Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most famous festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, attracting about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, license licenses and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been with, says that his company and Melvin Benn work parallel to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations in the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in polit debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival at an exceptional place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago after it has been in 2002 with Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million each in 2007 and $11.8 million on gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in a urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival where ours are held on the urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
“The purpose of one way or another is to merge these two concepts together in order to at the same time give the impression of a rural festival to the European and urban areas in the American way.”
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
Later, it refuses to reject the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and to include a festival that hopes to have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the recording capacity of the festival is "very big," in the case of about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing has been confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partner from C3, who has won the Top Independent Promoter Award for the latest Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the terminal.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no one is less than the terminal.
These locking attempts are one of the delegated tasks.
A political "heavy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, insists on "Runeway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "government"?
“You must be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find the conditions in Montreal cheap, you will go there.
“Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
Run to the festivals.
Nevertheless, for Denis Turcotte, there is currently a priority for the cinema there.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
On all festivals on the West Coast, despite Sundance, which is from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about presenting Quebec movies, evaluating them, and ensuring producers have interviews.
The dark age had a successful idea at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the post in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange a final year’s rally? Disagreement with experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks to the end of the year at the stock exchange, investors are already shaking their hands in terms of the upcoming final year’s rally.
However, experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically considered, the month of December at the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially when stresses taking seriously determine the current market trend
While other experts have not promised such a strong increase in the last weeks of the year, they noted that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. They are investing mainly in a strongly funded pension funds, which is due to the current trend of assets.
Therefore, according to these experts, the exchanges will have a rather lateral trend that affects market fluctuations, particularly because we are still unable to estimate the extent of the possible decline in the U.S. bank’s interest rate, an uncertainty that leads primarily to the rising oil prices and the risk of rising inflation.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the BPI Sales Department in Spain, agrees that it is a safe time to announce a upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert says.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% since its maximum mark on November 8, 15,945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35, due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional repayment of the pension funds carried out every year for this time, could successfully finish the year with nearly 16,000 points.
However, the expert emphasizes that this year things could develop somewhat differently, especially due to the final year rally that will take place already in the second week of December, and then immediately after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price trends would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a near technical level, which could lead to a shortage of deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
The analyst believes that they are positive.
When choosing the values to advance Ibex to new maximum levels, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney claims that this year the great values are in the row.
Among the value gains, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha by the Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be combined with the banking and industrial sector.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on the upcoming courses in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same way, according to the expert.
With regard to increased consumption during the Christmas Day, the periodic consumption will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in low numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed a decline in two cases.
By the end of 2003, this led the stock exchanges out of their crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real-year rally until now.
This year, when Ibex picked up 35 by 28.17 percentage points, it showed a rate increase of 6.68% in December.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth winning year in consecutive (the Ibex has risen by 8.36%) since January and can also present an end-year rally, it will be shown.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
In total, 200 of them are located in the most economically powerful regions of Spain.
For the institution operating under the brand name Popular Max, these establishments mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular as the first banking group represents the jump is watching to extend the opening hours of its branches on Sundays to 20.30h and apply on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The bank group BBVA, which has also repeatedly read the extension of its opening hours in the establishments, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The bank’s current negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement, where 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturday and open for this on a week afternoon, though not for the customer.
Whether other banks are joining the new initiative that adapts to the business opening hours will depend on the values of the Popular Bank’s experience.
And that’s exactly what popular people are looking for with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the buying-in clientship of independent, small and medium-sized companies, as well as those of large shopping malls.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new, but changed opening hours.
To do this, the Bank will transform the premises of those establishments already in business zones, simultaneously matching the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require greater investments, but that it was associated with an increased staff setting, since a branch now needed no more six, eight or nine employees.
The establishments that will even be equipped with additional spaces for SMEs will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And experience values seemed positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Currently, there are approximately 2500 locations.
And another 60 operating under the name Mundocredit, which are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on sun and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used as most of them will offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have temporarily agreed to sell mobile phones using external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco for the first time doubles its stock exchange value and thus surpasses its rival antenna 3.
We managed to do it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, informed his satisfaction at the closure of the stock exchange. The broadcaster led him had increased his value by double the rate of his rival antenna 3.
However, one aspect pushed his joy: that’s exactly what I was injured; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deeply.
Telecinco ended the day with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%) and Vocento is involved with only 13%.
The rival antenna 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value reaches 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other exchange-noted communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, with Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and with Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with antenna 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, so Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question is how we can actually act technically, at what price and how we can make it profitable at customer level.
Telecinco explained a week ago his project to increase the first television broadcast this year with more than 1,000 million gross revenue from advertising revenues. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project should be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of antenna 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the TV business could only increase by 0.67% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s better exchange rate compared to the high payout rate that the company could have so far: in 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría triggered a 100 percent dividend compensation.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with the mediaset as a parent company, may still vary, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to paying at least 50% of the shares, even if we have been given more and more so far.
I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of endmole shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers has recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a decrease in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.

The Congress agrees to the MIFID Directive which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which concluded its session today with the Senate Congress decision on the amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law, with the intention to allow both regulations to enter into force by the end of the year.
Representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate Members who had pursued the goal in their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible arrangement that ensures investor safety and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities to ensure a generally efficient market event.
The MIFID, which re-establishes the Securities Services Regulation, also follows up with the modernization of the financial markets to improve investor protection, increase the control requirement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialized companies and natural or legal persons to provide financial transfers, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS) to consulting companies associated with the investment and mediation companies of securities.
It also expands the number of financial transaction systems, so that the regulated circulation markets will be added to the multilateral trading systems of effect and to the internationalization of trade contracts, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to inform the focus of their business profile, confrontation and the ways of dealing with risks on the market and register all projects carried out in order to facilitate CNMV’s control flow.
The Economic Commission of the Congress subsequently proposed further changes, making the decision that the titled debts must now be considered as a complex funding for the investor due to their high risk level, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the labour areas of graduate economists; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation was adopted which restricted the labour areas reserved for economists.
The Senate, on the other hand, set new positions in the financial sector, how the economic mediator working on foreign accounts does not require authorisation from CNMV and can offer its services to commercialize products and to acquire customers at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (VPI) has increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator, which serves Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union, delivers the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) that seek a local and quality comparison with US products by providing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared early by using the same approach as the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but at the same time use various other statistical modeling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish statistics (INE) suggested that the previously identified indicator should only serve as an indicative value, and therefore do not agree with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Government Chief and Economy and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, the rise of the VPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes found that even if the current number is not good, Spain’s inflation difference with other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less equal in recent years.
In addition, he explained that in November there were less surprises than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of about 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin will calculate Northern Rock revenue of over €42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s stocks have declined by more than half after the bank had sought an emergency loan by the British bank in mid-September last year, and they are currently only £12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At this time, the bank’s assets were recording £25,000 million, a sum that has declined significantly within two and a half months due to customers’ confidence loss, and also despite the government’s 100 percent guarantee that the money will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue to lead the group under the brand name Virgin Money, has to bring about a quarter of the British banks’ income that will be composed of the investments for the next three years to acquire exactly those £18 billion needed to achieve their 30 billion goals.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his remarkable advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to allow £50,000 million (equivalent to €70 million) to flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock appointed the Virgin Group this week, with three more companies involved than its preferred provider to lead it out of insolvency.
Mayor of Totana arrested for suspected participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the Secretarys of the Municipal Council and the Head of the Municipal Police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented last May the office of Juan Morales, currently deputy of the Popular Party and at the time chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and could, according to the information of the broadcaster Cadena SER, be the original wire manager of the Complot.
Officials continue to review the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales’ attorney was charged with the main suspect discovered in the case of urban corruption at the beginning of this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and thus privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client’s residence due to important loadful documents related to the complot.
Additionally, other sources of information report from the alleged contract payments of Morales to a Galician construction company, which provides for the conclusion of a city-building contract, in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
At present, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE candidature in Toledo and, in case of a election victory, at Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has adopted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which will appoint the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the case of an election victory of the Socialists, take over the office of the President of Congress.
José Blanco, the organizational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono have announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today in the headquarters of the party.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified as it is important in politics to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, the politician from the Mancha in the event of a victory for the socialists in the upcoming elections would seem to be nominated as the president of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of Congress, who had announced on November 15 that he would no longer attend the next general elections to end his career in public policy and instead engage in the university area of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President had continuously forced his return to political events.
In addition, he noted that, as the party, when appointing the Vice President for Economics, does not want to represent the citizens who would take over the posts of the President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the room into a house of respect, not the defeat or the crying, in order to make it more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, you gain the impression that the only place in which you can’t speak calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the president was interrupted once to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and deutered that he did not want to wake up the appearance of having already taken the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to a critical criticism of both the skeptics of climate change, as well as those who put a social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole has to put a strong cohesion on the day.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even suggests to conclude a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal brings it into a statement on the action or non-commerce of its government, which has crucially contributed to the fact that Spain is at the top of the countries that have at least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance of the requirements, which sectors are due to this, and why his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, did not stop this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures provided by him against climate change without any change.
Which companies will be affected by the behavior of the citizens, the individual and collective savings measures to be carried out and the economic consequences of them.
More precisely, who must sacrifice and will be paid for the rescue of the planet.
However, there will be and there will be no such explanations in the future.
That's because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be taken against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol centre proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero seemed strategically so dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Therefore, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his treaties with the planet, the politicians who are otherwise suitable for election campaigns must not speak or accuse or demand, but instead follow the demanding release, decorate the meetings and enthusiastically enthusiastically others with their gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and thus does not require that the bike becomes the only removal means in the future or we only may refresh ourselves with a feather.
The mayor and police chief of Totana were involved in a urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil arrested the mayor of the municipality of Murcia Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, and also the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor office and a hotel entrepreneur were arrested for suspicion of urban violations.
The municipal council was arrested in his residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in its rooms he was so far surrounded by numerous agents who also had access to the municipal administration and the municipal construction direction Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it has been found that more than 2 million hectares of unfinished construction grounds for urban projects should be re-established under the leadership of the Galician construction company Nuaria. These should be legally established on the territory of 4000 apartments for the last period of the local administration.
In addition, two more persons were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation procedure which was invoked and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six arrested have been presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales are also identified.
In addition, his ex-wife, owner of a Totana-registered real estate company, as well as his current, resident girlfriend, are suspected in Murcia.
The Chairman and Owner of the Nuaria Group, Lawyer and Entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the CEO of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company served as a subgroup of Nuaria and was intended to receive the sharp money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further investigations, most of which were in direct connection with the companies in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid)
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm that would have acted as a mediumman.
The construction group Nuaria was assigned to build the largest residential complex of the village belonging to Murcia; it should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of area in Totana, which was intended to rebuild it. The aim was to implement a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar that promote the sale of real estate; Conyase operating in Vigo the parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation.
Things that can happen
Articles 1
If you agree, we will differ from the expression of the month book and instead try to invent a price designation of other names with appropriate competence.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to submit your suggestions.
Articles 2
Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is also at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the commentary published in the same newspaper on November 18.
The content of the science philosophy has become the topic of public debate after the tragedy of Jokela’s school.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturian who cited the works of Platons and Nietzsches in his news.
In an interview with the journal Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Educational Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo urged the teachers to take a more critical position in relation to Plato and proposed to erase the teaching of Plato from the undergraduate curriculum for the Faculty of Philosophy for Gymnassia.
Articles 3
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law that is sentenced to six months of imprisonment.
However, if you withdraw a music business under a value of €400, this is only a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you pull out the business up to a value of €1000, the thief is a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than when you download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you clause a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than when you download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a hit than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebel dispute, a prison sentence of three to 12 months follows (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange consequently takes a six-month free withdrawal to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual disturbance at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. whereas trade in copyrighted films, whose authorization has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher punishment than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should have a right, then someone has made his demands quite high.
IFRS
My home doctor gives me one of his long, weird research articles titled: money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings arising from the monthly salary depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the Science magazine Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and, on the other hand, his colleagues failed.
The researchers realized that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and thus received the same pay; but when one of them received the double, it also resulted in a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The state attorney from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been intactly arrested for eight years after the criminals of the Balkan war. Its office is located in the state prosecutor's office of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Court of La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the chief executives of the massacre of Srebrenica - at the death of eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - the former general Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be free.
Their names are listed by the director Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a presentation for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, Spain not yet recorded); a film that, with the pace of a polit thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor's pressure from Belgrade to New York in their plans to undermine the crimes that have escaped.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers any possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, the amount of which, in turn, depends on various factors, including age, gender, date of manufacture of the driver's license, family status, type of the vehicle to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we have to do with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurer and an insurer.
This Agreement shall be maintained in writing by means of an insurance contract which states that the company receives the contracted insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding amount of the settlement in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, including age, gender, date of the issue of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that even higher contributions will be paid in case of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25 years old and women need to make less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower rate of accident due to their care.
The same applies to married persons as they, according to the statistical values and therefore according to firms, tend to less accidents like singles.
The benefit measured to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting the premium, the insurance needs to take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs most effectively.
We now list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance, in order not only to make a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under the age of 25 meet numerous obstacles in choosing an affordable insurance, such as low driving practice and young driving licence.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full cash insurance, yet there are cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full box with self-employment, so the services of a full box insurance are covered, but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is less than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's Chief Representative at First Europe, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is the advanced insurance that insurances the customer against external accident damages, but not against damages caused by the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your assets increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A asset is a reduction of the basic interest rate in the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an elevation of charges.
The amount of benefits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can allow to increase bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year brand is exceeded, it is easy to conclude a contract for drivers, and the reason for this is that with increasing driving practice, the rate of accident falls.
Therefore, it is best to choose a full cash insurance with self-employment.
Usually, youths cannot benefit from their experience, neither in the case of an accident nor at the time of driving, the Spanish chief of the European company explains, and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner was delayed.
However, with a married customer who does not have children, it is more racial to complete full cash insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned too.
Insured couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest rate of accident, and therefore their contributions are low.
In this case, a full cash insurance with self-employment (about a amount of €300) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, it is recommended that an extended insurance be used only for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed in total and have a larger purchase power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera states.
For retirors, it is offered to complete a full cash insurance with self-employment (about a amount of €150), or an extended insurance that only uses a sufficiently high asset.
Finally, it is necessary to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it provides high costs that require a thorough selection that matches our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the eighth final
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight on Tuesday in San Siro for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals before the end of the Champions League round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while the Scots decide about their participation.
The Italian crew already has five points and has confirmed their participation in the fifth round with an uncertainty in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not receive Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two matches of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan must attend the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will be fighting for the first time in the 13th half-final for the entry into the final held on the 16th.
This group will be completed above all, and the uncertainty at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion to the all-expected outcome, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltic Glasgow knows they would be in the event of a group victory and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan's team could even be enough to qualify for a defeat in a FC Shakhtar lap, but he shouldn't have too much confidence in such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are equal, though they lost their participation in Glasgow last week (2-1), but they could win in the second match (2-0).
Therefore, the Mailanders will try to mix the Scots the evening, and again hope to reach the eighth final of the transformed championship league for the second time in the following, after they have been in exactly the same round in the previous season through a gate of Kaka in the post-play time (1-0) and a zero-to-decision in the game.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on its own game as the achievement of the eighth final and its membership at the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could, despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, win third place and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave 20,000 spectators at Vancouver in Canada for their first tour after the band’s dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) just before the start of their concerting at GM Place de Vancouver.
About the 20,000 people were able to attend the concert at the ex-selling stadium, where a video was shown on the history of the band, which had brought Furore to the end of the nineties.
The reunification and the world tour are overwhelmed by the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and Voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were wearing golden rings on the stage that Posh Spice’s husband, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience that made the GM Palace shine, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
While preparing for the show, Victoria Beckham told us that the British star has never seen our wardrobe once again, and so I’m already very excited about what he’ll hold of the show.
Sporty Spice, whose resignation from the group in 1998 due to internal opinion differences, moved to the group two years later, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the global public’s attitude had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought why not; so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed himself on the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also stated that the disputes have been eliminated, and now all of them are very pleased.
However, many things have changed since the last common appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First, the group was reported by TV broadcaster CTV in a special machine by Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
When she arrived at the airport, the band was received by an army from children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will be held next in California, San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 December and 7 December).
They will enter the scene in Madrid on December 23.
New concerns about natural gas disputes between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is overwhelming between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of Russian fuel exports to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries reduced delivery to EU countries last year.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
“It’s important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gastronomical states in conversations,” Ukraine’s Economic Minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changes in natural gas prices should certainly be linked to our arguments about the amount of transit fees [from Western Europe] over Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom shortened delivery to Ukraine.
This led to a fall of exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas agreements in the world, but a lot of them remain under-developed.
The consequence is that Gazprom supplements its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the controls of the penalty registers for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said outside.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was introduced in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also raised concerns that the Scottish State Health Service has no precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a land wagon was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast in Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out checks prior to recruitment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the Chief Auditor now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Board should take the guidelines of the Criminal Registry Exit to assist employers in checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some staff documents, they were not conducted routinely," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation policies with a high degree before the establishment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign health workers."
BMA Scottish President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could carry out future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the current pre-determining tests of the NHS of Scotland are working well and it is unclear which additional value will provide the recommendations," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1.161 foreign employees, most of which are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, even because the executives had problems identifying those employees who are relying on indefinite time.
The investigation further found that NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been mostly followed.
These include passport, work permits, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for checks before employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, “I was concerned about doing this work in the light of the attack on Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish government, together with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on check-in surveys prior to recruiting all employees - including those from abroad - would be reflected next month of their publication.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has received five awards at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.
Awards were also given to major actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was casted for the role of Curtis, to the director Anton Corbijn, and Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the best main actor for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond artist Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for having put the British film into the world public.
The prizes were given at a ceremony at London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis’ rise to reputation with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-white film - on its soundtrack, The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was rotated for only £3 million.
Nevertheless, he introduced two awards to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, the most well-known for the cult cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and best director.
Rock music was the focus of another prize winner at the ceremony - as Julian Temple's film over Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentary film.
Viggo Mortensen was the award for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenbergs, London, Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in reputation to play hard guys, has received the Richard Harris Award for his excellent contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, currently films Indiana Jones Continue The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the prize named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris who died in 2002.
“There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I had the luck to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my type of man, a great actress of his time, I am really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group, including filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist attack
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their belonging to cells who had planned a coming attack on an oil plant as well as mental and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smoke missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathetics have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a strong 35,000 fast intervention troops to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministry statement, says that 18 of the arrested were one of the cells led by a missile expert who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reported that the military had planned to enter eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, 22 other prisoners had planned to kill mental and security forces.
The government has warned spiritually to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join Iraq with Al Qaida milices who want to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim Government, which the Hardliners consider to be Ketzery among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida milices consider many spirituals in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that the government dominates.
The police, accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia, targeted it to the prowest Saudi government, have taken it apart from foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very large effort by the security forces over the last five months," a spokesman from the Ministry of Interior told the state television.
The arrests also concern a 16-medical "medical cell" from Medina, which aims to promote the "Takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, supporting violence against Muslims that are burned as unbelievers and abhorrents.
Among the detained were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the police.
The climate on the Venus could see a view of the future of the Earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on a circuit show that the planet is even more similar to a remote twin of the Earth than it has been conscious of.
The Venus is the closest planetary neighbour on Earth.
The two worlds have the same size and have similar planet trails, but the Venus of the Sun is slightly closer.
Billions of years ago, the Venus would have dominated conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even be inhabitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unbreakable carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, Venus introduced a very different course of development.
Today, the planet is depleted by water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt bleeding and is destroyed by hurricane-stretched winds and flashing storms.
The findings of the Venus Express spacecraft from the European Space Agency, which has studied the plants for a year, provide an extensive view of how the Earth could develop in the face of disastrous climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on the Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets are quite similar otherwise."
“Our new data enables us to build a scenario in which the Venus has started billions of years ago like the Earth, perhaps with an habitable environment.”
"Assured uranium" by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, according to reports enriched uranium, was captured yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was tested.
He did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
With Romey said he did not think it was worthy to be interrogated by a snowman.
However, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally agreed to put a debate on YouTube, where normal voters record video questions and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the Democrats questioned about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican party that will break in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN who supported the debate with selecting YouTube clips to show up to the candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest dedicated to a single subject, immigration was at the center.
The topic is one of the most critical topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of uncertain voters to use a record when they heard things they liked: The TV institute noticed the tops of approval as the candidates spoke strictly over the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national predecessor, and Romney, who went forward in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to dismiss the reputation that he was passionate about illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having settled illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly strong as questionnaire asking whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would provide a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congress Deputy, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress Deputy from Colorado, managed to pursue this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they’ve crushed earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates share the same views in larger and entirely: tighter boundaries, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears of toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics were brought into the language.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated eruption should be regarded as torture.
One questionnaire asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the Wal.
Another questionnaire asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now in contrast to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said the death penalty was painful, but necessary.
When he was pressed on whether Jesus would promote them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely open.
Huckabees’ rise in Iowa falls along with Ron Paul’s recent donations and his casual storms in the debate on Wednesday.
These two are shot out of nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincingly combined with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinker to the two wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far unclear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another cave to fall; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly sharp.
No award-winning titles appear to be sold, no politicians pay Paris hotel bills, no extra-marriage bills have been betrayed.
But the discovery that a rich businessman donated to the British labour party over £650,000 (1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party failed to report this is something without the defeated Gordon Brown would have done well.
When the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the demand for a election two months ago, in a dirty way insulting the intelligence of the British, claiming that opinion surveys had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp representation president of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean developed.
The uncertain rescue of Northern Rock, an attacked bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgmental capabilities.
Badly thought proposals to amend tax laws have made corporate associations against the government.
The tax official loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative squads.
A trio of generals in retirement started an uprising in the upper house with protests against cuts of military expenditure: being minister of arms, they claimed to be part-time work.
Now there are various donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary-General (and her former executive director) has already resigned.
Nothing means that Brown is resigning irrevocably.
However, governments can reach a turning point after which they cannot feel it.
Neither do people like or trust politicians, but they usually keep their scepticism back when a new force captures the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this rise is over: the public service begins to become, the cabinet ministers begin to blow up; the press seeks bad news; and the government will be defensive and ziellos.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he can’t claim to be a new boss.
As he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his Lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax liability documents, for example, depend on decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's mischief - like the long "money for award titles" survey of political party funding - the voters may assume that he was.
Brown's situation isn't as bad as she looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was totally disappointed.
And the remedy, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course have always promised Stalinist trends: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new testimony about political donations is a good example.
The garboy Abraham, who compares his donations with his generous gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his well-being.
Maybe that's the case, but the decision didn't come to him.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who said he would have known about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendleson, Labour’s chief finance manager, who was told about the inalienable donations in October.
However, Brown has not been involved so far: there is nothing that indicates that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly convicted the violation of the laws by his party, but he distorted this determination by grabbing a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - to complete the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "drawing teachings" are not very complicated.
When the law is broken, it is one thing for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, like finding something to a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, which has been unemployed for six months, and to advance with a cross-border reform of political party funding.
This would require the Labour's hardliners to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party owner like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in opinion surveys; he has two years to regain voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unfair justice and solid competence.
Cardnhaie
Does the American credit card market start?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that the back floats are excited to turn around.
Now that America’s real estate market has violated, the robbers have the country’s credit card market in visibility.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of contamination of underfined loans spreads to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in expenditure and in sewing rates that measure the share of loans, which are not admissible or are too late for more than 30 days.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion from its U.S. consumer funding, partly due to the weakness of credit card users.
It’s too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the Moody Rating Agency, the third-quarter selling rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The worsening of the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
An amendment to the U.S. private insolvency law in 2005 led to a sudden case of competition claims, which in turn constitute a large portion of the card losses; the number of claims (and thus drinking fees) would again increase whether the general conditions for creditors are deteriorating or not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much consumers pay off their debts each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the interruption in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the emissions for 2007 will eventually be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infectious channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certainly there: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debts now that household loans are dried out.
However, the cardmakers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling home prices do not necessarily make a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even benefit the cardmakers.
The incentives for consumers who continue to pay the mortgage rates fall when the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts under the repayment priorities become more important.
Card exchangers can also respond much faster and more flexible than borrowers by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid asset revaluation.
“We won’t wake up one day and evaluate the loans completely,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial reporter.
Even if a sudden under-covering crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable decline are significantly more realistic.
If lower home prices and a reduction in loans are pushing America into the recession, the industry will undoubtedly be facing a worse future.
Continue to look at these haefish floats.
British bankers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were to be faced in court for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief finance manager Andrew Fastow, changed their efforts on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pledged for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich himself at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was implemented in January.
But during a hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone was guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in the UK during two years of delivery processes.
In the United States, its case is a loss end of an investigation, which was launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Fastow’s initial charges against them in 2002 noted that it was the goal of a government investigation in connection with the Enron fall.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to hide a fraudulent complot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary company of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron crafts that have contributed to breaking the company into the competition.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had valued its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it had a significant value in reality.
A company under Kopers control acquired the bank’s shares at the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for participation in this company.
Fastow falsely accused Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and other $12.3 million, according to the charge.
Fastow, known in January 2004, blamed himself for conspiracy in two points for his role in Enron's pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is sentenced to six years in Louisiana’s federal prison.
Copper is sentenced to three years and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on foot on the basis of a $1 million deposit that made it necessary to live in the United States in expectation of the court proceedings.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh largest company, broke out in the competition in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer sharpen billions of debts or make weakening undertakings seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than $2 billion pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their roles in Enron's collapse.
Skilling is a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were denied after he died last year of heart disease.
Not entirely below in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient reach to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream on last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of the displayed consumption, which was organized in a stunning exhibition centre near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest Russians who came to money in everything, from yachts of Mahagoni tables to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer took care of a brilliant orange porsche at the next exhibition stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.”
Heated by an olive tree, the Russian capital appears to be so flooded with money like Dallas to its brilliant times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to the gigantic wealth and went to many to Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasical Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflowers in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the world’s most visible free-to-be money publishers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of golden smoke.
In other words, this week, in Moscow, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high-cost goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires owned $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are included in the second class, worth $670 billion together, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert cream here.
(The World Bank says that 15.8% of Russians lived below the minimum of existence in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelryman.
She first visited the fair with the Russian brand trader, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all kinds of cared for, and men are all worth a wealth."
While traveling through the halls in evening dress, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she weared, like a red tape veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to focus on the novelties, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand several hours in dust to visit a stunning storage house, the Cadillac Escalades, pocket knife made of platinum, movenpick eiskrem, customized appliances in billard.
The public could buy tickets for $30 ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," Mr. Gijrath, who patrioticly sat at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a hand-painted, blue mosaic stone painting.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climb climbs."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of narrow brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, sent by millionaires or simply tourists, forced the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, Managing Director General of King Koil Bedten, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of seed, cashmir and cotton, with enriched gold feathers.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company sold the grey orange porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, told a company that he had sold three car cooling grids for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same chained tyres, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spices he had covered with colorful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for a quarter.
"The Russian millionaire, the foreign leather wheel, or a picture of his wife's face from Cuban zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," Karapetian said.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40 cars garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in the real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich in a state operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set four red telephone cells according to British models, which were filled with mountains of false million dollars cards.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers continued to throw around the coins, mobile phone photographs while refusing to cut off from friends, or simply to get a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Exploited operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest when Ronald Livingston saw the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance on the White Cape Cod hanging two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Soon afterwards there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the carriage of the medical body visitor coming," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone was dead.”
The authorities found that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant of the Newarker Police Desert.
Now, the investigators try to determine if she died of a procedure carried out by a unacceptable cosmetic surgeon that was not identified by the police and worked in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what caused Mrs. Arroyo’s death, and are hoping that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to discover a mysterious death that sent a sadness by the head of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo has been an assistant of the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and harsh," Mr. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer working for the alcohol control committee, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unaccepted surgical treatment.
“This is one of the possibilities,” said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have notified little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether a part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castros’ house, where a magnificent pink straw is standing in the narrow garden and a Dalmatian sits behind the house.
A blue thread labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the bottom floor.
Two mountain bicycles on one side of hakens.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him to deal with provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,' he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I went.
It was sad."
Hoping that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to a rise in the world stock markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets through further interest rate reductions, strengthened by controversial comments by the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, President of the Central Bank, said that politics must "flexibly and pragmaticly" respond to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm up sad markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "particularly reversed some of the improvements of the market functions from late September and October".
If increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further aggravation of the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were captured by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter the US markets and stabilize the credit conditions with new capital injections.
The performances also helped the Wall Street calm down, given other bad news from the U.S. economy, now that the sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence have been underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of its global employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate severe losses from their lost bets in the U.S. mortgage loan sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13,289,40, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, which added more than £39 billion to the value of British standard values.
Germany’s index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the re-apparition of credit pressure on the markets had been emphasized after a strong demand for an auction of the European Central Bank's three-month guarantee funds granted to the European Trade Banks was given to a noteworthy 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and put further capital funds into the money markets in London increased when the three-month "Libor" credit rates to borrow between UK banks increased by 6.59 percent to their maximum since late September 21.
England faces decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who wants to beat number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, Chairman of the Elections, is here to help the Chieftrain Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide on this, and because the table of High Morries, the English Executive Director, gradually with applications for national voters.
Anyone who does not get the sixth shot position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to fix precisely what allows a person to reach the top of his craftsmanship, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where choice is difficult, where judgments are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to get to Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good degrees that know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great impact on decisions, but chances are also.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a kidnapper must get regular chances in order if he wants to impress as a day-to-day cricket player.
Capturing the eyes of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than James Anderson, who appears to play in the first test, even when Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind climbed into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their brilliance points and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium, it can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the career of both men, or maybe it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood was still struggling to confirm the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although scored a double hundred against Australia, is still underestimated.
Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores are likely to follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feelings for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks of his brilliant and valuable 88 test debut initiations in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger than seven years old, and an excellent balance against rounded balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his homemade as a Middlesex player, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the exchangers as Vaughan, was healthy to take back his position for the next game, appears to have taken the swim from his strike that was still open in Bombay.
On the contrary, the son of Essex enjoys life.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket spot and his attitude was taken away from it when he recently overwhelmed a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffers from smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick up his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from the remote, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen that?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he cuts his average pace with some effect here on the gaming fields, which seems to fit him and hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time.
Maybe that’s the real art of choosing.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean Shah maybe won't stand well if, as the tea set of Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and fight Al-Qaida
The first bus loading of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of distributors whose funds or visa have gone out, and others who hoped the city would return to normality.
Some even came back to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni physician.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Bagdad and how it would be safe now.”
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, as regards the Shiite militant clergy Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to resign his forces for the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shit teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariyah called him to tell him that a U.S.-supported local militia has helped expel Al-Qaeda from her bastion to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who had been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand-granate attack after he had called his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started the anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many have told them that they have been trapped by the growing calm in the capital since the U.S. troops’ rise and the growth of local “groups affected” citizens who are armed and in cooperation with the U.S. military defending their city district.
But more people said they had been forced to go home by visa problems and sealing funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister who had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably escaped from the Sectorial deaths in the country.
"We went well to al-Maliki visit Syria and the government no longer forced Iraqis to give visa to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni retired said.
“I can’t trust a government supporting the criminals who burned my house after I left.”
A part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunni were displaced from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will resurface sectoral tensions and conflicts will occur.
Small Island, good education
The smallest federal country is leading in vocational training and even shine with the international direction of its high schools.
Only in one field of education, the Saar countries express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Saar country yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan posted the smallest federal country self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the educational system of the Saarland, which is fifth in the educational monitor of the German Institute of Economics Köln (IW).
Thus, the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can graduate with a double or even triple degree here.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is high with 15.6 percent.
However, the country’s children also bring the Saarland to high school in excess of an average number - many of them without a graduation in high school.
"In Saarland, you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plunnecke, an education expert at IW.
More than every five youth acquires their study qualification at a vocational school, so that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combinations of vocational and academic training are also relatively strongly expanded.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering sciences.
"In the schools in general, after the first Pisa study, we have made some reforms," said a spokeswoman of the Ministry of Education.
This is how the government introduced country-wide comparison tests.
In order to begin learning children earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is currently copying other federal countries as well.
Whether the performances of students are improved sustainably, only future comparison studies will be shown.
At Pisa in 2003, the percentage of risk students increased from 29 to 20 percent.
In general, however, Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal countries.
The Bayern expect better.
And for the destruction of the Saar countries, foreign language knowledge in Pisa will not be measured - in this area you could otherwise point out.
Because the language of the neighbours is a duty to gymnasium - even though the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez turns the watches around
In Venezuela, the watches will be ticked differently from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will return the time knives in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke.
According to the Venezuelan official newspaper, according to a new law, the watches will be set to the world time in less than four and a half hours.
This means that the South American state has a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of America would impose the allocation in full-time zones.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) due to a breakdown of relations with neighbouring Colombia.
The left nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not discuss relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform, about which the citizens of Oilland must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, where it was the release of prisoners.
Uribe had "smitten the face of Venezuela" with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is in all mouth.
A new phone rington in the country provides Furore: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth) is the phrase that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who had been generous at the recent Ibero-American summit of the constant intercourse of the left-populist, and who had driven through the mouth.
Germans threatened 2007 payminus
Despite the strong economy, German workers are threatening a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could expect less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price shifts in food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economics Research of the "Image".
New burdens could also be taken to worker unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker newspaper" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3% to the annual change is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not come back in embarrassment to have to ask for loans or subsidies at the federation, the SPD politician was cited.
It was announced on Tuesday that the price of food and mineral oil products exploded at the highest rate of inflation for 13 years.
In total, prices rose by 3.0% in comparison with the year.
Venus is the wooden twin of the Earth
The Venus, despite its life-threatening atmosphere on Earth, is more similar to what it had previously thought: the European space sonda "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and windstorms in Poland as they appear on Earth in the winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is shining on the Venus.
Now the European sondage "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles, Science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen Theory", flashes have caused life to emerge on Earth: winds have been supposed to have stimulated the reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on the Venus: “If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history,” Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington explains.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of the Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes it rules under temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's change on Earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has created such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since the early 1990s no sonde was going to explore this planet.
The latest research results, now presented in several "nature" articles, highlight not only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
“They also show that the communities of our neighbouring planet with Earth are larger than they were first accepted,” the ESA said.
Thus, the researchers found, alongside the already known wire wind at the North Pole, a cloud trolley at the South Pole, which turns even faster.
The phenomenon resembles air streams on the earth's winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second smallest planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as morning or evening star, circles around the sun in nearly 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a Venus day takes 243 earthdays.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar scarcely resemble the Earth, scientists assume that both planets are created under completely similar conditions.
On both the water that remained on the earth was gathered in oceans, but on the Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbon stones, it produces most of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler requests the end of the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for his attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler takes care of Germany's reputation and has called for the great coalition to end the fighting for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outside world in this regard a split nation," Köhler told the trade paper.
At the same time, Köhler signaled an understanding of receiving the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Men’s rights have universal validity for me, even though I respect the difference between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany needs to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the claim that it operates a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not taken a distance from traditional Chinese policy.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly recognized disturbance over the receipt of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by Union rows.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained of the Union's "schopeenster policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor Ram, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only called on the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to SPIEGEL’s information.
China’s head of government, Wen Jiabao, has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China refuses when European politicians receive the religious leaders of the Tibetans in official position, confirming the Chinese position of Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he attempted to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other today’s provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns from cravings like in France
Road shafts with police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns from cravings like in France.
It is necessary to do everything so that social dissatisfaction in Germany will not be dismissed in violence on the streets, the Federal Interior Minister said.
Barrikans fired, randals shot with sneakers on police: After the heavy youth cravings in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) feared similar developments in Germany.
“We need to be careful that social explosives are not built and displaced in violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he said in Hannover, the New Press.
Not every young man faces the rapid change of social reality.
The union, countries and municipalities have already worked with the emphasis on reducing problems, Schäuble said.
This concerns not only the integration of migrants.
“From the summit of integration to the Islamic conference, this is already the first success.”
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German municipalities there are no urban and sociological problems such as France.
In the northern prefectures of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street strikes with the police last night.
Also burned cars and public buildings in Toulouse.
More integration efforts by the federal government, instead, demanded the President of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the Krawalle in France, Kolat warned against "second effects".
Although the situation in Germany is not as brewing as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people under 25 years of age is "average high".
Most importantly, it is necessary to provide more training places.
Kolat emphasized: “We need to give youth a perspective.”
However, the President of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than France takes place "social control in the families".
Many young people with migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, “But we must be careful.”
Youths should be “speakly given the opportunity to participate in work and training”.
Meanwhile, it remained largely calm at the night in the Paris district Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter flew over the area with shining fans.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning wastewaters and cars.
Since last day, an order of about 1,000 security forces has been made to rest.
The police will intervene as long as it is necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the predecessor.
On Tuesday night at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured.
Following, the disturbances attacked Toulouse.
The cravings were inflamed in a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor’s office, the police do not blame the death of the youth.
In the Empire of Angela Cloud
The real-life appearance of the Chancellor documents that the coalition is ending content - and that nothing can be expected by itself.
In what country does this Federal Chancellor actually live?
After her unconsoled appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was fuzzy and poor, you must say: not here - not in the country that she should finally be governed by.
Angela Merkel has rejected the claim that she is too focused on foreign policy with an angry phrase.
This is provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for everyone how much their claim applies.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Cloude presented himself: a lifted politician who fled to foreign policy and still remains in danger there.
Example Climate Protection: It is uncomfortable to praise the decisions of Saint Damm, but does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this regard.
Of course, the self-love - so much distressingness would have failed by the CDU boss two years ago.
Now she clings to the flooding that the rise comes to the people.
So she damages her image as a pragmatic woman who solves the problems rather than make the world beautiful.
But in the reign of Angela Cloud, internal political problems are a random phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-income?
A few additional items were left for it.
It is important to note how often she promises when it comes to the kidnapping.
There are three steps that Merkel needs to get out of a semi-way straight sentence.
It is like a foreign land when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have a hard sharp exchange – and now have to be afraid of an outside candidate.
The effort of the candidates is already delayed at the first subject.
He has made New York a "place for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney suggests his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
He, on the other hand, contradicts severe allegations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegal," responded Giuliani and suggests to the former governor of Massachusetts to have occupied private immigrants without papers.
Candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favours, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-produced 30-second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are almost more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism we have let Hitler come to power,” John McCain suggests to his counterpart Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also receives the Vietnamese veteran strongly reading the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation simulating drinks as torture.
However, that the main topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq war and torture debates, the reactions of the hall audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are honored and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium’s aids appear.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I've worried about myself at that time," Romney said, breaking down and making abbits in front of the base and television audience that he was still among the advocates of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the Slingers when he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civilian
One day after his resignation as head of army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was appointed as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has been charged on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony in the President's palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as army head to his familiar Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus rejected international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after his detention in a bloody military coup, the former general now rules as a civilian head.
With his resignation as chief commander of the army forces, Musharraf had met a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the end of the exceptional state which Musharraf had imposed on November 3.
Soon after his defence, Musharraf, according to Prosecutor-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will revoke the exceptional state and thus meet another demand for the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with a weighted lawyers in early November, had rejected all claims against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribe region of North-Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four others were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the herb return
Germany’s Supergroup of the Seventh Years Music Again: The three band members of Harmonia introduced their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival appears an average of her great time "Live 1974".
Since then, they have been much more famous abroad.
The inherited sensation then occurs in the form of three masters placed at the dinner table.
Each has its boxes in front of himself, its cables, and especially its buttons.
Dieter Moebius threw in the flower white shirt at 63 years of age in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed by the Auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated on the console.
Everybody contributes to noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the masters themselves.
That the band Harmonia has been musicing again, has provided some excitement among herb lovers.
What you can reveal here: targeted demands indicate that although the name has sworn through collective pop memory, it is not so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the Germans also celebrate his living legends from the Seventh Years?
In England and America, what is deceitful is always more important than in their own country.
When the music economy gave the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003 the Echo Award for Lifework, they were seen in the hall in questioning German pop viewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers still thanked La Düsseldorf and New! bands in the Laudatio, the admiration didn’t know any limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later hit Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old friend.
The problem of home ignorance and declaration in foreign countries is one.
The memory is therefore overwhelmed with harmony because the trio existed for only two years and at that time also developed a much lower effect power than they were assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
First, it was played in the keller under the Berlin scene.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label held by the church.
Rother had recently assisted at power plants and then played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians to exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as urban fleeting municipalities.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius had to suffer as a child girl.
Rather in an incredible artist's day.
It is alleged that in the lock mill was also a wimbled of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of them liked harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so the music sounded and modest, the band suffered material distress.
The travel collection was not serving only to self-confidence.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was cut together at a concert in Griessem, before a nearly 50-headed recording course, as someone believes to ensnare.
From Rother then came the desire to forcise harmony and exercise occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius a non-partial demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric spheres and secured his existence with albums such as "flaming hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since it was harmony.
The Grissemer live album is Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its plate company Greenland aims to maintain the herb rock as a pure German contribution to live music.
New! was already buried like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of the Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidised, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Love Parade inventor Dr. Motte.
This means that the entire bandwidth of the influences of the herb rock would be crossed to the following pop music.
With Harmonia, the supergroup’s vacuum site is filled.
Brian Eno’s phrase is the most unique sounds in the hall: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are images that show producers harmony in the farm class.
The legend formation serves projections of other black-white photos of wire-cable devices.
Before that, the three veterans were again dealing with improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and to the strike to unlock the instruments through self-equipped power devices unheard of sounds.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technical deepeners.
There is no change in the choir of the house.
Under the guidance of Barbara morning stars, sound clouds are crushed and crushed and singing at a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Grautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were searched less in blues than in music schools (Can), technology (powerwork) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls "'68!" isn't completely wrong, and harmony can't get it out of rest even now.
The most obvious thing is carefully reflected on the scene.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob the nerves of a person or give him great luck to flying moments.
Richard Gere is not cynic enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Morderic Peace" two films are engaged in the Balkan War again.
But both do not convince.
Or the concepts put too much on action and packaging, or they are too touching.
Richard Gere can't help in The Hunting Party.
The good news first: although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the 1980s lately out of sight because too many of the fun roles in well-being films for women and too many of the press conferences on the subject of Buddhism gave him the pleasure to see.
Now, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the Hunting Party is Going to Hunt" (why do film titles have to be so long today and we might be as long as local leader tariff treaties?).
He provides a wonderful eye-skinning picture: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt was what could have been made from Gere if the fate and the film industry weren’t so compassionate: a man who had his best times long behind him, but even as a ruined memory of his fall, still has significant remains of the instigating charm.
But despite this Trumpfess, "The Hunting Party" continues along with the German production of "Modern Peace", which also begins this week, only the endless series of missing Balkan war films.
With "Morderic Peace" you can do a short process: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), which saves a Serbian from Kosovo's firearms, which also falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not represented here as the only root of all evils, the television film is lost too quickly in packaging and action.
There remains a kind of "alert for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the contrary, "The Hunting Party" can be quite exemplarized why there has never been a really good Balkan war film before.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who emerged to detect the Serbian supreme war crimes "der Fuchs" would be able to become a new "apocalypse now" with another director and another script author (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories look as if they were, both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military cannot do, and both times it will be a trip to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downside cynics with the heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must still think about a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnier.
Finally, “The Hunting Party” falls down when reporters succeed in the last five minutes of the time raffle procedure, what NATO, CIA and all the world’s captains have failed in five years: they catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge.
This is so bad that you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to claim Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should be exceptionally agreeing) not to carry out the persecution due to secret political agreements too intensely.
But good communion and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous poem of law comes into mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I feel compassionate to see the wrapped stairs, indicating how hard it is to be bad."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have precisely such sweat heads that indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, the newspaper reported that all the Iraq films were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film before.
Almost always it is true: if a star runs around the world's crisis herds or mining fields, then something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "Just of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All of the conflicts may be too close to time.
It had to pass decades before Hollywood with "Schindler's List" could turn a good film about the Holocaust.
Some films will probably still be mature - the classical Vietnam-works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated once again as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe we know today, where every mass murder in real time comes home on just two screens, also simply too much about the world’s conflicts.
And that ruins the script writers the uncertainty they need to tell good stories.
"He or not his" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic-distanced artistic view of Romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned in parallel between his historical novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkan war, he replied, "This is just because some things never change.
Great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be killed in a grey manner and will always rule war in Yugoslavia."
Reviewed by Beust for Olympia Refuge
The resignation of the Mayor from Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympics has been criticized in politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But from Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief business director of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, described a resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivation forces in the city as the Olympics.
Without this goal, the sport political vibration could not be maintained in the same manner.
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "which comes out of a changed time stream".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained in previous statements on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistically at least by 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides about an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Association," Beust WELT ONLINE said.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Association for the early December on a Munich application for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have previously thought of by 2028.”
However, the dream isn’t forever exhausted,” Beust said.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will raise the impression that Hamburg will no longer want to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by buriing the plans already at that time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A rejection of the application is also in opposition to the statement of the Senate Chief on the occasion of a receipt of a plenary assembly of the General German High School Sports Association.
There, Beust has called the Hamburg application for the Universiade 2015 "not as a replacement" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
The high school sports association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group proposed to the Senate not to have used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he put on the map of Olympia and broke out the housing construction," SPD deputy Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Small Grasbrook has always requested an integrated planning for Olympia and later use of residence, the CDU has placed one-sided on the “event factor”.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at its time had a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the terms of Sweden and wooden boxes thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or isn't it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden throw dark shades on Warhol’s work directory.
A large portion of the ninety-nine brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has raised doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to an extensive result: the six "Brillo Boxes of Arts", which are part of the international art of Stockholm, the former museum director, Pontus Hultén, has also been awarded to Koenburg as the Moderna Museum in 1995.
The prehistory is confused, a confusing chain of artistic and curative productions.
In 1964, Warhol in New York created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the soap cartons "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - made hundreds of brillo boxes made of paper: these came from (for costs) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the brillo carton factory.
It was not artworks, but their patterns, just exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol in 1968 has probably granted permission to produce a few brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but not exhibited at the Moderna Museum.
Time witnesses now speak about about fifteen boxes that were then authorized as original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes called "Typ Stockholm" in art and auction history.
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem now is that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and released in 1968 about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 boxes of Hulténs were produced in Malmö until 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol was dead for three years at that time.
Lars Byström, the chief conservator at the Moderna Museum, also studied three of the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, two of which were made in 1968 in Stockholm: their printing plates were only founded and scratched, then white oil color was applied with a pinsel.
The structure of the copies from the 1990s, however, indicates that the color with a paint roll was applied directly to the press press plate - it is not oil, but acrylic color.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museum, says: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to an end as a different position, the Kopi Seeds will become classical in its six boxes."
In July, the Authentication Board has announced to follow the "grave charges" raised in matters of soap powder boxes.
But since then, you must be silent there.
Rebellying soldiers in Manila
The Philippines have abandoned rebellious soldiers who have dispatched at a hotel in Manila and have requested the collapse of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, President Antonio Trillanes, who alleged corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government soldiers had previously crashed the hotel under tear gas intervention.
The two dozen soldiers had differed in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the court on Thursday due to a missing attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly stop with about 30 sympathetics.
The military police officers, who should actually guard him, seemed to have crossed to him and joined his opposition.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and called for the killing of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces shut down the district around the hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously ordered the elite unit of Scout Rangers, said that other army units would soon join the march.
Government critics had called for too large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Their government has been overvalued for months by corruption plans.
In 2003, Manila’s financial district was the main stage of the attempted meuteries of about 200 military personnel against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours of refusal to join the army.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts to push against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company reported on Wednesday night.
It is now holding 20.05 percent of the basic capital.
It was previously speculated about an acquisition.
The option remains open to increase the share of seedlings.
The step is to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Berenberg Bank increased its participation at the Düsseldorf Network Operator by another 5% to 15.1%.
The cash house held the shares only for a third party, it said in the financial market.
The United Internet had already participated with nearly 10% of the mobile broadcasting company Drillisch.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of the United has purchased the Internet for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have initiated discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
“We strengthen our partnership,” explained a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies have founded the community company MSP to take over the freenet competitors.
First, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of about 10 percent of freenet and do not make use of their right to take another 18.49 percent of freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, particularly increasing the participation of Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership were ended in mid-November.
The freenet poker that has been lasting for months and still hard to see is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone contracts and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch had just 6.01 percent of freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring about 4% more.
The right to buy 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
