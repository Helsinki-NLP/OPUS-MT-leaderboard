Politicians in Wales are afraid of "like shit"
Some members of the Welsh National Assembly were terrified of a proposal to change their title into MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has emerged due to plans to change the Assembly's name to Welsh Parliament (the Welsh Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the change in names could cause laughter.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was worried because "it rides on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Wales twp means shit, and pwp means shit.
A member of the party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fools).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently making a legislative proposal for the adoption of the appointments, said: "The final decision on appointments that Members of Parliament will receive, of course, depends on the Members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a wide view of calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (Wales parliamentary Members) or WMPs, but the MWP's possibility was made most appealing in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to propose alternatives, but the struggle to reach agreement can be difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to make a bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
The draft legislation on reforms contains other changes in the way on which the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of the AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on what they should call when the bill is discussed.
Macedonians vote on change in the country's name
Voters vote on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is held in an attempt to resolve a decade of conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has their own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name is a demand for Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's efforts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opponent of the vote and says he will submit to the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of names is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's watches remain silent while the churches in Harlem fight
"The elderly people I have spoken to say that in old days there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it was understandable that the bars disappeared.
"People socialize in other ways today," he said.
"Bars no longer constitute the neighborhood's living room, where people enter on a daily basis."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money inherent to sell assets does not last long, and that "they are back sooner or later from where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who do not help the returning deadlines of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people buying property apartments in these buildings is white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches finally close completely, because it is unlikely that most people who move into property apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodology community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the top of a boycott of stores on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building severely, but when Father Johnson's sonchildren planned to restore the building, they ordered the watch game.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the watch game "the poor watches".
The expert who played at the clock game in June called it something else: "a cultural tax" and "an unreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest watch game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been played in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and architects, some of them acquired by the leaders of the church, some of them by the Bishops.
The Council of the Congregation – the leading body of the Socket, consisting of leading arbitrs – wrote in July to the Bishop of concerns that the Bishop would "supply to push forward the expenditure" to the Council of the Congregation, although the Council had not been involved in recruiting the architects and architects that the Bishop sent to the Bishop.
Some of the members of the congregation complained about lack of transparency by the Bishop.
Haj damages 13-year-old diving after hummers in California
A hae attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he hit for hummers in California on the first day of the hummer season, officials say.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been dying with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting in help and then with a group padded to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just an excitement to catch a hummer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I was prayed!
I was prayed!"
"The whole of his knife was broken up," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water, ‘There’s a cave in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in a critical state.
It is unknown what kind of hair attacks.
Life savior Larry Giles said in a media browsing that there was seen a ham in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on his upper torso.
Officers closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security purposes and to conduct surveys.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 hajars in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury’s takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lines of beauty products with special assistants in the style of storm magazines.
As part of a large effort to take into account the UK’s beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger lines of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be successful.
Investment in beauty products occurs as the supermarkets are looking for new products for shelves used for television, microwave, and housing products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in style with them, seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts a range of Boutique make-up, so most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
The Fragrance Shop also tests perfume shop in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later the year.
Online shopping and development towards purchasing small amounts of food daily in local merchants means that supermarkets should do more to make people visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will look like stores, so that the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains of Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of food products and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous supermarket attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended with a dispute on how the earnings from the pharmacies in the supermarkets were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sales of their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional assortment of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the appearance and decoration of our lines of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our selection of brands is designed to fit all the needs and the exciting environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way to shop.”
Peter Jones "resent" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement to £11 million
Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones left "reasonable" after television host Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement to £11 million with his lifestyle fire to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' De-Star Peter Jones angry after she withdraws from their luxurious lifestyle fire in the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “raising,” as the popular television woman during a stressed meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones fled from the UK to one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she should deal with in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the report from the This Morning host, amongst the UK’s highest profit stars, can cost the company millions because of large investments in products – all from powder to stearin lights to clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and the householder Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as the Board of Directors in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is the brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin hosted by ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones last night said, "We couldn't comment on his business."
Hard to talk, "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the news media to give a comment that "is not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his parish a great news.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a further meeting after Trump shouted their first meeting in Singapore in June as a huge step towards North Korea’s nuclear destruction.
But the negotiations on nuclear destruction have been ongoing.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “equivalent reaction” from the United States in relation to North Korea’s initial action against disarmament.
He noted that the U.S. instead continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in the speech at his election meeting.
“It’s really good with North Korea,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim had generated positive results – the end of the missile, helping to release guns and returning earthquake residues from U.S. military.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this closely packed area, we would have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake warrior islands and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organizations, for example, reported that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population was homeless, the national disaster situation was not declared, which is a prerequisite for international emergency calling.
"In many cases, it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children compiling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unsure whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Disaster, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency action.
Due to the earthquakes, to which Indonesia is constantly exposed, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
There are tsunami refugees built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastal lines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami missing, and it has likely affected the death rate.
Even in the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat the earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new place of accident.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s lack of infrastructure a central point in his election struggle, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and two-ways.
However, the Jokos administration has been distressed by lack of funding in line with the next year's election campaign.
Mr. Joko also experiences pressure from underlying Sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith for themselves.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim bands fought on the streets with machetes, bue and pillars and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge last minute compensates against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score on the 89th Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot against the remote stairs.
The ball flew high above the field towards the upper right corner of the network.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
"It was just about getting into the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch, I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea scored 1-0 at halfway, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker returned with his helmet to Mateo Kovacic before he lifted the speed on the middle of the trail and sprinted into Liverpool's pioneer half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the middle track.
He then made a long release that brought Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and ended up against the remote pillar with a shot with the left foot over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the group game in the Champions League on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays Videoton at UEFA Europe Leaguge on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death rate of tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, reports the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
Many were reported to have been arrested in the mural brokers of buildings falling after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the judge's scale, which hit on Friday and created waves up to 6 meters high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by wall brokers from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man of 32 suspected of murder after a woman was sentenced to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at Grayson Mews at John Street at 7:55. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police have invited people in the area who have seen or heard something about moving forward.
Police assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I will encourage everyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious of contacting us.
I would also like to urge everyone, particularly taxi drivers who may have taken up something with dashcam, to contact us because they can have information that can be crucial for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think to know the woman came to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say they are on the way to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but let the police know that no one should enter the building.
He was sick when he heard what had happened.
The people now know that there are several hours before they can get in again.
A police officer was interrogated to say to a man that the whole area is now considered a crime place.
A crying woman arrives.
She continues to repeat, "it's so terrifying."
At 14:00 there were two police cars within the shutdown and another car just outside.
A number of police officers were standing within the suspension and supervised the apartment complex.
Please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and notify log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the most recent memory of discussion on the "reconstruction of history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposals as "smallness" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster palace would become a goal.
The image storm during the British Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas’ actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning image of Cromwell is a testimony of attitudes in the 19th century and part of the historyography of a figure, which many still think it is worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is a precise imagination is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure representing one side of the battle.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worthy of honour and remembrance.”
Assaults and kills Chinese farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a overwhelmed pulse vessel and blood swelling near a gross on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give swine injections with vaccines at a swine consumption on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He said he had traveled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that a door to the grizzly was open.
He said there was a large herd of blood in his mouth.
A legal study confirmed that 250 kg of pigs had invited the farmer to die, according to the report.
"My grandfather's leg was bloody and wounded," said the grandfather, who went under the surname "Wu," in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed Yuan entered the market at 4 p.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked off to prevent it from attacking others while police collecting evidence at the site of the crime.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities negotiate compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rareness, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 295 pounds of pig masted a Welsh farmer against his tractor, entering his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just sick.
The jokes, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa is expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwest U.S.
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker, as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will give strong rains with floods in northern Mexico and southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had won 38 m/s, a category 1-orca, at 10 p.m. Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low-pressure running over the Pacific that moves eastwards to the U.S. western coast. As Rosa approaches Baja California Peninsula Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture northwards into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture will then interact with the low-pressure jumper coming closer and create a strong rainfall in the southwest U.S. over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storms, liquid falls and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
The tropical moisture will generate up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain up to 51 to 101 mm in parts of the southwest U.S., particularly over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out of the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Powerful rain can transform clusters into bulbs and the storm will create powerful local winds and create dust blow.</seg>
The low-pressure jumper that approaches will give strong rain along the coast in parts of Southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which can cause smaller amounts of liquid falls and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be large temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes cooler, but it remains fairly warm in the tropicals.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures over 26 degrees from the southern deletions to parts of the northeastern regions.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate view indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million see the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million witnesses on Thursday came from the nominated high court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault, allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that broke down the common programs to tell about Friday’s late development: an agreement made by Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona, which allowed the FBI to conduct a long week investigation of the prosecutors.
Ford told the Senate's judgement committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh in a drunk state grew on her and tried to take her clothes off to a high school feast.
Kavanaugh said in an emotionally-leased statement that he was 100% confident that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million people saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average seertals on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate seer numbers available from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with measuring how many programs are watching at offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a seer number that corresponds to a game under the NFL playoffs or Oscar Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly overlooked the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the consultation.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of moderate Republicans sent a statement that he wanted to vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while protesters shouted to him when he tried to take a lift to the hearing in the judge's committee.
He looked down for several minutes while he was kicked out, and CNN sent live.
“I’m right in front of you,” said a woman.
"Do you think he tells the truth to the country?"
He learned, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had sent a statement, and said before the elevator closed, he wanted to say more at the hearing of the committee.
All TV stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judgement Committee had to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would move to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote for the conviction that the FBI would investigate the prosecutors against the nominated next week, which the Democrats, who are under the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's election had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into prosecutors against Kavanaugh.
Britain’s Prime Minister accuses critics of “legal politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the newspaper’s front page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Brexit Chequers plan and said a proposal to collect each other’s tariffs was “all through ridiculous.”
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of standing behind LSU player’s death
Police arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for alleged murder, police said in Baton Rouge.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost their glasses during the match.
The police found the glasses at the site of the offence and said they found Simpson's DNA on, CBS's subsidiary WAFB reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he had admitted the killing of Wayde.
His deposit is set to $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The lawyer in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that the death cause was a wound from a gun shot from the head to the neck.
The police department says a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU athlete leader, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "enthusiasm and hunting for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per last season match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "in shock" about Waydes death.
“That’s the kind of thing you’re always afraid of,” Wade said.
Vulcan spys ashe over Mexico City
Ass, which is spied by the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored space and ruptures over several circuits.
Photos on social media showed thin layer of ashes on cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a earthquake measuring 7.1 on the right scale, the central Mexico crashed in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police meet Catalan separatists before the jubilee for the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators seeking independence met with surgeons in the rate that thousands of participants participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polar vote on riot.
A group of masked separatists kept the surgeons behind, cast with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also battles later on the day when the police used their staves to keep the battles down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Not forgotten, not forgiven", and met Union demonstrators who shouted "Length Live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries occurring during the protests, the local press reported.
The voting remains high in the memorable region a year after the 1st October vote, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electorate connection was low, and those who were opposed to the liberation were boycotted in great style by the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote during violent conflict at votes throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration of the National Police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he would no longer boldly hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy because they had the opportunity to vote, but now we are seated,” he said.
Although they gained a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain the momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved themselves into exile or sitting in detention and await their role in the vote and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There will be more and more tensions,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have waited for his case since last year, reported that he would submit to the European Parliament election next year.
"The opposition as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to get rid of the backing of the democratic values and the underconception we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men are arrested after houses hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry several times.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A bracelet was also fired against the car at a time.
Shooting from Menga gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston overthrew Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 matches as manager for the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot did the difference when Gary Holt's team ran side by side with the Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won off-road in the league this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they're sitting eight points after, next Sunday.
Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In turn, Livingston develops their unpopular strife for six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash inadequacy
Holt's team had to have been a long time before they scored, and their direct game style created major problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitablely hit out of the goal, after he threw into reaching Craig Halkett's cross-heads in front of the goal.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give up problems in death football situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers’ free park, and Livingston exploited an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the building together to Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home defense, and painter Liam Kelly was almost not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos took a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was fired with the feet of Rangers' target Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another Livingston's death football situation.
Continuous deliveries came into the field of Livingston, but were rejected, and two penal park claims – after Halkett’s deal with the replacement Glenn Middleton and one hand-in-hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal efforts and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastic and exceeded the expectations of their rising trip.
Their play style and teams have been almost unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large portion of the honor has to go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Halkett was great and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their fingers throughout the game.
Rangers missed dog inspiration.
They were sometimes really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their endings were missing sharply – only once they got homelessly – and it’s a sharp awakening for Rangers, which is in the middle of the point.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Køln
There were smiles and blue sky on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship with the two NATO members.
There have been disagreements in areas such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Køln to open a new, big mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a population of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a lot of support appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to take the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest, seen as a hero of some German Turks and deceived as an autocratic of others.
Disaster on the road in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with a car
A bicycler died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, and there were rescues on the ground, but the man died on the ground.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car driving escapes from the site, at Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday’s accident.
Metropolitan Police said the police were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Road stops have been set up, bus routes have been laid up, and drivers are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six police officers injured during anxiety
Six prison officers were injured during anxiety in a high security prison, according to Prison Office.
There was anxiety in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9:30 p.m. Sunday, and the anxiety is still in progress.
Specialized "Tornado" officer has been brought in to deal with the kidneys, which involves eight employees and takes place in a single flight of prison.
Police were treated for smaller face damages on site.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: “Specially trained prisoners are engaged to deal with the ongoing anxiety in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible are being reported to the police and can end up spending longer behind tremors."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 employees, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an employee.
And last October, the officer was called to prison to deal with serious anxiety, where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
The Rosa Hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm flood (dryer areas can drag advantage)
It is rarely that a tropical low pressure affects Arizona, but it is most likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of the hurricane Rosa move over the desert landscape in the southwestern U.S. and creates a risk of storms.
National Weather Service has already issued storm alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out that only "two tropical cyclones had maintained the status of a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km from the border to Arizona.
The latest models from National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will likely get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storms, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because the region is affected by drying.
Flood is a very serious case, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the Southwest U.S. currently experienced dryness.</seg>
According to U.S. drought surveillance, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the next highest category,” weather.com reports.
First, the Rosa hurricane is expected to land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength Sunday morning with a maximum wind strength of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north of 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore drops in strength.
It is therefore expected to be in Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become strong and give a high risk of floods.
"It is expected to rain 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to the northwest Sonora with a possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border to Arizona early Tuesday morning as tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and enter the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very strong rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the U.S. desert area," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storms and liquid falls in the deserts as well as earthquakes in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murder attempts, after a 16-year-old was found with shock in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 p.m. Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police say in Avon and Somerset.
Police have invited everyone who could have mobile recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the Democratic Party's "will and anger"
“A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the democratic party’s unfair and uncertain tactics,” Trump said at a election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been exposed to “the evil, anger” of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh made witnesses before Congress on Thursday and denied Christine Blasey Ford’s severe and emotional accusations that he had committed sexual immorality for her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also issued a statement in the hearing of his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice confirmed by Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skilled legal brains of our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service,” he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking of the importance of the Republican meetings at the mid-term elections.
“In five weeks, it is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can’t vote on me, but you actually vote on me,” he said.
That’s why I’m traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to "oppose and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person highly located in the Republican party told CNN.
Hundreds of dead by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, death rates rise
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were displaced by huge waves that hit the beach when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
Several hundreds of people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at the time of smoking, many sucked into death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunamia emerged after a earthquake measuring 7.5 on the rectangular scale.
"When the tsunamit attack occurred yesterday, people were still running on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian disaster prevention BNPB, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, the busy cars, wooden stains, houses that hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before the coast hit.
More people managed to survive by climbing into trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The catastrophe equipment has published air photographs showing many destroyed buildings and stores, deserted and combined bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterwards continued to crash the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be seen in an area of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Board for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the Board of Directors said.
Nugroho described the injuries as "complete" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were collapsed together.
The equals of a number of victims were found tightened under the wall brokers from collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been damaged, and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and injuries could be bigger along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, closer to the epiccentre of the earthquake.
The communication "because of information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people here," Red Cross said in a statement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” they said.
The government was criticized by many fronts on Saturday to not report that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately shouts warnings about the tsuami coming closer to people in the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water from the coast is struck, carrying buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge power failure that disrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send shipping aircraft with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but there is still a hard need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city’s airport has been reopened, but only for help, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death of Indonesian tsunami smokes over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come to Palu city, where employees are looking for luxury under pressures set in the courtyard at their account. They have gone through areas with extensive destruction on the road, Doseba said.
"They told him that they had so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organizations began the difficult task of re-installing the aid work, complaints were made that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and employees from abroad must enter only if the area where the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, it's a national disaster, we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family kept the missing people firm in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that shine the distant stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a cloak.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been arrested under brokers for two days with her mother's body next to herself.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding country team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings of Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were arrested at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told him how in the hours, after the news about the coordination of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he desperately had sent WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one grey flueben instead of two blue.
“I think that means that the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Tyve takes $26,750 while filling cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was running a cash machine in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car’s driver had emptyed the cash machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, criminal assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran “behind the Brink’s employee” and stole a bag that had been delivered.
According to the press release, more suspects escaped from the site, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All who have information about the thief's identity, please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed its name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: "The substance formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the name Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the songs Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is a shortening of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used words in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m you, I’m you.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the binding track is included.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has never promised to use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody compensation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot against a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-oriented student movements struck many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state subsidies to students and opening several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people into criminal bands.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend in field research, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, according to various parts of the U.S. government have made statements on artificial intelligence, but the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within the AI,” Lee said.
Duplication of the budget could double the chances of the next major performance in artificial intelligence achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google’s department in China.
Lee recognized former technological competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, asking when a new competition comes to identify the next visionary.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get bonders from the government, Lee says.
“It’s not China that triggers the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in artificial intelligence should have automatically offered work permits.
China’s Government Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a manner that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a common center for artificial intelligence, which should involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, U.S. legislation, which is trying to establish a national security committee for artificial intelligence, has been silent for several months.
Macedonians vote on change in the country's name
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's efforts to achieve EU and NATO membership.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a requirement for Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought to join NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the main Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts on whether the voters will represent the 50 per cent required to remain valid.
The question on the vote was, "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying for creating access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so they could live freely under the EU's paraply because it means more safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but many Members of Parliament have said they will comply with the vote result and make it applicable.
The amendment would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no irregularities were reported at 13 p.m.
However, the election was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent at the last 2016 parliamentary election, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the Macedonian vote on a change in the country's name, which would open for NATO and EU membership, in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the tent set by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with rising panda, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide a strongly necessary investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think a large majority will vote for because more than 80 percent of our citizens enter the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a "yes" result would be a "security of our future."
A statement published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote – less than the required election participation.
Another opinion measurement made by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the testing government since it entered in May last year.
See: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense at Manchester City's 2-0-seat on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the middle track at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran quickly over three Brighton defenders before he drove out of the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green trays.
He fought over one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right-wing boots to overwhelm Brighton target Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
“Aguero struggles with some problems with the feet,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him to play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate precedent in the Premier League match.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence the ball deep inside the territory of Brighton.
He sent a nice delivery along the left side to Leroy Sane.
True, he took a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the most remote pillars.
The Sky Blues forward scored the ball on the net just before it glanted over the goals.
City fights against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will drille Rockies
Nationals were eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the castle Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility to participate in playoffs for Rockies, who have played a game more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least fixed in a wild card place with a 5-2-seat over National Friday evening, but still has their first division title for good.
“Although we don’t have anything to play for, we can go to the battle well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest level that I’ll face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play under those circumstances?”
Nationals has not yet announced the launch setting for Sunday, but is likely to put Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the board for the 34th time, trained his cast on Tuesday and would pitche on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The Washington right-hand player is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds elections in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation around his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the Republican meetings at the mid-term elections.
“All that we have done is in play in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big – you can’t vote on me, but you actually vote on me. That’s why I’m traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see that’s happening right now.
And they are determined to get the power back with all available resources, you can see how evil they are, how contradictory they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they're going to run to get power and control; it's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them it."
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "controversing and blocking".
“And you have seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “peaceful and evil, and contradictory and liars.”
He referred to the Supreme Democratic Senator in the Senate’s Judgement Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which led to a loud voice from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you hide the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, wait, it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their attitudes.
Since Momentums activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am only the latest in a number of Labour parliamentarians who have learned that we are not welcome – only because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong distance from anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship went out to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, with regard to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems in which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In most of my eight years as a local parliamentary, the meetings on Friday night have been just that.
Today, the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not the same, and the promise of "friendlyer, brighter" policy is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that deviating views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed on whether the party’s leadership can accept them.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, with whom I had previously believed that I shared political position, began to expect I would make a U-wedging and take attitudes that I would otherwise never have agreed to—whether it is about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – I follow a long string of grudging messages on social media that urge the disloyalty and contradiction of the mid-seek policy and tell me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are generally political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the fighting will of the colleagues who are overwhelmed every day with sexism or racism, but still fights further.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
However, in reality, it is no longer a spacious organization and with every misconception or change of election rules the party becomes narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay on myself and not so high, then I will "not be able to do it".
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government’s forgottenness that had left our classroom in a fair condition, and I set myself to provide better public services to those who need it most – whether it was as a council member or minister in the government.
I have never hid my politics, nor in the last election.
Nobody in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who submit the resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country moves towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's leader.
But one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of the Labour or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no kind of threats to default or political appropriation will prevent me from acting on the basis of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unveiled Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have gained the final result of drawing a not completely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertainment match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the point table and are the only unpopular team of ten.
Finally, it was as high as their superior defence as their better exploitation of chances that brought home home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still unattended, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they exploited their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful spark from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scotland's team player Rory Hughes, awarded to the game by Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed by a spark.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty park just before the halfway, he scored and then got a solo score, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the pause.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a spark from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
Then there was a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out from the track on the bars. When the game was restarted, Ayr expanded the spring with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up spark from Climo.
Functioning Ayr manager Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again exploited their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up spark after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the upcoming Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a spark within the pillars and followed up with a more almost just after the game was restarted, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flying player Gregor Henry to go to the home track's fifth score.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to take the step towards the restaurant industry, after it emerged that he has taken the headquarters of an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character along with his partner Greg Hemphill.
Duoen has announced that the next nine season will be the end of the series, and that Kiernan will plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"Sea is ours": The national state of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Navals patrol around the fleet’s headquarters, in rainfall, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a blue sea flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overcolored with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It is a duty to take it back."
Throughout the national state of Bolivia, a coastal stretch that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict on resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the longevity of sailing in the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia expects a judgment from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and, of course, is waiting for a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will support Bolivia in the fact that Chile, after decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate on giving Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial election struggle next year, also has much to play at the decision on Monday.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take the Bolivian party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, headquartered in the Netherlands, has no power to overcome the territory of Chile and has stipuled that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court rejects the judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given refunds.
"The issue of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales’ war rhetoric has done this with the remaining Chilean welfare, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive “a extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “find a 139-year era of disagreements and gain benefits for both parties,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, which is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crisis.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
“Judging is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear equipment unless they can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never decompose their nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington first.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises made during a Singapore summit between the rival leaders.
His comments were extended that U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to face a restart of the firm nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it is a "will stream" to continue sanctions and the US resistance to a declaration ending the Korean war, which will ever bring North Korea to the knees.
Washington is restrained against the declaration, as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps against disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a further summit.
But there is widespread skepticism in relation to whether Pyongyang is serious in relation to the removal of an arsenal, which the country most likely regards as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month as a preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with big main clothes that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk slide for a collection of remarkable headwear in extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed by Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpleasant hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
The most impressive work of Valentino was an overwhelming with a remote wide shade covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including water melons with jewelry and even an ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks – just at the time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had composite lips that more reminded of Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One creation resembled diving grey with snorkel and mask, and the other resembled a melted vaffelis.
And if you continue the great fashionstatements, you are lucky.
Stylists predict that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The fighters arrive in the hills of "La Bomba", the street hat with a 60 centimeter wide shade, seen all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark, which is behind the most unpractice hat spread across social media, has sent a new large creation down to the catwalk – a beach bag that is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange basket with bastards and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in common shops next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in battle size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic results behind it, and it remains in 2018 with a number of other exceptional examination results, which above the purchase is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other local efforts.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools strive, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), after providing the best service level to their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can compile and implement a customized curriculum, we experience that modern language remains a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it touches the heart.”
It is an important reminder that we can not only stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see the latest examination results this year that language is at the highest level in statistics with most undertaken exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the high character A.
The data collected by SCIS’s 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages are now perceived as a topical choice at the same level as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools think and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons why employers were unable to occupy vacancies had a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Several job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a predecessor to the competitors.
According to a YouGov measurement of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children can find a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to achieve success regardless of what the future offers.
Currently, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this exception to Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets a debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James playing his first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James was playing in the Sunday's opening match before the start of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it’s not clear how many minutes he plays.
“It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is most likely not going to play the entire game.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers’ planned six matches before the season start.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t need to fight before the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a string of election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first out of five planned election meetings next week, including Trump’s meetings in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump’s appointed judges to the free seat at the Supreme Court is set in burden, Trump is trying to make up for the upcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over Congress when the votes are issued in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish time) at night between Saturday, November 29th and Sunday, November 30th, 2018.
You can see Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is most likely to talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were charged with sexually offensive behaviour, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation was put in charge for a week while the FBI investigates the prosecutors.
However, the primary goal of this band is to create a momentum for the Republicans faced with a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five next week’s election meetings aim to “create energy among volunteers and support when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control over the Congress is as important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign time,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be cited by name, told Reuters.
This evening's election meeting will be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump's supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month, Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the opinions.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to get up to give him a boost in the opinions,” said Simon Haeder, who is engaged in state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team U.S. has demonstrated fighting and attempts to keep hope alive before Sunday’s single duels
After three unilateral turns on Saturday, the four-man duels might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The vibrant momentum pendul is a completely invented sport concept, but a concept that players believe – notably in competitions like this.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They took six points, and now it's four, so we think it's a little bit like a moment," Jordan Spieth said before he held the fourth night.
Of course, Europe has the advantage. They are 4 points in front, and there are 12 more points to play about.
However, as Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in the ships, and there are lots of encouraging things to focus on, especially the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and puts a good example for his teammates.
The high jubilee shouts became higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put, which secured victory in four duels, even though he and Thomas had been two hits behind two duels.
His put, which secured them the match on the hole 15, was encountered with a similar screaming — the kind of screaming that he does not think the American team is out of competition yet.
“You just need to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own fight,” Spieth said.
That's all the players have now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable but sympathetic couples have scored four points in four matches, and it appears error-free.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy appears to flow from and from the wild audience show that it is the most difficult to strike on Sunday, and it would certainly be very popular if a potential European victory is tied up by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun rises over Le Golf National.
Anything's synchronous on each of their holes.
It is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial against Sergio Garcia, in the morning in the four-man duels, when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole that they were never near to get out.
Sunday no one can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look closely at teams due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can quickly change.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-person duels have also shown that the Team USA has played the battle that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates 10-6 leads for the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the U.S. at 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two defeats over a difficult Tiger Woods and have achieved four points at Le Golf National until now.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the cup they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inappropriate American team in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The United States made more resistance in foursomes. They won four matches, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the championship.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in turn, and he and Molinari, together having received the name "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second couple in Ryder Cup's history to win four points in their first four matches.
The ruined Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated an unforgettable Woods and American debut Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought for the first two matches on Saturday, had little genial glimpse, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in trails.
Justin Rose was well-developed in the morning fourballs and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and won a 2-1 series over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it as they want it, on a slightly flooding day southwest of Paris.
Three-fold major-winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard 2-1-seat over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind four points before the single matches, but since Furyks currently has the championship, they only have to achieve indefinitely to maintain it.
After having been the second best in two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a moden attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will not be unilaterally decomposed if there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that further sanctions reinforce their inconfidence to the United States and that the country will not abandon their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s General Assembly that North Korea had demonstrated “significant welfare” in the last year, e.g. by stopping nuclear and missile tests, deviating an area of nuclear tests and laws not to further develop nuclear weapons and technology.
“We haven’t seen any similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first steps and disrupt unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-shaped" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took step by step, but his speech seemed important as it did not clearly reject unilateral disarmament, as it had previously been from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work "nuclear equipment on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal ending of the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang should first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to bleeding for sharp international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear equipment first’ and develops the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by forced and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” said Ri.
“The idea that the sanctions can bring us into the knees is a desired dream among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our misconfidence.”
Ri did not mention plans for a further summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader highlighted earlier this week by the United Nations.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If nuclear equipment were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so closed."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris’ speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the fire of North Korea’s missiles against the U.S. continent was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened "total destruction" of North Korea in the United Nations, but this year he cried out against Kim in relation to disarmament, but said there is still much to be done and that the sanctions must remain until North Korea disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a schedule for these actions, but he said, “It doesn’t matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with persuasion and without mistake until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline during the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said there had been progress, while North Korea just after a few hours accused him of imposing "continuous demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "equivalent steps" he demanded were the security lifts that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against a normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counter the growing macho culture, where you study all night held up large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world’s best universities often don’t recognize the first thing to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after holding an appointment about the effects of sleep deficiency on learning.
"When the recording was finished, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why do I get this first to know now when I am on the candidate?'
"She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve both academic and sports performance and even overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep deficiency during the week.
The time-long course consists, among other things, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is an image of a college room where students should click on coffee cups, gardins, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how even sports performance is influenced by a lack of sleep, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how sleep deficiency over a long time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood strokes, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map over the campus.
“We know that it won’t change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Czeisler added.
The pride in taking a "allnight" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to a growing problem of sleep shortages.
The “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep,” he said – it even counters weight gain because sleep deficiency makes the brain believe that they are hungry, because they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology last year, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students put an alarm so that they know when to sleep and when to wake up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can turn back by the daily rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the outside when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's unconsistent team had to take gratitude with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox was defeated after their first off-road victory since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team couldn't respond back.
Rangers now smoke down on a sixth place, while Livingston clings up on a third place after the Hibernian with only the target corn for difference.
And there could have been several bad news on the way to Rangers, since Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a thrown object that seemed to come from the outer section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the setting that reached Betfed Cup semi-final by toning through Ayr.
On the contrary, Holt set up with the same 11 who barbed a point of Hearts’ introduction last week, and he would have been happy to see his sharp team exhausting opponents throughout the course.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the match, when Menga's first release sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempts were over.
A freezer park in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found the way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence player Alan Lithgow jumped through the rear tower.
Rangers took control, however, but played more in hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was at least not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson underwent Columbus' appeals to criminal park when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a quarter of a game.
Rangers had only two shots at goals in the first half, but former Rangers defender Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejarias dam shot.
Although Livis's opening in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to have been worthy of their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a death ball situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily shoot it in goal.
In the pause, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave poet when the flyer sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls up on the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's mind could have expanded the leadership in the last part of the match, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton recalled for a late penalty park after being dried together with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the second way here.
Annual book: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the yearbook “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would lead to the apparatus known as the Geiger Counter.
The geiger counter has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the main roles as Bondian scientists:
Man: "What is it in the world?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger count that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that radiation activity in the minerals does."
Evans: "Wait, now it's going on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he had been 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccines can teach immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein that is common for many cancer forms, and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of cancer forms.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancer forms have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "have several forms of cancer to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells are taken out of patients and "learn" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't work well.
After an inconsistent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was defeated when he honored U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he himself would set up as president candidate in 2020.
When he played the night's third song Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again wardrobe, he began a dunder talk against the Democrats and held his support for Trump.
“I’m talking so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
But if I were worried about racism, I would have moved too long from the United States,” he said.
SNL started the show tonight with a sketch with Matt Damon, where Hollywood star laughed with Brett Kavanaugh's witness statement in the Senate's court committee on Christine Blasey Ford's offensive charges.
Although the recordings were not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirade on social media.
It's unsure if Rock tried to exhibit West by putting up the recordings.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage due to its main clothing.
"They mobbed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go there with that hatred."
They mocked me!
And they said I was deeply sucked," he said in Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you see how deep I am?", and said he would take his Superman cap because that means, "You can't decide what I'm going to do. Would you like progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience shared at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff left to be ridiculous, explains Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was bombed in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received an appointment from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the braveest people: Thanks for not laying you out of the question."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and it's totally fine."
"But I don't choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his "art"), which includes and exerts an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's promised.
And that’s what we have,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced that he had taken a name change to the "entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap colleague Snoop Dogg has called Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs out after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swiping swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor goes long after the stereotypical macho hero and says that this kind of TV character means that young men often feel tough to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he thought there was "something wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, admitted that the problem was "most in mind".
“For the moment, I’m a lot in mind – where are we going wrong in the city with masculinity?”
“If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have taught young men in their growing up?”
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very male characters.
He said, “What is the newborn and what is taught?
What do young men learn from television and on the streets that make them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something wrong has happened to the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make followers to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said he is "competent with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit participates in a fire play by Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is thief.
The actress recently revealed that he considers having met his wife Rose as the best of all the Game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so in this way it has given me my coming family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with the Emmy Award winning fantasy.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslies family’s homeland in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health authorities say.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
A long majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to somewhat close to zero, Chinese health authorities say at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997 homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is a common phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women earlier or later due to their conservative values.
Many infectious cases are due to the lack of contraception in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to leak staff data on Republican senators and tords against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
A member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the charges that a member of her crew shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the claims came from websites and supported from "the outer right-wing".
"Lies, lies, and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The information published contained allegedly home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was published on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill on the internet during a Senate hearing on sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
It happened after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information was posted by Waters’ people, after which they published information about a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill wrote.
"This unreasonable charge is totally unfair and a direct lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false charges is in no way liable for this leak of information.
This unreasonable accusation is totally unfair and a direct lie."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, among other things from former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of the Congress.
If you are accused of something you haven't done, you shouldn't be angry.
You shouldn't be sad.
You should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You need to keep your minds safe.”
Fleischer made Waters’ reaction compare to the Democratic criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday’s consultation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take Waters' position in the midterm election, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she said that her crew has contacted "the relevant authorities and order powers regarding these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the criminals are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my crew."
Review by Johnny English again – Understanding Spy Comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent British films with an ice cream, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the country's new export possibility be dried, sarcastic self-sacrificing, as much as it depends on us?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has received his permission to make brochures again and again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic invention directed against places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
Of course, he is the dumb secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife spider Mr. Bean, and properly climbed by him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He was also originally based on the world-wide and international bubble that left chaos in his refrigerator, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television ads.
There are some good moments in this latest shooting on the tribe of JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval army, and the propells sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson’s talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite subtle and strange overflowing, especially now as more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be focused on children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's smugglers in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current point for the film is that the UK is in serious knife.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field of horror for the responsible agent – an unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and fighting Prime Minister who has already suffered a complete distortion of political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been disclosed, she has to cancel someone’s retirement.
And of course, it is the crazy Johnny English, who is now a super-class school inspector, but who secretly teaches in how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequence here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock training in spying.
English has hurryed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and re-united with its hard-tested former right hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an over-enthusiastic but well-known submarine captain – a role on which Vicki Pepperdine was played.
Thus, the royal intelligence service Batman and Robin are completely amazed when they meet Olga Kurylenko beautiful woman fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is swinging close to interfering with the charismatic and alarming tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough starts their angry, risk-rich escapades: Forwarded as servants put them in fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Voltas luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Voltas house.
All the cannons are deprived of the film's final sequence, but no matter how well and energetic it is, there is a sense of childhood view over it.
Just medium-sized.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking with the other Johnny English film: Can the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to bars for four-day work week with unchanged salary to the British
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can be careful with a four-day working week, but get wages for five.
The party will allegedly have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an additional holiday.
This would mean that employees would have three days of weekends without going down the wage.
Sources argue that the idea would coincide with the party's economic goals of drawing the country in a more favorable direction for workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
“It won’t happen on a day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party’s approach to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the party’s overall industry strategy.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously in the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not the party’s policy and is not under consideration in the party.”
Labour’s Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell spent last week’s party meeting recording his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to withdraw power from "anonymous directors" and "exploitants" in supply companies.
The Shadow Finance Minister’s plans also suspicions whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, as a Labour government in the top could “maturity” them on the grounds of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to obtain employees in corporate boards and to establish including ownership funds to share 10 per cent of private corporate share value to employees to receive up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh issued the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and this raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview showing on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could grave something that could make them change their position.
Kennedy made it more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
"When I entered the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called to him after this happened – after the accusations came up – and said, “Did you do that?”
He was steely, determined and unclear.”
Graham's voice, on the contrary, seems to be stuck in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and another would require a very violent charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it to the most powerful," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
This happened 36 years ago.
I can't see that it's going to change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will receive for the seventh time tens of thousands of people at Central Park’s great films, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will bring attention to the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international organization of interest that struggles to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you don’t want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful action that can raise attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years back to reach the goal?
Does it create the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called “click activism” – i.e. that people feel that they do a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million "acts" from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding goals and political actions, equivalent to more than $37 billion, which is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had become due to their actions, which amounted to more than $10 billion that had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been launched in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong trade people. They strive to "help children to survive their full potential" and promise $35 million to address nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with undernutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” said the ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that the Government of England has now promised resources to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutritional advice.
As a response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: “It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will snuggle and make mistakes.
But as with the movement of civil rights and the movements against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performances of this year's New York festival. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are hosts.
U.S. may use its fleet to "blocker" for Russian energy sports, the U.S. Interior Minister said.
“If necessary,” Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from getting into the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke reveals to Washington Examiners.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s intervention in Syria – particularly where they operate on invitation from the legal government – is an incentive to expand the sales of their energy.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy as they do in East and South Europe,” he said.
According to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“The U.S. has the opportunity with our fleet to ensure that there is free passage on the sea roads, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we can ensure that their energy does not come into the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization that regards itself as “the voice of the U.S. energy consumers”.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are at the bottom and at the bottom.
"The economic possibilities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements follow that the Trump administration has aimed at increasing the European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have attempted to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s strong resistance to the project is an expression of disproportionate competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I believe we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is faced by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed their participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, BDI, has asked the United States to mix itself outside of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with the involvement of a third party in our energy supply,” said BDI leader Dieter Kempf after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks strongly" to put up with the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Senator said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts "considers strongly" to put up to the presidential election after mid-term elections," she said on Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering quiet.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front,” she said.
“After November 6, I will consider considering the presidential election.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump to know during the council and said that he "brings the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been pronounced in his criticism by Trump and his High Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, Warren wrote: “Of course, the FBI must investigate the case before the vote.”
However, a statement from Thursday shows that the majority of Warren’s own country does not believe that she should resign in 2020.
According to a statement from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidate.
The measurement showed a greater upgrading to former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% against a possible upgrading.
Other high-profile democratic candidates, discussed in the 2020 presidential election, count among others the former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he announced his final decision in January, Associated Press wrote.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a Donald Trump Election Meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with violence at home on Monday night.
“What my own son is experiencing after he comes home makes me link to other families that mark the consequences of PTSD and other injuries our soldiers return home with,” she told the audience at a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think of whether there is respect for it, their colleagues on land and in the air, and all the other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman to prevent the reporting of domestic violence and to be in possession of a drunk weapon, says Dan Bennet, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support resistance to new asylum law
18 states and District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that refuses asylum to victims fleeing band violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-dependent statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who opposes the law, according to NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against the federal law in August, has not been published.
She stated that her partner "and his violent sons who are band members" had abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come from countries with widespread problems with bands and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum legislation endorsed a decision made by the U.S. Foreign Relationship in 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia State Attorney, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "was away from decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against the principle," the party-dependent statement states.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on refusal of immigrants would harm the U.S. economy, as it is more likely that they become independent and "provide the necessary labour force."
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions dismissed immigration judges the right to give asylum to victims who fled from domestic violence and band violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
It has never been meant that asylum should solve all problems – or just all serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the number of deaths doubles, the attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation was only worse.
"It's very stressful," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her little boy with fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance comes in with the body.
We don't need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their devastated homes to sort into translated property and to save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and hospitals also affected by a 7.5 earthquake could not accompany.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, lay outside Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outside due to severe abnormalities.
He got tears in his eyes when he told him how the violent earthquake broke the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
“I was amazed at a ruined wall,” Haris said to Associated Press, adding that his family would go to a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife crying out for help, but then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of infinite methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page announcement in an American newspaper that hits the benefits of an American-China cooperation, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China’s paid intrusion in the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in the November 6th Congress election.
U.S. officials say that Trump’s accusation of Chinese involvement in the US election marks a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now closed in an escalating trade war, where they have put duties on each other’s import goods.
China’s debt duty in the trade war would affect exporters in states like Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican party, believe Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China, former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday leader in the Des Moines Register that China "opposes the use of the infinite methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"With spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud U.S. tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the kiosks here in Beijing you will find only a few disagreements, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes towards China's worrying economic direction as the media are under close control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans foreign women before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a contradiction in the upcoming mid-term elections, especially women.
The case has put the emotions in culinary, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process to continue.
"This can't be done about it," Grant Reher, professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) would request an 11-hour FBI survey to give light anger to voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they don’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, according to The Hill on Friday.
Friday morning, the protesters shouted during a Senate demonstration: "November comes!" when the Republicans who control the legal committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
"People say that it has already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, particularly among women in the predecessors and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, even though they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford's public allegations of the Supreme Court's sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could give backwards if the Republicans continued the nomination.
"It has become a worse root for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote or the final result of the committee, or whether Kavanaugh is liable, but it's also about how the Republicans have handled it here and how they have treated it," says Guy Cecil, president of Priorities U.S., a group supporting Democrats to be elected to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared attitudes to whom they should believe after the statements made by Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new opinion by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford’s witness statement, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was either likely or certainly lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a call from Flake, the FBI now investigates the charges made by Ford and at least another, Deborah Ramirez wrote for The Guardian.
Ford said last week under oath to the Senate's court committee that Kavanaugh was fully engaged in her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the nominated Supreme Court showed her gender parts to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is Inrupt and is a company based on the Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee laughed that the plan with Inrupt is "world rule".
"We'll have to do that now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology so people can create their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique in the collection of personal data online is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to collect resources, processes and ability to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralized apps using the available tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether they're going to change everything completely, so all their business models suddenly become overwhelming."
"We don't ask for your permission."
In a Saturday media statement, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the so-called network neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next period of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Guest recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I
The only priest of the English church who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during the First World War will be celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant and priest Bernard Wann won the orders on September 29, 1918, during the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, one of his two grandchildren was revealed at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly winning business.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his Battle of Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "with a very thick train and under heavy protection from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran up to the front line and led his people with the "largest man's opposition" before he alone attacked an artillery-riding and harmless three cannons.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother James Vann also set a crane after the parade, which was directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “he felt very proud of participating in the parade” and added that “the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism.”

Imagine that you’ve been upstairs all night to see the starlight Bellator 206 and then you’ll be denied to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the viewers in England became somewhat surprised as the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were impressed after they had stayed awake early in the morning for this match.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a child cartoon film as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6am in the morning, why they had to switch to children's programs," Bellator's senior vice president Dave Schwartz said when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Grisen Gurli, yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they would work to include English spectators in the planning future.
“When you think about the re-emission, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six Sunday morning there, and we don’t find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when I was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the legislation.
I promise you that this will not happen next time.
We got five matches instead of six, as usual, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had “minder value” over sexuality
Tom Daley says that he felt less worthy than any other in his growth due to his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it didn't go up for him before he came to the larger classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said he went less to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host of the long-running radio program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said he felt "minder worth" than everyone else in his growing up because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, “From today, the feelings of feeling worthy of memory and feeling differently have been the things that have given me strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality to know.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for the decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told him that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar up and down tours when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that “his whole perspective” had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would all work if I had to win a gold medal," he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told him that his father did not accept him to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had received tickets to London in 2012 – when he would sit in front of him.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breath stopped, and it first came up for me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – that had meant much during the opposition to the Olympics and still gave him gaze skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bank to Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson records on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he's going to do something in the form if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who records for the 12th time to join the competition, which takes place every 2 years, was placed on the bank of Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the events for the United States as usual, the five-double grand winners had to exercise their game in the hope of correcting the swips.
Even at the highest point of his career, he had the most fair drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the Le Golf National, where the long rough often punished wildfire.
And if the race wasn't big enough, Mickelson will meet at the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate British Open Francesco Molinari winner, who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 single matches start strongly, Mickelson’s match can be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprised confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a hit on his back, laid his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I imagined he should play more, but that's how he did, and that's how he should be.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldo records for most matches played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to measure its individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven undeterminate, although Furyk said that his presence contributes to something indefinite.
"He's funny, sarcastic, ridiculous, he likes to go to people, and he's good to have in the team," he explained.
“I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes with much more than just the game.”
Europe’s Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that big lead can quickly disappear
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows with experience that a solid drive before the last day of Ryder Cup’s single can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point forehead over the Americans, but was just about to be captured before the target race with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2
“You will remember yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just just won,” Bjørn said after seeing the 2018 team won 5-3 Friday and at a total lead at 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it’s not over.
It's gonna have a full screw tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it’s to try to win the trophy, and that’s where our focus is.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other hand – the best golfers in the world.”
Enjoying his players’ performance on a tough track, Bearn added: “I don’t take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual performance that counts, and it is something completely different.
It’s amazing to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you’re out alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – get the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he will also get the best in himself.”
It looks different for opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has even experienced matches on the last day. Only on the Brookline win team before he lost when Europe made "The Miracle on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once the momentum has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the mid-match.
We compile our team in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task to try to lead the retreat and face Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans are playing in the first half of the series.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it secures us all the way,” Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship is re-discharged
The German fleet's latest freight had been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but the Germans have to wait at least a year further due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media write.
The insertion of the largest ship in the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fregattens, "Rheinland-Pfalz", is deducted to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The ship should have been part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have impaired the ambitious project.
The four vessels from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aged fregates from the Bremen class.
If you know they will have a powerful canon, a wide range of anti-air shooting and anti-navy missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest fregates is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the fregates away from the home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays means that the advanced warships – which, according to them, will make Germany appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are imposed, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 fregat created titles last year, when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss store in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the ship builder after delivery.
We did not know much about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance as ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were to be controlled by a 120-season board – it is only half of the board from the older Bremen boards.
It also proved that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the possibility of future updates.
The 7,000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes training in mind, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached decaying €3.1 billion (3.6 billion), with an original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet is screwing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chief of the German Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "leaves dry for clear ships."
The officer said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the Fregate from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust listens to the Secret Life of the Flagmouse
New research from an area in the Scottish Highland is trying to reveal how flag mouse uses the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shine light on the unique, flying pet behaviour and help in working with future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scholars from Scotland’s National Trust and follows common flag mice, sweater mice, long-lasting flag mice and water mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the flag mouse throughout the season.
Data from staff from NTS and volunteers are also collected using manual detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of flag muscles and show what kind of thing is doing.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are drawn up.
NTS’s Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal what areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat-conserving efforts, such as the establishment of bees, and how to best preserve forest areas for flag mice and similar species.
The number of flag mice in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the redners and restrict their habitat.
Wind moulding and lighting may also pose a danger. The same can be flue pairs, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
Flagermus isn't blind.
But because they are primarily hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced ecolocation technology to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes flag mushrooms very seriously.
They have ten trained experts, who often collect data, inspect reeds and sometimes make rescue actions.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated flag mushroom reserve at the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten Scotland’s flag mushroom species.
Retail dealer David Thompson says that it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a very good area for flag mouse," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot of people who don’t know about flags, so working here and elsewhere can help understand what they need to prosper.”
He emphasizes the importance of looking for flag mice before performing maintenance tasks on property, as the destruction of a single reason can kill up to 400 girls and children, thereby risking the destruction of a whole local population.
Flagermus is peace, and it is illegal to kill, gender or disturb them or their punishments.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to give a hand with.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mouse, and too many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations evolve."
Ronaldo refuses prosecution of rape while lawyers claim German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called a prosecution against him for "fake news" and says people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to appeal to the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he has paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information to be "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-doble winner of Ballon d'Or told the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man, and everything’s fine,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to appeal Der Spiegel due to the prosecutors, which they have called, according to Reuters, “a unforgiving publication of suspicions about the privacy sphere.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral destruction in a class equivalent to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event took place in June 2009 at a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he must have raped her anal, according to the report presented in the Clark County court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good man 99% of time" caught by "one percent."
The case papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photographed her injuries at a hospital, but that she later joined a deal outside the court because she felt "anxiety for compensation" and worried about being "publicly dismissed".
The 34-year-old now says she is going to circumvent the deal as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was facing a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event had to take place, and this summer moved to the Italian Juventus Grand Club for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
The UK "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit," said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "beautiful" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I can see, production will stop at our factory if Britain smokes out of the EU at the end of March," Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke said.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are afraid to leave the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main examination of the car manufacturers is related to the risks of the supply chain in the event of a withdrawal without agreement.
Toyota’s production runs on a narrow schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day of production at the Derbyshire factory, and then the production would be stopped, the company said.
According to Clark, Theresa Mays Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "consolidated, so that these supervisions are precisely avoided at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We will have the best deal, which not only allows us - as I call it - to enjoy our current success, but to interfere with this option," he said in a BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The opinions from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we have to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce factory competitiveness, which will eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come back."
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may “be spent a week more,” as the nominated high court Brett Kavanaugh continues,” the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on his shoulder during his investigation into Russian election intervention, relations between Trump’s assistants and Russia and the possible obstacle to the court.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby risk Mueller’s independence, it has been a slaughter in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissal the president through the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and the noise went out to say he would.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was agreed on Thursday, who was at the time in the United Nations headquarters in New York City.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to release Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the Senate court hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, had to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is no date set, it could be this week. Also I can imagine it could be stuck a week with everything that takes place in the Supreme Court.
But we need to see and I always like to keep the press updated.”
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to TV journalists' game for the gallery, but added: "I don't agree that they play up to the camera."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president takes more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, and added without citing a source, "we've seen the numbers."
“Press meetings will still be held,” Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press conferences with high-quality guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Health Minister contacts EU staff in Scottish healthcare after Brexit notices
The Minister of Health has written to the EU letter working in Scotland’s NHS to express its gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than a year and a half before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continue, and it seems that decisions are expected to be made for the autumn.
But the British government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know that it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts each employee has made regardless of their nationality.
Co-workers from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the healthcare industry’s work for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having a slight head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State first coach, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the pause.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a bar and took him into further study.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type or extent of the damage yet," and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he claims the damage.
Abercrombie is studying for the second year and is initiating its first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five matches on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 matches in total this season.
Foreign buyers pay higher stamp tax when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the conservative party, must help the homeless.
This feature is to push Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to get £120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May today suggests that foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of homeless.
The withdrawal will be considered an attempt to match Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and following them with the highest income.
The increase in stamp tax will affect persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The income from this will be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The expenditure, which is imposed above the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago in multi-home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by foreigners, making prices rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot inside the home market.
Many rich areas of the country, particularly in the capital, have become "spoke cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cutting off stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused major building and plant companies of keeping the real estate prices up by purchasing reasons they do not use. He asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to resolve Britain's "fake housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching number of housing arrangements, including checking for rental prices and removal of the renter's ability to place people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functional housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can’t be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as much as for hardworking British.
For too many, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the indignity of sleeping in the streets is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to become Scotland’s coach”
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimative goal" is at a time to become Scotland's coach.
The Scotch of 42 enjoys the challenge of restoring the North East club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's SportsSound.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland on the Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always dragged me.
However, this would only happen if I have succeeded in training clubs.”
Ross's former coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach said he had no concern about following so established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success from whether I can get this club back in Premier League."
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly home to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’d only want to see myself as a success here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years in his career as a coach after a period of assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coach team.
Then he helped Alloa return after being wrapped down in the third row and transformed St. Mirren from the downturn to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more adapted now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real way of divorce," he remembers the time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought that training was the right thing for me, more correct than being a player.
It sounds weird because I managed it well, earned reasonably and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still the kind of stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I always wanted to train and now I do it. I haven't had it more comfortable with myself all my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 17:30, the study shows
The heat wave this summer has increased income for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
The sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the sales of restaurants decreased by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a corporate consultant at CGA and collected the numbers, said: “Fortshat sunshine and England’s unexpected long world championship have meant that July follows the June patterns where pubbs experienced merchandise of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The decline of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was worse than in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the sale of beverages were clearly the best and experienced progress equivalent to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Within pub and barbecue chains, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, while the food decreased by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, the weather and major social or sports events are the biggest factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still fighting, although a drop in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt the oven's rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only the time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a hard-needed breathing space."
The total increase in sales for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, showing the decline in newly launched brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, who monitors sales figures for English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than £9 billion, and they are leading in the field.
Every five children have a secret social media account they hide from their parents
Every five children – up to 11 years of age – have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 school students in 4-9 class reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is put up
20% of students say they have a "head account" that they can show their parents.
Every five children up to 11 years of age create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from 4th grade reveals violent growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being put up.
20 percent of students said they have a "head account" that they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother who fell over the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, so a teenager who invited others to "rape me".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to have private accounts.
HMC’s leader, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s terrifying that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors for Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those making decisions on sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience internationally.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletic world in Scotland will be able to benefit from getting her to the board of directors," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help out a direction for sports in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, 200 and 400 meters, and who are now a commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transitional icemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I was hit by a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show if I would go up to it and to what extent.
It has been a hard bone work, but I’m very fast, I’ve learned to go again and do agile exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers to cows receive mixed receipt online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows that are milking.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first soundless breast pump, the technology consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume that is full of cheese, to a song in which it blasphemes. "Yes, I'm shaking myself, but you see no cheese" and "If you didn't notice it, it's not over here, it's my breasts."
It sounds like, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I melt my barm."
However, the advertising that has been published on the company’s Facebook page has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes laughter with the "throats" in the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they should become pregnant and nurture before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth,” a user wrote.
The breast pumps from Elvie pass discreetly in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another writer said, “Comprehensiblely traumatic enough for both mother and child.
But yes, why don’t you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another adds: "Drink an insensitive advertising."
Another defended the advertisement. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredible fun."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertising aimed at mothers pumping milk (often at their workplace or toilets) and feels like 'cow'.
It’s not a advertising that rose or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discrete pumps in their bhs.
The concept behind advertising is based on that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely soundless, has no pipes or snakes and fits discreetly in a breast-bh, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a boring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and milk seeds, we would focus on the challenges of breast-feeding, while in a fun and recognizable way we showed the freedom the new pump can give.”
It’s not the first time the Elvie pump has created titles.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children in secret moved to tent camps at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border passengers has not changed. This is due to a harder rhetoric and the Trump administration's sharp laws that make it harder to place children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they are afraid of their ability to stay in the country by getting up and taking a child.
The risk of domestication increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household should give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that they had arrested several people seeking to sponsor unemployed minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had pure penalties.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsor households stay illegal in the country, and a large portion of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people,” Albence said.
In the attempt to deal with children's cases faster, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month after their detention.
Many use video calls instead of themselves to meet and speak their case for legal stay to an immigration judge.
Those who are condemned to unlawful stay will be deported quickly.
The longer children get in stock, the higher they are likely to get anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent exacerbations or refugee attempts, according to assistants and reports that have come from the system over the past few months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on if a child suffers.
They added that moving to a tentland town without mental preparation or the possibility to say goodbye to friends can raise traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish "Occupation Forces" to withdraw immediately
When Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now at its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Vice-President, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the abundance of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with similar funds."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism is "nearly over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "unlawful foreign presence".
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the armed country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough to be able to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spread unreasonable fear" that made the refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are polishing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The U.S. and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey was established to avoid a large attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province of three million residents.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would follow jihadists from the Nusra Front, a group of Al-Qaeda exiles, which "will be deleted".
The UN's mission, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon invite the first meetings of the new committee to replace a post-war constitution for Syria and to move the path of elections, consisting of government and opposition members.
Moualem has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee and insists that the work of the panel should be limited to "to revise the legislation in the present constitution" and warned against intervention.
Trump wins another presidential period
Based on the logic, Trump will probably be re-electioned in 2020, unless the government case and the scandals end his presidential period before time, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what is undoubtedly "the most dramatic ending of a presidential period ever!"
There are currently no signs of victoriousness.
Since 2014, the seer numbers of the best broadcast time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in the evenings with great news.
“It’s a spectacle that people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a cabinet leader who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and writer bag "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other television programs, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be unified and the health of the world economy.
Change channels are only the most privileged ones.
And yet it's about more than being informed citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's string leather jacket for $15,000 ("coated with hybris", The Washington Post) and Trump's implications of Stormy's life.
I never want to see Super Mario in the same way.
“Some of the things that make it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show’s rotating crew and daily surprises (rose with N.F.L.) to Kim Jong-un.

When I captured Fleiss this week, there were 26 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not force himself to leave; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to be heard in the Senate court, and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before in time, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find the way to the nearest midterm election to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a compensation of two "Congressional Districts" two members of Congress are fighting for the same seat.
This newly resettled Pittsburgh municipality creates problems for the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another sitting member of Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which strongly overlaps the new 17.
The cards were made again, after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January condemned that the old district was legally opposed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has begun a fight for financial resources between the Committees of the Great Parties, the Democrats’ Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high surveillance election in March's special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been in the hands of the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a small advantage.
The US planned to punish El Salvador for China’s support, but re-determined
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with a few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump’s leadership team.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry decided to call leading U.S. diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Foreign Ministry in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador, who was punished. They received about $140 million from the US in 2017 for bla.narcotics control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts of financial assistance and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials issued a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from arriving in the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made clear that they would like the conference to take place anyway, thus droping the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will talk to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal about the importance that the Americans put in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. broadcasters returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outstanding analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of an anonymity condition.
Know the history
The next obstacle could well be Robert Mueller's special report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, which is substantial and publicly available evidence.
Accordingly, Mueller will also address his investigation into the question of whether Trump’s campaign has been secretly cooperating with Russia about the attack on the election.
If Congress had to come into new hands, Trump would probably be held responsible while preparing to meet the voters again, and with time, of course, a jury of his comrades.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's final is inevitable – and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must all make decisions that will affect how long the battle will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a state coup against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and did not catch the possibility to avoid the long-term blood bath then.
It is about such turnpoints that the axis of history rotates, and the irrevocable march of democracy rotates.
In the United States, we are facing several of these turnpoints.
What if Trump shoots the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the President and disputed his suitability for the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is unprecised.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not carried out properly - or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, are we going to vote for a congress that will keep Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime itself, which once occupied my embassy's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to open the Sabbath lights on the table with the cross of the garden.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic for the match against SK Rapid Wien
Following the impressive uncertain results in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, with a victory against the Austrians, they will have great opportunities to move from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midway player Graham Dorrans from getting a seasonal debut before the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a jumper for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We went to the fight with faith that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken home, but in total it was a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and was the best team.
On Thursday, there will be another big European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last match, but with the audience behind us I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive now, put the last season behind us and get success.”
Fear of retirement makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants of the study had a solid idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few people talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study said they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they do nothing to start the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them about your wishes in time.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to get care. These choices can be crucial factors for costs.
Ask your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be funded, among other things, by using a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self- insurance with your own funds – as long as you have a economy for it.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal matches in the course.
Get a full power so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical care and make sure that doctors and nurses meet your wishes in case you can’t communicate yourself.
Consider also a financial power.
In this case, you designate a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your invoices are paid if you don’t have the opportunity to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aged parents needs urgent medical care and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you're ready.
“It’s not just a question about the economy – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who fits the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim was in the 1940s and was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, middle floor and hand.
Police describe the shooting, which took place around 02:30, as "hello random."
The victim was not the offender.
His injury is not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reporting to the authorities expecting the number of killings to rise.
As the communication paths are out of play, emergency personnel have not been able to receive information from the Donggala River, a northern area of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379.800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary, when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a rainbow that extends over 300 km of the coastline on the northwest part of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the Regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the Central South Africa economy, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami who killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called fire in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra launched on 26 December a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatras in late March and only in April.
There were hundreds of deaths on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake, measuring 6.8, hit the south of Java, Indonesia's closest populated island, and launched a tsunami that led to the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the west Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake, measuring 7.5, hit one of the Mentawai islands out of Sumatra and unveiled a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake struck Pidie Jaya in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was remembered of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapse buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck Indonesian tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's eldest son aims for violence at home
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Vice-President Candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, obstacle to reporting domestic violence and for opposition to arrest, according to a Saturday report issued by Alaska State Troops.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman known when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is incarcerated in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a deposit of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was filed in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "completely innocent," the network reported.
Palin is targeted for three Class A crimes, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been targeted for a Class B crime, which can lead to a single day jail punishment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been targeted for crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under trial at Alaskas Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic violence, had prevented the reporting of a violent crime at home, as well as arms ownership in an affected state of the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of having hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his dismissal in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island Sulawesi hit.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and released a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communications, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos that show the moment where the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach party in Palu, when the tsunami took off the coast.
Public prosecutors try to get terrorist suspects in NYC condemned rare death sentences
Public prosecutors try to condemn Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people - a rare punishment, last sentenced for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov used a rental car from the Home Depot building market to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came on the road were dropped down.
As the basis of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intensively" killed the eight victims and "intensively" caused serious injuries. This is required by the intentional declaration of death penalty in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these views.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov for a 22-point charge, including eight charges of gangster murders, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "complete planning and preparations," said the prosecutors and described Saipov's execution as "arrogant, wicked and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, physical injury and loss for families and friends by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was a decade ago that New York's southern district was last charged in a death sentence case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to lifetime imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested after being sentenced to death for spies on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no signs of indication in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he stated to the investigators that he was doing well with his deeds.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be hanged up in his hospital room, the officers told.
He has refused to blame the 22 points of the prosecution.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "naturally disappointed" in the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister says Nigel Farage should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader stated that politicians might be able to “mark the pressure” of the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s ministers had said Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if Farage had been a Brexit dealer.
May’s challenge to create a collection in the deeply divided party is emphasized by the fact that conservative remains participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks from both the British, the remaining and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite her retreat, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and thus forced Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
For the demonstration of Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would crush the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough’s minister added: “I want to fight for Brexit, but we need to shake Chequers.”
On the grounds of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subject to anyone.
We will determine our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied that the public's position had to have changed since the 2016 vote: "The British people had to have changed their opinion and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the demonstration and told journalists: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and bring us into the election.
Now drop Chequers, and start listening."
As a top note to May, she added: "Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians should be able to “mark pressure” if they disobey the 2016 vote.
“It’s now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we’re gathered to tell them that we don’t let them leave.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You must make sure that the political class, which is about to betray Brexit, can feel pressure.
“We mobilize the people’s army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governmental and proud UK.”
While marched remains through Birmingham before a two-time recording in the middle of the city.
Spread activists struck with Conservative Against Brexit bands after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis laughed at the security issues of the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
"It is the people who claim to have control of Canada's IT systems and technology, to border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's all laughing.
“There is nothing called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential election
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to uphold the presidential election" after the mid-term elections in November.
According to Boston Globe, Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future during a municipal meeting on Saturday in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, should try to re-election in November against the state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the council since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she planned to stand up to the presidential election.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front.
Detention in the shooting case at LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge police said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday at 11 a.m.
They had released a video from the shooter on Friday to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
20-year-old Sims were shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of the injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul said.
Wayde came in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been present, in possession of a weapon, and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now at the police station in East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 matches, started in ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Botta qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role for the race.
From the driver position, Bottas got a good start and was close to lifting Hamilton completely when he defended his position in the first two spins and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel ran in pit as the first, allowing Hamilton to fight the traffic back in the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into pit later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back as the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact unwillingly had to leave the inner path after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large part of the race, when in a quick finish attempt he failed to switch tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go in pit at 44th round, but could not increase the rate of the last eight rounds, so Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
“It’s a hard day because Valtteri did it amazing all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me go.
The team did an incredible job to ensure that we are both in the first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump denounced Senator Dianne Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she hadn't leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the High Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sex offences.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the statement made by Ford in front of the U.S. Senate court committee, but said instead that the Senate events showed that people were "unfair and contradictory and unfair."
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and evil, contradictory and unfair," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who pulled it out?
Remember her answer... was it you who hid the document - "oh, oh, oh, what?
No, no, no.
I haven't let anything down."
Hov, just a minute.
We've been leaking... No, we've been leaking nothing," he added in a sequence of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter on Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was defeated earlier in September – but Feinstein refused that the defeat came from her office.
"I haven't hid Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did it."
But her rejection was not well received by the President, who said during the Saturday election: "I tell you that it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president’s continued defense of the nominated judge at the Supreme Court, which has been charged with sexual assault by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own case.
“They don’t take any funds in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the wickedness, the contradictions, they don't care who they're going to troop to get power and control," the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants vs Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again after Friday lost Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants quickly came forward with two targets of attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie balanced their homes before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of them.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the season's third Elite League defeat for Adam Keef's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's match in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where Giants appeared to be winner in the three previous matches.
Dwyer released for fourth minute at 3:35 from a assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assistant, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan brought homehold back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants came forward at the first pause when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard balanced again with a great goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the late second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway over the last period.
Giants, now losing four of their five matches, are home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Airplanes died to ensure that hundreds of passengers avoided earthquakes
An Indonesian aircraft carrier was honoured as a whole after he died to ensure that a flight with hundreds of passengers came down on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing, after a major earthquake on Friday hit the Sulawesi Island and unveiled a tsunami.
Strong seizures are still in the area, and many are captured in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agungs colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the swinging control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He returned to his place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who held on the startway, certainly came into the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was by collapsing together.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokeswoman, Johannes Sirait, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're a shark," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach a number of thousands, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of deaths is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly emergency assistance and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with multiple bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the stores are depleted."
Jan Gelfand, Chief of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help survivors, but we don’t know what we are going to do.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask all of you to work around the day to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after the lagoon's flight control
The airline behind the plane that collapsed in the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says a man was missing, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the flying plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini stated that Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline reported that you worked with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for further information on passengers, such as age and nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during the landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were driven in the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers stayed in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in a stable state.
It is still unclear what caused the collapse and the exact sequence of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the aircraft landed in the lagoon in front of the landing trail.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the landing path.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go into the water of life to get to the emergency on the flying plane.
He said that the crew went in panic and cried out, and that he had suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers who worked to renovate a cake nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to ask people in land before the plane fell to about 30 meters of depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines accidents over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts set a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his proof on Saturday during the prosecution of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, issued witnesses for several hours as experts in data analysis.
He described the jury how he used telecommunications to combining the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was in conflict with his former claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed he and his friend Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness disease on Saturday and told him that he was outside the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis spoke true when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "leaved because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said at a time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He has wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
Defence is planned to start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Political Hiphop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Children's Appeals for "Rasistic" SMS shooting couples
A New York childhood woman complains a couple of discriminatory fires after having received a sms message by an error from the mother complaining that she was "a still black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case with "depressing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is the mother of two, expressed fear of finding out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEE, NO END AND SORT PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a SMS.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to sending it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their ex-children, as from African-American, had been bad for her work, and that instead she expected a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day work and sent home in a Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice complains to get compensation for the killing, as well as $350 per day for the six months she should have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I would like to show them that you can't allow yourself to do anything like that," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has defended that they are not racists and that Maurice’s kidnapping was justified because they were afraid they would not be able to rely on her after they had insulted her.
“My wife had come to send her something she wouldn’t have said.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you leave your children to someone you had been unnecessary to, even if it happened by a mistake?
Your baby?
Very honest.”
Plasco compared the case with "depression" and that his wife had been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you really looking for someone in this way?
“It’s not very friendly,” the investment adviser added.
Although the case is still in ongoing, the People's Court has already dismissed social media couples and has dismissed their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington’s publisher feared that readers couldn’t relate to a speaker’s bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said about the letter: “It’s hard to imagine to be the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s quite fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write a child book about a small furniture, would have been optimistic, although his story was rejected, and that the 60s of the release of the books were "bitters dead" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man," she said, "and he didn't want to boast," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real for him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of them, although it’s not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington’s fault.”
Say goodbye to the dead daughter on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
See you again soon.
I'll see you.
The medication she had received to keep her heart running slowly lost her effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now she closed the body.
I just had to sit there and wait until it happened.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together.”
Finally, the sad Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who didn’t know what she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
"I knocked my head, and the towers continued to run.
It’s hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women are trying to stop suicide shooters
Two women who have lost relatives of suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set a map on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed, and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parents to experience the sadness I experience every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said his smile wanted the room up."
However, he stopped working before he died because he really had that shit.
In 2014, Tyler’s eleven-year-old brother found him when he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid of spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to tell people that there is someone you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to anyone.”
Sharon Davis's long-term friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything that he was sorry for it or depressed or something," she said.
“A few days before Christmas he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to go through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's ruined us from each other.
But we all have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still unclear while the FBI starts an investigation
“I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for – a time-limited investigation – we could get a bit of agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would “fall from the back” in the middle of the established partial situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI conducted their investigation?
Their retention is due to timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans, as expected, manage badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they wished to be elected to the country's highest court office.
George W. Bush has called Senators to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unknown whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, giving Vice-President Mike Pence the decisive vote and electing him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean accumulators 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean collectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Convergence and said there were 1,127 collectors last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human traffickers were involved in the changing numbers.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
Over time, most of the North Koreans will receive citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government stated that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people fly through China, which has the longest border to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the abducters as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced to be sent.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still in war – has been significantly improved over the past few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the beached nuclear equipment negotiations.
This takes place after the historical meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea at a general level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"There is no faith in our national security in the United States, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will decompose ourselves," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh for "hysterial" and says he is inappropriate for the Supreme Court
The Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to Supreme Court judges, for "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t think that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s court committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teens.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost shouted and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "a great and coordinated character motif" arranged by the left-wing lion, who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the president's post in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was predetermined to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he followed Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi goes outside when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a kingdom if he is confirmed and if the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say that if he doesn't speak true to Congress or the FBI, he's not suitable to sit in the Supreme Court but also in the court he's sitting right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently seated in the court of appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was worried about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or abortion case Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer the question of whether he would implement certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, predetermined person should dispute a job that judges and expects us to say 'yes, it's not just nice'," Pelosi said.
Women have to use it.
It’s a fair outcome, several months and years of anger, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we become angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal."
She continued: "I got a great upset of a woman who was boss, who said she also wept when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the woman she said: "You may think I'm sorry for it because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just stayed on.
And I thought it was genial.”
Throws are allowed as an expression of anger, partially because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I was often crying of anger, where I was taken at the neck of an older woman – a cold boss I had always been scared – and pulled out of the stairs.
"You should never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will believe that you are sorry for it, and they will be pleased that they have touched you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who at that time was a member of the Congress of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to have an affair with a boat named Monkey Business and acted as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and realized that she could just as well raise herself as president candidate.
"It wasn't a particularly thoughtful decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly didn’t need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dogs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she held a speech that she wouldn’t give up, she became overwhelmed with emotions – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to raise money and now out for voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a clump in her neck.
"You could think I got a nervous use," Schroeder remembers how the press reacted to her.
“I thought I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what will you write on my grave?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be an advantage for Beijing
The opening halls in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle has been over, the split between the countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first wave earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese export goods, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion is in principle applicable to half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has made it in return every time, at the latest by imposing duties of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the U.S. all the way, and the world’s second-largest economy probably does not give it just beforehand.
If it makes Washington retreat its demands, it means they give up, but for China’s President, Xi Jinping, it’s going to be too embarrassed to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its shorts correctly, U.S. pressure in the trade war may have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a groove for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than you thought,” said Abigail Grace, Asian research co-worker at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to receive refugees, Foreign Minister said.
Syria says the country is ready for refugees to return and ask for help to build the country destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working on restoring a normal state.
All the circumstances are now present to allow refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily life and bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since 2011, when the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to take aid to rebuild the armed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept the conditional assistance or assistance from countries that contributed to supporting the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the US team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European ground and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trofee back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points, it required to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulty most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on a pair of 3 on 16 holes, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became one out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest-rated European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 of the world ranking list, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the most winning Europeans of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do it.
It has been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really happy to get the trofee back.
“It’s a team effort and I’m glad I can help,” said Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the faculty to his countryman John Ram, who captured the U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of beating Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It is a spice statistic for one of the best golf players ever won 14 major titles, only overwhelmed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems with finding the form with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing reception: “I am proud of the boys because they fought for the matter.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe an opponent.
You lost.
The hat for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we will proceed.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to make it easy on your hat.
We were defeated."
Update on algeoflowering: concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general declining alge concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, spreading blooming in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier are reported – which suggests that the concentration is declining.
The bloom of algues spreads over a coastline of 210 km from the northern Pinellas County to the southern Lee County.
There are less flowers about 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are less than last week.
There are also flowers in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or to the sea in Pinellas County have been reported over the last week, low to high concentrations in the sea outside of Hillsborough County, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentrations to high concentrations in or to the sea outside of Sarasota County, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or to the lake concentrations in Charlotte County, behind the center of Charlotte County.
There are still respiratory problems in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No breathing problems have been reported in Northwestern Florida last week.
