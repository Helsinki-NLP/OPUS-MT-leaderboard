St. Martin's Campaigns have been defeated as the Church in Harlem is gone
"The elderly people with whom I talked say that in the past there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's nothing of both."
He said that he understood what the bars had disappeared.
"The world is socialized in a different way today," he said.
"Bar isn't anymore the 'salon' of the neighborhood where people frequente regularly."
As regards churches, it concerns that the money from the sale of assets will not keep as the competents hope "and sooner or sooner will return to the point from where they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by multiple houses full of people who will not be willing to help the places of worship that they have stayed in the neighborhood.
"Majority of those who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will hurry the day when all these churches will completely shut, because it is improbable that all those people who will transfer to these apartments will become members of them."
Both churches were constructed by churches of white before becoming Harlem Metropolitan Black - Metropolitan Community was constructed in 1870, St. Martin 10 years later.

Specialist Tiffany Ian, from the University of Michigan, also noted that he was the first career in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lid, who was transformed into a major career in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriguader said that St. Martin's Church had not replaced him.

We also invested in special trained staff that will be available to provide advice.
“The range of our companies is designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and locations atraktive means that now we are a powerful destination for cosmetics, which questiones traditional market mode.”

Identifying whether this is a totally accurate case is the subject of an open history discussion.
The only thing that is certain is that conflicts in the mid-17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a reconnaissable personality representing one side of division.
"See's achievements as Lord Protector's are also dignitative and dignitative."

The numbers weren't immediately made available for other networks that provided hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen normally differs to calculate the number of TV viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
To see this view in the right dimensions, it's a common size analogue to that watching a side-of-football game or the Oscar Awards award festival.
The Fox News Channel, whose reporters strongly supported the nomination of Kavano, progressed with an average of 5,69 million television viewers during the hearing of the day, according to Nielsen.
ABC's 2nd place, ABC's 3,26 million televisitors.
CBS was followed by 3,1 million, NBC by 2,94 million, MSNBC by 2,89 million, and CNN by 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.

However, Felix said that he would do it only if the FBI investigated arguments against the candidate next week, which was demanded by minority Democrats.
Felix was convinced partially after discussions with his friend, General General of the Democratic Party, Chris Kouns.
After discussing with Conns and some other Generals, Felix rushed.
Felix's choice was valid, because it was evident that Republicans wouldn't concentrate votes for approval of Kavano without conducting investigations.

Menga's hit gave Livingston 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Mega's first goal for Livingston Secured the victory
Livingston, arrogant Livingston, triumphed de Reiners, awarding Stephen Gerard just a second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Emprox Group.

Livingston continues inevitably a six-games race in her class, with major coach Holt, who has not been overthrowed yet since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost chances to visitor
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he scored, with his impotence to bring their Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took a step and decided to reach just before the end, but Alan Lithgow rejected his effort by screwing Craig Halkett's head away from the end.
The farmers let Rangers begear to play in front of them, knowing that they could put visitors in free hits and corners.
In this way, the important goal came.
The Rangers couldn't stop a free hit, and Livingston made the opening, Deklane Galhacher and Robinson cooperated to send the ball to Menga, who took all the thing and threw out of the center of the region.
Until that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball's possession, but found inextinguished defence of landlords, and Liam Kelly's terminal guardian did not face difficult situations.
This shape continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos revoked the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pitman's balls were reaped by the feet of the Rangers Alan McGregor's, and the whole of Litgous came out autt in another free hit of Livingston.
Sequentials in Livingston were devastated, and they were constantly responded, while they were asked for two penalties - after the ball was appealed by Halkett against suppleant player Glenn Middleton and one for hand - who were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Elsander Lamoud from the BBC of Scotland on the stadion Tony Macaroni Arena
Thematic performances and results for Livingston.
Independently, they were excellent, overcalling expectations in this highway.
The game style and their personality changed minimally after returning them to a top form, but nature must be given to Holt for the stimulation he gave the team with his arrival .
Sekretariss had so many heroes.
Chef Halkett was excellent, involving a defence that was highly organised, while Mengha held Connor Goldson and Joey Warrel to stand up throughout the game.
Rangers, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
No matter how good they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they weren't responding to these standards.
Their ultimate game was deficit - only once they were able to pass the defense of the landlords and this is a warning campaign for Rangers, who are in the middle of ranking.

US should double finance for artificial intelligence
"Come China act more active in the field of artificial intelligence, USA should duplicate the amount they spend for research in this field, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kay Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Apple and Microsoft.

"Duplication of budget could double chances of happening in America next great achievement in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said in a interview at CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book intitulated "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Class of Things) has a Facetion+Developed by China Enterprises to One+Developed by China+Developed by Simulators, Simulators Simulators by Houghton Miffcourt Harlin

Unfortunately, today, it's not this ton of many meetings and the promise of a "more ambitious, more compassionate" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it's ever really started to implementate.
It's more and more evident that different opinions are not tolerable in the Work Party and that every opinion is judged based on whether it's acceptable by the leadership of the Party.
This started just after Jeremy became leader, because colleagues I thought that we had similar political opinions earlier began to wait for me to rotate 180 degrees and to adopte opinions of the EU, which I would never agree with.
Every time I talked publicly, no matter what I really said, I heard a disgust on social media, where some asked for my refusal, deklarated the politics of the center and said that I should not be a member of the Work Party.
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I really know that I'm more happy than other colleagues, because my comments were usually politically addressed to me.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a shark of sexist or racist offenses everyday, but they never leave.
"One of the most frustrating aspects of this era in politics is how the attacks are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbin affirmed last week that the Working Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
Reality is that we are no longer a wide range and that with any suggestion of muffins or change of rules of choice, the limits of the party are turbulences.
I've been advised for a long time in the last two years that I'm not raised up, that I'm not talking much and that so 'all will be okay'.
“But I didn’t go into politics to do so.
I've been joined in the Work Party 32 years ago, although I was still a student, because of the resignation demonstrated by the Government of Thasser, which literally led to failing in whole my class, my purpose was to defending better public services of the Government Council for those who need it more than locally, or as a member of the Government.
“I never hid my politics and did the same thing in the last elections.

But, really, my only message is not addressed to members of Momentum Movement in South Virginia, but to my voters, whether they're members of the Worker Party or not: I'm proud of serving you and I promised that you're not a threat of rejecting or political imagination like I'm going to give you a promise.

Ir - Malrouz: 38 - 17: Ir invincible ascends to top
Two delayed goals may have slightly rotated the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triomphe in this extraordinarily entertaining today's match of Tened Championship.
It's now at the top of the ranking, the only uncertain group of 10 times.
Finally, it was her supreme defense, as well as the best exploit of opportunities, which resulted in the weight of landlords and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games until now and we're still irrelevant, so I need to be happy."
Robin Christy of Melrose said: "Greetings, Air, we exploited opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converged by Fraser Climate, brought Air forward, but a yellow card to Scotland Rory Huggs, who was awarded to the game by Wallorers.
Climate Increased Air's predecessor with a penalty, before it scored just a half-year-old, a convergence goal, leading Air's to the garniture with a score 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half-year-old well, and Patrick Anderson's goal, converting Bagcott, reduced the precursor to five degrees.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury by Ruared Noth, who was removed by car, and, after restart, Air raised another difference with a goal of Stafford McDowle, converting Climate.
Deputy Chief Blair McCaferson then took a yellow card and Malrouse was reused the numerical advantage with Bruce Colvin goll without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The landlords returned, however, and, when Stuan Hachinson took a yellow card for a double in the Climate without the ball, from the line of the Penalti, McCarterson noted a gol in the back of the attack that Ir exploded.
Climate carried out a conversion, as it did again almost since restart, after Kylie Rowe first collected David Armstrong's knots and sent his ex-creme Gregor Henry away to the fifth goal of the landscapes.

These hopes have been extended today more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultations.

“Eve Morales, a charismatic autonome president of Bolivia, who gives a controversial battle for his reelection next year, has much to win or lose from Monday’s decision.

However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia, and that, even if it did, they would not change much.
"Organization of the United Nations in the Netherlands does not have the power to give thousands of lands and has made clear that it will not determine the result of possible discussions.

Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk sometime, but will be extremly difficult to discuss after that.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Ex-President Edward Rodriguez Belge, spokesman of Bolivia in Haag, rejected the idea that the procedure for the adoption of the judgment of the court was extraordinarily fast.
Bolivia will "have a great opportunity to start a new age of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "dant end to conflicts of 139 years with mutual benefits", he said.
Kazakhstan also rejected that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular leaders of Latin America, uses the issue of exit to the sea as a political decay.

"North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapon if it cannot trust the US
"North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Hoo, says that his state will never dearme nuclear weapons first, if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He invited the United States to fulfil the promises they had made during a summit in Singapore, heads of both states.
Ri made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to restart the nuclear diplomacy that had reached the end three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri stated that the view that the continuing sanctions and the US refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will force Northmans to "goat" a dream of summer night.
Washington insiste on agreeing to issue the deklaration, if Pyongyang doesn't do any important movements of desarmament first.

John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have a history of excellence académica, which continued in 2018, with another series of excellent results in exams, which were simply further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of services to students and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher education grades, the professional career you will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a school study program by order, we see that modern languages still constitute a popular and desirable selection course in schools.
Nelson Mandela, who said, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, then what you say come into his head.
"If you speak to him in his own language, what you say enters in his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English, if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's examinations, we find that languages are at the top of the performance platforms, with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
In total, 68 % of the studentes who studied foreign languages succeeded in graduation A.
Statistics collected by 74 SCIS school members showed that 72 % of the students succeeded in A-liberation degree in Mandarin, while 72 % of the Germanics, 69 % of the Germanics, and 63 % of the Frenchs also studied.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will certainly need children and young people in the future.
Languages today, as a course of choice, are considered as important as courses relating to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in programs of study of independent schools and elsewhere.
Un sondage de la Commission for Employment and Skills (UK) de 2014 reveste que, in relation to the reasons why employers were difficult to cover vacant jobs, 17 % of class was a deficiency in linguistic skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills becomes increasingly urgent, in order that young people be prepared for their future professional career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Independent from the career you'll choose, if you've learned a second language, you'll have a real advantage in the future, because of this skills that you'll be able to use throughout your life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then this multilingual person will automatically have advantage over competitiveness.
According to YouGov’s study of more than 4.000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent of respondents couldn’t speak some foreign language well enough to make a conversation, while French was the only language spoken duplicate percentage of respondents (15 per cent).
Inovation in the language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, particularly of the languages of economies in development, will give children better chances to find employment meaningful.
I Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in 2020, such as mandarin or japanese.
For whatever your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose from independent schools, which have specialized educational staff in this field.
Scotland’s independent schools provide devotedly a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever, and if they preserve the future.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
De facto, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturality and excellence for young Scotland.
They must do.

Trump’s Concentration in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of concentrations starting from West Virginia's Wiling.
It's the first of five planned concentrations of Trump next week, including settings in friendly nearby areas, like Tennessee and Mississippi.

What time is Trump's concentration in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's concentration in Wiling West Virginia is planned for 7:00 ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's concentration in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be referred to auditions of this week for candidate for position in Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, who were in the atmosphere due to claims about sexual crimes, while FBI's weekly investigation was awarded a vote for confirmation of the General of the United States.
However, the principal goal of this series of concentrations is to help the Republicans who faced duplicate outcomes in the elections of November in order to gain some dynamics.
President Trump’s ministry of the campaign said that these five meetings next week aims to "mobilize volunteers and supporters, although Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of those who have in the Senate with Resuters".
"Control of Congress is as critical for his agenda, which the president travels to as many states as possible, as we are traveling to the period of the campaign occupied," said a Reuters spokesman of Trump's campaign, who wanted to remain anonyme.
The meeting planned tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling could bring supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the media of Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News newspaper.
Saturday will be the second time in the month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state that won with difference over 40 percentage units in 2016.
Trump seeks to help Patrick Morrisey, candidate of Republicans in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey the fact that the president must come and try to give him a stimulation to the covers," said Simon Hender, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team has the chance to fight keeping hopes live as it leads to singles Sunday
After three single-party games, Saturday's quarters in the afternoon might even be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talented end of the cord is a totally inspired sport idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such expectations.
"Where would they say that the oath is now?"
"Six grades vore, and now it's four fronts, so, it's probably a little sharp," said Jordan Spitch, while he left for the day.
Europa has, of course, the advantage of progressing in 4 grades, and remaining 12 still in the game.
"Americans, as Spyth says, feel the air in their gates, and they have much to encourage them, like the dual Spyth and Justin Thomas, who played together the whole day and each broke three degrees from the four."
Spyth was deadly from tee to green and gives an example.
The voices of the puzzles became stronger as he continued his round, succeeding in a critical hit to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were under two after two.
The strike with which they won the game in the 15th was accompanied by analogous feedbacks that show his belief that the American team is not out.
"Take a look deep inside and worry about your own game," said Spit.
It's what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more degrees than SPITT and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flittwood, Ryder Cup's undoubted story.
"The strange, but admirable dual of Europe has succeeded in four to four, and it seems that nothing wrong does.
"Moliwood" was the only twin that didn't hit bogey Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way of energy appears to flow to and from the sound viewers, insiste on the fact that they are the players you should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flytwood or Molinari to seal a National Golf or seal a possible European Winning

Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting matches to follow them closely because of interactions between couples, tips they give, tips they don't give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europa has played better as a team until now and has a significant progress in the last day, but this foursome match has also demonstrated that the US team has the cuttings, in spite of some doubts.
Europe receives 10-6 promos on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after its progress in fourballs and foursome Saturdays with 10-6 versus USA.
The inspired twins of Tommy Flittwood and Francesco Molinari formed with two wins against a competitor Tiger Woods and succeeded in the Le Golf National to score four degrees.
The European Side of Thomas Biorn, who is trying to maintain the troop that lost at Hazeltine 2 years ago, dominated the delicate side of America in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The US resisted more foursome, winning two matches, but they could not cover the difference.
Jim Furrick's side needs eight grades of the 12 single matches of Sunday to maintain the troop.
Flitwood is the first European newborn player who wins four degrees series, while along with Molinary, also known as "Moliwood", after a thrilling week-end Cups Ryssee is just the second dual who wins four degrees stories.
"Desputting Woods and Patrick Rids in fourballs, they united their forces to distorsionate Woods and American Newborn Brison DeSampoo with an even more evident 5&4.
Woods, who was awarded in the two matches of Saturday, showed occasional explosions of lightness, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven sides.
Justin Rose, who refreshed for breakfast fourball, returned to Henry Stanson's comrade for foursomes with 2&1 defeat of Justin Johnson and Brooks Capca, won first and third place in the world ranking.
They didn't all go well for Europe, even though a pleasant, frost day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas threw three times the winners Jordan Spitt and Justin Tommass setzte triangle for Americans with two degrees Saturday Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 victory over John Ram and Ian Pauler of Spain in fourballs and returned later to defeat Pauler and Rory McCallroy 4&3 in foursomes while they lost both holes in opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history, a team was able to regain while losing four degrees in singles, although because he is the tropical, Furrick is enough to achieve equilibrium to maintain the tropical.
However, after being positioned in second place for 2 days, it appears that anti-Sunday attacks are beyond their capabilities.

Ri was noted in a public announcement by Kim Yong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between a active president of the United States and a North Korea leader in Singapore for security security on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "support".
North Korea seeks formally to terminate Korean War 1950-53, but USA have said that Pyongyang must first "trade" nuclear weapons.
Washington also protested against calls for relaxation of severe international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"United States continue to "denuclearize first" and increase the pressure threatening sanctions to achieve their purpose by expulsioning them, putting obstacles even to "deklaration of the end of war"", he said.
"Personalization that sanctions can beat us is a dream of those who don't know us.
"Maybe the problem is that continue sanctions deepen our infidelity."
Rie did not report on a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which US leader notified in the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, affirmed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moun Jing in the past five months, and added: "If the partner in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, then such denuclearization would not be Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean Korean ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from the last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the target of the United States container with ballistic missiles North Korea was inevitable because the "Good President" in Ottopol.
Annual in the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "destroy completely" North Korea last year, has opted for Kim's instance for his courage to progress with the dearmament measures, but he has said that there must be still much done, and he has said that sanctions must remain in force.
On Wednesday, Trump affirmed, "Not have timetables for this, and said, "If it takes 2 years, 3 years, or 5 months, it's okay."
China, Russia, China, affirme que UN Security Council should be rewarded Pyongyang for the measures that it has taken.
Mike Pompeo, minister de Foreign Affairs (USA) Mike Pompeo, agreguador de UN Security Council (UN Security Council): "Sanctions from the Security Council must continue intensive, ininterrumpiable, until complete, definitive and confirmed denuclearization".
"The Security Council unanimously aprobated sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to eliminate financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in the United Nations General Assembly and said he would visit Piongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip wasn't good.
He resignated from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been achieved, in order to accuse him North Korea a few hours later that he had "exigences of a gangster".
"North Korea is committed a meeting with Mun this month to sweat a rocket installation and also a nuclear complex, if the United States took "equivalent measures".
"Kim explained that Kim told him that the "equivalent measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and that they promote reconciliation of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students go to lessons on how to relax enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University aims all graduate students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing number of cultures of the study of the night with the consumption of a lot of caffeine.
One academic found that students of the university number 1 in the world often don't know basic things, e.g. how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chiesler, Professor of Medicine of the Harvard Medical School of Medicine and specialist doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which believes he is the first of his kind in the United States.
It was inspired to start the course after a speech about the effects of sleep depression on learning.
"After all, a girl came and said to me, "Why do I learn about this just now, in my last year?"
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sport performance, as well as to improve overall wellness.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were graduated significantly in sleeping week.
The hourly lesson includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, there is the image of a student bedroom, where the students click on cups of coffee, cortinas, sports boots and books, to inform about the effects of caffeine and light, how the signification of sleep, the sport performances are influenced by default.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep depression can increase risk of vomiting, cervical, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students.
"We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the impacts on health when you choose to smoke," added Professor Chiesler.
His culture of being proud because you studied the whole night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pression to students means that sleeping is a problem that is inflamed.
Sufficient sleep, good quality, should be the "secret gun" of students to combate stress, exacerbation and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep depression puts the brain in a state of devastation.
Raymond Shaw, 19-year-old Californian, who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, assisted Professor Chiesler in designing the lesson, after attending one of his classes last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said that the lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to press a lesson in the whole university.
The next step, hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar program before they start their studies in this particularly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler advised students to regulate a warning for the time they should go to sleep, as well as a vexer for the time of awakening, and to know the harmful consequences of the "blue light" problem emitted by electronic screens and LED speed, led lighting, which can be disconnected
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga sets goals to Jerry's men
The Rangers suffered another tragic defeat outside of the seat, as Dolly Mega's defeat led Stephen Gerard's decoordinated side to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Emprox team sought to mark the first victory off sitting from the February triomphe with 4-1 in Saint-Johnston, but Gary Holt team provocored just Gerard's second victory in the first position in 18 matches, which is the firstbro in the game as a coach, leaving the team back 8th ranking
Menga hit seven minutes before a half-hour and the inspirational rosters of Rangers seemed incapable to refunde.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"Reindsers can expect other difficulties, since supervisor Callum Spens needed first-hand help to lesionate the head caused by an object that was flipped out of the outlet.
Gerard made eight changes in the team's composition, and infiltrated Eir in the semifinals for the Betfred Cup.
Independent, Holt went with the same composite "Libye 11", which took a degree from Harts last week, and would be happy with how this english machine could have been able to overcome every effort of opponents.
Rangers could have dominated the occupation, but Livingston did more with the ball.
I would have scored in the second minute, when the first distant whole of Mega sendte Scott Pittman into Alan McGregreor region, but the middle didn't find the ball.
A deep free suit of Kigan Jacobs found Chef Craig Halkett, but the defender of Alan Lithgow's companion was the only thing he could do was to send the ball away from the doctor.
Rangers rushed, but it seemed that there was more hope than faith for the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morellos seguramente believed that he should have won a penalty in the 15', as he conflicted with Stephen Loules, but arbitrator Stephen Thomson ignored Colombian's complaints.
Rangers had only two subtitles in the region in the first half year, but the ex-terminal guard of Himprox, Liam Kelly, was inconceivable of Lassa Kulibali and the subtitles of Ovi Eggara.
Although Libye in the first 34 minutes of the match was clearly inferior to expectations, nobody can refute that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
Reinsers was unable to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arphild was unable to react when Declane Galhaher rushed the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained his cold and found Mega, who just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the semi-year-old, kick Culibally out and put Ryan Kent in the semi-year-old. Changed almost instantly, while the extruder rushed the ball to Morellos, but the impressive Kelly rushed out of his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to adorna hosts in the game style that he knows and enjoys, with Litgous and Halkett to remove one long ball after the other.
Holt's side might have been able to increase the difference to the end, but McGregreor confronted James's equals, stoping him before Litgous's efforts from Corner.
Deputy Rangers, Glenn Middleton, had a second stage of penalty to the end, as he was confronted with Jacobs, but Tomson ignored it again.
Germanic: The inventor of the Gaiker meter
A page of the Germanic Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882: like today, 136 years ago and BALE ... the day that was born in Germany the future physician John Wilhelm "Hans" Gaiker.
Gaiker has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity. This invention ultimately led to the device now known as Gaiker Counter.
A pillar of science since then, the contador Gaiker passed in the sphere of the pop culture, like in the 1950 film titled Bells of Coronado, with their protagonists of unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Davis Evans:
"What's this guy?"
Rogers: "It's a Gaiker meter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, like sky.
"When you wear these earphones, you hear the action of people caused by radiation in metal elements."
Evans: "Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Hans Gaiker died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
Yet, the invention that brings his name continues to work.
New anticancer vaccine teaches immunodeficiency how to "see" problem cells
New anticancer vaccine teaches immunodeficiency how to "se" problem cells and how to kill them
Vaccine teaches immunitarian how to recognize problem cells in the context of treatment
The method includes exporting immunocellulars from the patient and modificing them to the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and continue to be re-infused
A tested vaccine presents hopeful results in patients with different types of cancer.
Ladies who were treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system how to identify problems cells, saw cancer of the ovaries disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes exportion of immunocellulars from the patient, modification of them to the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-infusion of cells.
Profesor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Beethoven, Maryland, said: "Resultats show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofsky explained, protein HER2 "is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer" such as cancer of the chest, ovaries, pulmonary and thick intestine.
a similar approach to which immunocellulars are exported from patients and then "instrued" how to target cancer cells has been used for the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kannie West defended Trump, wearing a hat with the MAGA logo, after his appearance in SNL.
It didn’t go well
Kannie West was deported in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an interview in which he approved President Donald Trump and said he would be candidate in elections in 2020.
After presenting also the third song for the evening, titled Ghost Town, in which he weared a baseball chapel with the Make America Great Again slogan (Let us make America Great Again), he gave a receipt of fraudulentness against the Democrats and resumed his support.
"I'm often talking to a white man and he says to me, 'How do you like Trump? He's racist?"
"Si rasism turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences turbulences tur
The SNL opened it with a sketch in which Matt Damon was a protagonist, with Hollywood's star to disclose Bret Kavano's report in front of the Secretariat's Court Committee on Critin Blazi Ford's complaints about sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't transmitted, West's parable video was up on social media by Chris Rock's comedy.
I'm not clear if Rock squadroned West with this post.
Independently, West protested to the public that they weren't treated well in the scenes because of his cappuccino.
"Sie me bosnick in the scenes.
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I've been bullying!
"And they say that I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
"Wess" continuo: "I don't know what's going on to me? "I don't wear some superman, because so nobody can tell me what to do." "I don't want to go to the world?"
Try love.”
His comments were tested at least twice by the public and SNL coefficients seemed to be in a difficult position, the Variety, with a person declaring in the magazine: "The whole studio possessed a mortal silice".
West was called a substitute for the last minute of the singer Ariana Grante, whose ex-friend, Raper McMiller, had exploded a few days earlier.
West laughed several when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West, Kandas Turner, CEO de TPUSA Conservative Group, affirmed: "Para una de las corajest spirites: JEHOVAH JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH."
Karen Hunter, deputate of the show, insiste, "West is just "seu, and that's great."
"Pero, I choose to NOT reward someone (buy his music, or his clothes, or support his "art") who thinks that he insistes on and exposes a ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“Again we,” he added.
Before the show, Raper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the one that was previously known as Cannie West".
He is not the first artist who changes his name and follows the steps of Danny, also known as Paph Daddy, Paph Paffy and P. Diddy.
Raper Snow Dog had changed his name to Snow Leone, and of course the legend of Prince Music had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince (The Artist formerly known as Prince).

HIV/Aids: China Reports Increase 14% in New Events
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820.000 people are affected, according to Health Services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were reported about 40.000 new incidents.
In their vaste majority, new incidents were transmitted via sexual contact, signaling a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly to some parts of China due to transfusions of kontaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost zeroed, as China's health officials claimed at a conference in Yunan Province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmitting HIV via sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LOT community of China.
Homosexuality was denialized in China in 1997, pero discrimination in βάρος LOT community remains a common phenomenon.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men ultimately will get married women.
Many incidents of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's Government has promised universal access to drugs anti-HIV, as part of an effort to address this problem.

Johnny English Review - a hypotonical spion film with Ryan Atkinson
It's now tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new film with a character british and this seems to be valid in this revival of action-commodity franchise films with hero Johnny Ingles, which started in 2003 with Johnny English film and revolte in 2011
..doeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
Ignorable Johnny Ingliss with the eyes of pillowed could renew his permission to make them a mantra for second time. His name states that it is a broader creation comedy designed for non-anglais film viewers.
Naturally, it's a terrible secret agent whereas it's supposed to have brilliance and ways of a secret agent, brings a little to the Cluz, with a dosage of "Girl Bin" and something from the type of Lodson's Lodson's Game of Thrones Played one single notes in the music subject of the movie "The Devil's Devils"
It is also based on a traveler and international mystery man who once subdued Atkinson to Barclaycard's most forgotten TV ads, triggering chaos in his parade.
"There's one or two beautiful moments in this last film of JE.
I liked when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in ankle medieval arms, and the ladies hit his crane.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, humor is fairly subtonic and strange paradise, especially when "serious" film franchise like the 007 and dangerous Mission now contain a lot of comedy elements.
Humor seems to be addressed to children, and not adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny Ingles's crazy opinions are not just as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's film boobs sketches for Bin's cross.

And that means Johnny Ingles, who now works as director in aristocratic school, but gives unofficial lessons for agents of mystery: here are some beautiful scenes, since Ingles offers a academia de spion type A School of Polly Rock.

Labourers desperatemente deployed plans for brits to work four days, but to pay for five days
Jeremy Corbin’s Worker Party will considere a radical plan for brits to work four days a week, but pay for work day-to-day.
The Party, according to information, seeks the managers of companies to control the savings achieved through the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (I) to the workers, giving them an additional freeday.
So, workers will enjoy three days of weekend, without reducing their salaries.
Sources report that the idea coincide with the economic agenda and the plans of the party in order to return the weight for workers.
The change in four-day week was approved by the Congress of Labor Coordinations as a means of benefiting employees from the changing economy.
In The Sunday Times, a senior source of the Worker Party said: "Evented change in politics will be announced before the end of the year.
"Indeed, this will not happen in a night, but the four-day work week is a ambition that is aligned with the approach of the party to rebalance the economy for workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party for industry."
The Working Party is not the first to support such a idea, as the Prison Party promised a four-day working week in its general electoral campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is currently not supported by the entire Worker Party.
"The four-day work week isn't a political party and isn't considered by the party."
The secretary of the Shadow Government, John McDonald's, used the Conference of Workers last week to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonald's said that he is determined to regain power from "individual managers" and "profits" in joint ventures.
The plans of the secretary of the Shadow Government also mean that today's shareholders in water companies may not take back their entire share, as a potential government of Workers could lead to "contraventions" due to suspicioned appetite.
Adequate plans de placement of employees in the management boards of companies and the creation of mutual capital participation, in order to give 10% of the private sector firms a employees who will receive annual shares of up to 500 GBP per an.
Lyndsey Graham and John Kennedy streaming 60 Minutes to see if FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh could change their opinion
FBI's investigation of accusations against judge Bret Kavano delayed the final vote on his candidature to Supreme Court for at least 1 week, and raised the question of whether the conclusions of the service could affect some of the Republican Representatives for General Generals.
In a interview Sunday, Scott Pelley, respondent of 60 Minutes broadcast, asked the Republican General John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if FBI could delete anything that would make them change their opinions.
Kenny appeared more open than his companion than South Carolina.
"Eh, yeah, he's going to say," he's said.
"I'm saying that when I'm going to the hearing, I talked to judge Cavanano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out in the shirt, and I asked him straightforwardly, "What did you do?"
"He was unfair, determined, accused."
No, however, Graham's vote seems to not to change.
"I've decided about Bret Cavano, and I'll need some explosive category to change my opinion," he added.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett rejected it intensely," adds Graham, referent to Christine Blazi Ford.

What is Global Citizen Festival and how much has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and famous stars, as well as an equally impressive mission: elimination of global poverty.
Seven years ago, diez millenniums are expected to run in the Great Lawn of Central Park in the context of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi Bee and Son Points, but also to sensibilize to the final of 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the expansion of Global Poverty Project, a global press team hoped to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of actively fighting against it.
in order to ensure free ticket at the event (except if they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties needed to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as declaring voluntarys, sending emails for targets of the world leader to call a message to someone global leader.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of award with a free concert the right way to persuade our citizens to take action, or is it just another case of the so-called "click-click" (click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click-c)?
Since 2011, Global Citizen Group has recorded over 19 million "actions" by its supporters, promoting a series of different targets.
"These actions helped leaders of the world announcing commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2,25 billion people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from these operations, of which have already been deposited or accumulated at least $10 billion.
The team estimates that the hedge funds have impacted instantly nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the fundamental commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British Association of Investors and implementers, who have engaged the commitment "to help children to fully exploit their capabilities", promising to give to Romania twos700 of the Globality over twosts from Romania 35 million dollars for the elimination of subnutrition.
"Med the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments, and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of subnutrition a subnote in history," said Trey O'Malley Ulman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition 2018, in The Power of Nutrition.
The Group also stated that after the 5,000 actions and more than UK calling to improve diet for mothers and children, the government announced financing of a project titled The Power of Nutrition, directed to 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
Response to the question "What makes you think that we can eliminate extreme poverty?", which is included in frequently asked questions on the website,
"Latch will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
Pero, like all the great movements for human rights and dependence before us, we will succeed, because we are united more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Whikeed, Son Minds, Cardi Bey and Janel Mona are some of the artists who will appear this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Li-Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
US can use Navy Military to "explora" by hindering Russia's energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington can "if necessary" return to its Navy of War in order to impede disclosure of russ energy on the markets, including Middle East, according to US Interior Minister Ryan Zenke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, where she attempts to invite the legitime government, is a motivation for exploration of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they do in East and South Europe", he said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with the Russian activity.
"United States have the ability, with support of the Navy of War, to ensure that maritime paths will remain open and, if necessary, exclude them, to ensure that russ energy will not be marketed," he added.
Zenke was addressed to the participants in the context of the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group characterized as the "voice of energy consumer" in the USA.
He has compared Washington’s approaches to confrontation with Russia and Iran, noting that they are basically the same.
"Economic choice for Iran and Russia is, little much, exploitation and substitution of fuel," he said in Russia, referring to the term "forest that only knows a stroke", as he has a economy dependent on mineral fuel.
Declarations have taken place as the Trump administration has taken the mission to strengthen exports of American gas liquided gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
"Trump's administration, inklusive President Donald Trump's own, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin "participated".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a project with a budget of 11 trillion dollars, which will double the existing capacity of the pipelines to 110 trillion cubic meters, is a net project economic.
Kremlin argumented, dass Washington’s loyale resistency to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of irregular competition.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy can't be a means of exercise pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose the gas supplyer they want," - agreed Alexander Nowak, russe minister de energies, agreed after a meeting with minister of agencias de EE.
The US attitude provoked Germany’s reaction, which stressed its commitment to implementation of the project.
Germany's leading organisation for the industry, the German Industry Federation (BDI), invited USA to abstain from EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when any third state intervene in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angelo Angela Merkel and Rosso Presero.

A week after official Chinese newspaper published a four-year-old advertisement in a US daily newspaper overwhelming the mutual trade benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using a US pro-American Tissue.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, noted last Wednesday on the charged item of China Daily, which appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with the most sales in the state of Iowa, after he accused China of seeking to mixte in Congress elections on 6 November, China, a November, a September.
Trump’s accusation de Beijing’s impediment to interfere with the elections of America signalized what US officials reported to Reuters that it was a new phase of a climb campaign that Washington has combated in order to exercise pressure in China.
Although it is not prohibited by foreign governments to publicize ads for promoting their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a global trade war and have imposed mutual tariffs on import.
China's customs-oppositions at the beginning of the trade war were intended to impact exporters into states such as Ayova, supported by the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.

China, as Brandt wrote in a commentary article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is administered to this kind of fear publicing propaganda ads in our free press."
"In the effort of spreading this propaganda, China's government exploits the precious tradition of freedom of speech and the free press of America, publishing awards on payment in the Des Moines Register", - wrote Brandenstein.
"Independently, in Beijing, you will find minimal voices differentiating and no real representation of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have about the problematic economic path of China, because the media are under control of the Communist Party of China."
"One of China's most important newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal who.
"Republicans separate women voters in view of interim elections due to the student with Kavana, analytiker warns
As many leading Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh, despite the complaints about abuse sexual, the analysts warn that there will be reaction, particularly women, in the next interim elections.
"Emotions about this issue are particularly delicate, and the majority of Republicans have stated that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be restored," said Grant Rier, professor of Political Science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, regarding an article published Saturday.
Rier doubts that the movement of the last minute of General Jeff Flick (R-Arisona) to request investigation from FBI will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will certainly not forget it on November," said Carin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for Press, Washington.

Even before Ford’s public report, in which she described in detail her complaints of abuse sexual against a candidate for the Supreme Court, the analysts had anticipated that there might be reacción as soon as Republicans progresse with a shame.
"It's a huge chaos for the Republican Party," said Michael Still, ex-president of the National Committee of Republicans, at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee, or about the final vote, or whether Kavano will be set out. It's also having to do with how Republicans handled the issue and how they handled it", annoncated Gay Sesil assistentes in a news channel. Priori Group Manager
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divorciated about who to believe after the deposits of Fortton and Cavanaugh, eating a little more in favor of the second.
A New Survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the questioned probably believed Ford's depozit, while 35% deklarated that they believed Cavanato.
In addition, 38% said that he believed that Kavanaugh probably or certainly had lügs in his deposito, while just 30% said the same about Ford.

MMA's fans visited Bellator 206, but they saw Papa's Gurunaki
Think of the following scenario: you've visited nights to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you're missing the pleasure to see this unique sport event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six main cards, and would be promoted live in the UK, from Channel 5, in the Night Zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gagward Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for rigs, the British viewers remained silent when the show changed Pepa's Gurunaki.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley se sent "lower" because of his sexuality
The Olympics in the invasion, Tom Daley, said that he had grown up feeling inferior to the rest due to his sexuality, but this permitted him to succeed.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until school, "I'm not all like me."
Talking to the first Desert Island Discs presented by Loren Lavern at Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of gays to give others "hope".
"Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Kirsty Yang, regular representant of the radio broadcast known, was released several months ago because of the disease.
Invited to Lavern's first broadcast, Dalee said that he felt "inadequate" compared to others when he greased, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like someone, both boys and girls."
"Today, these sentiments of inferiority and diversity have given me strength and will to succeed."
"He wanted to prove that he was something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The Dual Calcin Olympics is a protector of the rights of the LOATKI community and has exploited his participation in the Games of Commonwealth this year in Australia to call for more countries to progress in defaultization of homosexuality.
"He said that he decided to speak, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without impacts, and that he wanted to give another "hope".
The three-time world champion said "it was a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dastin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013.
Dalee is married last year to Oscar Dastin Lance Black, who is 20 years old, but he argued that age difference was never issued.
"When you pass so much in such a little age" (the first time participated in the Olympics at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it is difficult to find a companion who has similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Deli, and Daley claimed that he changed "all his perspective".
"If you asked me last year, only what I wanted was to gain gold medal," she said.
"Men, there's more important things than golden olive medalje.

Dalee said that his father didn't accept the fact that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had to get tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, since he wanted to be in the first series.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Papa, you'll not be with us to sit in the first series'.
"I holded his hand, just when it stopped breathing, just when it stopped breathing, and was already dead, and I finally accepted that it wasn't invincible," he added.
Next year, Daley triumphed for 2012 Olympics and won metal medalje.
"I knew that it was what I dreamed all my life, that I could fight in the matching of the Olympics in my homeland, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of the first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which inspired him while preparing for the Olympics, and even provoking him anxiety.

Without having ever had the most convenient driver even at the outset of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the close Le Golf National square, where the distances are often problematic.
"Michelson, in the 9th match of Sunday, confronte Francesco Molinari, champion of British Open, who cooperate with Tim Flytwood, first-born, to win four weeks this week.
If Americans, who were four degrees below the beginning of 12 singles, could take the lead with a good start, Michaelson game could be crucial.
Furrick expressed his confidence in his player, no he could say anything else.
"Han accepted full the role he plays today, hit me friendly on the back, laid his hand around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," he said.
"Han har stor självförtroende.
Its name is in Hall of Fame and has offered a lot in these groups, both in the past and this week.
I've probably not counted him to play two games.
I thought more, but there we finished, and so we thought that we needed to go.
"He wants to go out there, like all the others."
Michaelson won't overcome Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday matches in Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which didn't reach the sum of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 victories, 20 kastiges, 7<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4
"He's funny, corpustic, spirituous, he likes to make plates, and he's great in the room of the group," she explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed to experimentate him this week, was funny to see him.
"Hann's contribution isn't just game."
Thomas Biorn, chef de la europaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeae
Thomas Biorn, chef of the European Group, knows from his experience that a big forward starting from the singles of the last day at Ryder Cup can be easily converted into a defeat.
Danish made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team with leader Sheve Balsterros managed to gain five-grade advantages versus Americans, but just after he managed to pass the final line with differences in breasts, 132<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2, won 14<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1
"Siempre remembered that we had a great passion in Valderrama, we had a great passion in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just after violence," Biorn, on the image, a gets like National, a watching the generation of 2018, and Le wins like Le win 5-3
So historia will show to me and to all members of the team that this hasn't finished.
We're all ready to go tomorrow to give everything.
We'll go out there and play correctly.
I'm not finished anything until you see the grades in the table.
We have a goal, to win this troop, and we focused there.
“I always say that I focus on 12 players in our team, but we know very well that in the other team there are equally good players – the best in the world.”
Beyond, aligned with the performance of his players on a hard golf course, adds: "I wouldn't hesitate to prejudice the result.
Tomorrow is another animal.
Tomorrow it counts individual performance and that's something different.
It's wonderful to be on the ground with a companion when things go well, but when you're out there alone, then you're experiencing your skills as a golfer.
This is the message you need to transmit to players, how to get the best of themselves tomorrow.
"Leave your friend back and he must give everything and show him the best of himself."
Unlike Beyond, Jim Furrick of the opponent team will ask his players to perform better individual performance than those they had with their comrades, except Jordan Spitch and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Furrick himself has experienced both ends of the turnovers of the last day, as he belonged to the winners team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europa did her miracle.
"I remember every speech of his word," responded when asked how Ben Krenso, chef in 1999, had collected his players for the last day.
"We have 12 games important tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like Medinah.
"When we win this race, there's a great pressure in intermediary matches.
“We decide our turn accordingly, and we play our turn, we will try to make our magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has taken to lead the match and confronted Rory Macilroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Roses, John Ram, Tommy Flittwood and Ian Potter, the rest of Europeans over the half of the series.
"I went with this group in this series, because I think it covers the whole path," Bionn said, justifiant his choices for singles.
New Release for Germany’s New Warship
"The new fleet of the German Navy should have been put in service in 2014, in order to replace the old warships of the cold war period, but it will not be received at least next year, due to defect systems and cost inflatable, report local media.
The position of the Rheinland-Pfalz fragrance, Baden-Wuerttemberg fragrance fragrance, has been suspended until the first semester 2019, according to Die Zeit, which is called for a representative of armed forces.
Navy should have been joined in the Navy War in 2014, but the problems with delivery were crucial for the sort of ambitious plan.
The Baden-Wuerttemberg-class four ships ordered by Navy War in 2007 will replace Bremen's oldest bretagne.
They will bring a strong canon, a series of anti-airport missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies, such as cut radar, sub-red and audio signatures.
Other important characteristics is that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use new fregates for up to two years except for German ports.
Continuous delays, however, mean that, although vessels militares are considered ultimate technology, which will allow Germany to show its power in the exterior, until they end up service, they will already be overcome, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 fragta crash became the first week last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy of War returned to a shipship after delivery.
There was no known much information about the reasons for return, but the German media reported a series of significant "crashes with software and hardware" that would have been inutilized the warship if they were used in a battle mission.
Problematik software was particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have ca. 120 marine crews, just half compared to Bremen's oldest bretagne.
Also, it has been revealed that the ship has a much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz-Freight of 7.000 tons (Rheinland-Pfalz-Freight of 7.000 tons) is believed to have a dual weight of the vessels of similar classes used by Germans during World War II.
Except for defect equipment, the cost of the entire work (inclusive crew training) was also a subject.
It is said that it has reached the total total of 3,1 trillion EUR (3,6 trillion EUR), while the initial budget was 2,2 trillion EUR.
"Problems, devastating from the new freights, are particularly important, da Germany's maritime force is turbulent.
Initial this year, Hans Peter Bartels, chef defensive committee of the German Parliament, admitted that Navy War "in a little bit will not have a ship for missions".

National Trust Crimps the Secret Life of Nights
New research carried out in a farm in Hollywood, Scotland, seeks to find out how nightmares use the landscape when they hunt their food.
The findings will bring new light into the behavior of these unique flying infants and will contribute to the design of future actions for the protection of the environment.
The study of National Trust for Scotland by scientists will explore habits of common nanoparticles and micronoparticles, as well as Domendo's otonoparticles and myotis in Inverewe Gardens Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special subscribers will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of nights throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Analysis of sound of all audio records by specialists will check the frequency of calls of nights, as well as what kinds of these behaviors have.
Then, it will be created a biotope map and a exhibition, so that it will form a detailed image of their behavior in scale of landscape.
Robert Duwar, Environmental Protection Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will discover which areas of the biotope are more important for nightclubs and how they are used by every kind.
This information will help to identify the benefits of management of biotopes, such as forestry creation and the best way of maintaining forests for nocturnes and other related species.
The population of nights in Scotland and throughout United Kingdom has declined significantly since last century.
They are threatened by construction work and development projects that affect the areas where they cane and destroy their habitat.
Windgenerators and lighting are also a risk, as well as films de companionships for muffins and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks by cats domesticated.
The nights are actually not blind.
Although, because they chase the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their tears.
They use a Advanced Audio Identification Technical to detect insectes and obstacles in their flight course.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76.000 hectares of land lands throughout the country, considers the nights very important.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular investigations, inspect the places where the noon crashes and sometimes save them.
The organization has also created Scotland's first and unique refuge exclusively for nights in Threave, Damfriss and Galoway, where eight of the 10 species of Scotland's nights live.
David Thomson, the building manager, says that the property is the ideal ground for nightclubs.
"Here in Threave, we have an excellent area for nights," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and a perfect biotop.
“There’s still much that we don’t know about the nights, so the work we’re doing here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need to increase their population.”
It stresses that it is important to first make a check for the existence of nights before any maintenance work in houses, as destruction of one single butterfly with little could kill up to 400 females and small, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Nights are protected species, and it is prohibited to kill them, to injure them, to disturbe their calm, or to destroy their fouls.

Ronaldo rejects complaints for rape, as his advocates are preparing to send German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo karakterised complaints of violation against him as "fake news", saying that some "have to be self-produced" using his name.
His advocates are going to send German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The agressor of National Portugal and Juventus is accused of violating a American woman named Catherine Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, it is claimed to pay her $375,000 to buy her silence and to notify anything about the incident, according to Der Spiegel Friday.

"No, no, no, no, no.
"What they said today is fake news," said 5 times Gold Balls winker in the camera.
"Euer, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, de
-Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
They want to become famous using my name, but this is part of my work.
“I’m happy and everything’s fine,” adds player smiling.
Ronaldo's advocates prepare to send Der Spiegel for the claims he posted, which they characterized as "unacceptable report of honors touching privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Scherts said that the player would ask for compensation for "etical damage to height of proportional gravity of violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The alleged event is said that it took place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After their introduction in a nightly entertainment center, Ronaldo and Majorca returned to the player's room, where they were forced to violate her beyond nature, according to documents submitted to the Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga argumented, Ronaldo spadnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav poltnav
The documentation states that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual contact, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga assert also that she went to police and hospital where her traumas were photographed, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because "she feared the possibility of anti-inflammatorys" and was concerned about her "public evacuation".
34-year-old says she is trying to stop the settlement, as she continues to suffer from transtraumatic syndrome due to the suspected incident.
Ronaldo was in the windows to receive transponder to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the period of suspected abuse, and this summer he transferred to Italian Euventus, asking for an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "will regrette eternal" loss of automotive industries
UK "will regrette forever" if she loses her reputation as a global leader in automotive industry after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
"It was "anxiety" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain abandoned EU without agreement, it would temporarily cease production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," claimed Clark.
"Japanese automotive industry said that impact of transfrontaliers delays in case Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
Auris and Avensis Toyota’s models are fabricated in Bernaston, the factory has transported almost 150.000 automobiles last year, 90 % of which have been exploded to rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves EU to the end of March, production will cease our factory," said Marvin Cook, CEO de Toyota, Bernaston.
And other automotive industries in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on transfrontalier trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, por ejemplo, has stated that it will close Mini Factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The fundamental concerns concern risks in supply chain according to automotive industries in case Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line follows just-in-time. Pieces arrive every 37 minutes by suppliers both in UK and EU for automobiles manufactured according to order.
"If UK abandone EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at borders, resulting in delays and lack of components according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold stocks over one day at its factory in Derbyshire, according to the company, so production would stop.
Mr. Clarke affirme que Teresa May's plan for future relationships with EU "have initiative specific to resolve the issue of transfrontalier controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best possible deal that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to exploit this opportunity", aldus BBC Radio Today.
"Demands that come not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that it must necessarily be sure the continuity of supply chains."
Toyota was not able to say how crude it would stop production, however, warned that in the long term, the extra cost would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Chuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the Union Unionist of the Factory, said that members of the body are cada vez more concerned: "Desde my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return again.
A spokesman of the Government said: "We have presented a plan accurate and reliable for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may delay again, declare White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Vice Prosecutor-General Rond Rosenstein may "define another week", as the dispute about the candidate to the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosjenstein supervises the work of the expert investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates russ intervention in elections, interconnections of Trump’s assistants with Russia, and possible impediment of justice by the president.
Trump's chance de liberar viceprosecutor general, menaçante Mueller's independence, alimentar Washington's pockets for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a coral to record his conversations with Trump and make it possible to remove president based on 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House in the midst of reports that he was supposed to resign.
Instead, it was announced on Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations Agency in New York City.
Trump said, "I'd prefer" not to release Rosenstein, but the meeting delayed in order not to agree with the auditions before the Committee on Discrimination Committee of the Senator, to which both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sex sex.
On Friday, Trump ordered FBI to investigate claims against Kavanaugh in a week, delaying more vote than Senate plenary.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's journalist, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "Non has been fixed a date, maybe this week, but maybe another week of data of all the other cases occupied by the Supreme Court.
But we'll see it, and I like to always update the guy."
Several journalistes protested against this argument: Sanders has made press updates in the White House from 10 September.
Mr. Chris Wallace interrogeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Sanders responded, "Santhers, la limitada frequency of the updates, was not due to arrogance to "impressioning" movements of journalists of TV, although she said: "I will not agree with the fact that they are shown".
Then, it laughed to mean that it would increase or direct communication between Trump and the type.
"President gives more interviews than any pre-President," he added, adding, "we looked at them these numbers."
"Santhers said, 'If this type has the ability to ask questions direct to President of the United States, this is incomparably better than to talk to me.
"We are trying to implemente it often and you saw that we've implemented it often in the past few weeks and it'll take the position of the press update where you can talk to President of the United States."
Trump often accepte questions when he leaves White House or participate in open meetings or press interviews with official visitors.
Individual media interviews are rare.
In New York City, this week, the president must have demonstrated why this is happening, with a contradictory and sometimes strange appearance in front of concentrated journalists.

Ministry of Finance expects to accumulate up to 120 million pounds of England per year - to provide assistance to astronauts
Buyers abroad will begin to impose a higher rate of cash for the purchase of real estate in the UK, while additional amounts of money will be used to provide assistance to astronauts, as Teresa May will announce today.
The measure will be regarded as a attempt to eliminate the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises of more economic housing and to target high-ends.
The increase in the end of the carter will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the UK, while the additional amounts of money will strengthen the government’s campaign to combate deficiency of roofing.
The increase, imposed on the current end of the carter, along with the highest tax rates imported 2 years ago for the purchase of second residence and residence for settlement, can be reached three percent.
Ministerial of Finance expects that the measure will cost up to 120 million pounds of England per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newlywed real estate in London are purchased by people who are not residents in the UK, leading to price increases and making it more difficult to enter the first real estate buyers into the market.
Many rich regions of the country - particularly in capital - have become "city fantasies" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend their most time abroad.
"The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the end of the card, so that more young people could gain their first residence.
He accused the major construction companies that they kept the prices of real estate high, gaining land without, however, to use it and invite Mrs. Mai to remove the plateau in economic housing to restore the "establishment" of Britain.

Jack Ross: "My absolute ambition is to traine Scotland team"
Jack Ross, Santerland's Chef, declare, "See absolute ambition" is sometimes become coach of the national team of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enthusiastic with the challenge of resurrecting the team of Northeastern England, which is currently in third place in England's League One, three degrees below the top.
He was moved to Light Stadium in the summer, after he had previously brought St. Miren back to Scotland Championship in the previous race season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
"I received a call for the second national team, and that was it," said Russ at BBC of Scotland in Radio Sportsound.
"But i've grown up watching Scotland's team in Hubden constant with my father as a child, and that's something that always pulled me back.
"Mai, i'll beat this opportunity only if I'll be successful in training teams."
Among the predecessors of Roosevelt in Southernland are Dick Adbocahat, David Moyes, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Pojeet, Paul Dee Cannio.
Aloa Atletic’s ex-treiner notifies that he wasn’t feeling anxiety when he was invited to accepte such anxiety names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me will be measured based on response to the question "Can I bring this group back to Premier League?"
"Due to the structure and installations of this team, it is unquestionably part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy work to get it there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross started his career as coach just three years ago, having spent a long time as coach assistant at Dabarton and a long time 15 months at Harts coach staff.
Then helped Aloa recovering from the subtitle to the third category and led St. Mirane from the lips of the subtitle to the victory of the Champions League next season.
Also, Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clayd, Hartelpool, Fullerck, St Miren, and Hamilton Kandemikal.
"It's probably a real cruise," said, recording to take the position of coach Aloa.
"I really thought that it me preferred to be coach rather than player.
It sounds strange because I went well, I took the worthwhile money from that and I got quite high.
But playing can be difficult.
You must wait for a lot of time in a week base.
I still experience difficulties in terms of stress and pressure of work, but work of my coach is perfectly suited.
I always wanted to traine, and now that I do it, I feel more comfortable than I felt myself in my life adult.”

The best time for beer is at 5.30m Saturdays, according to research
The summer carbon has strengthened the profits for the British bombs tested, but has brought greater pression on the chains of restaurants.
Pubs and bars noted sales increases de 2,7 per cent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased de 4,8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA Business Advisory Company, who collected data, said: "Continuous sunset and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July.
La reduction de 1,8 per cent in revenue de restaurante in June just aggravated in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcoholics have gone long better, with equivalente elements of the previous years have ascended more than equivalente elements of restaurants fallen.
Pubs serving dinner also suffered sunny days, although not so dramatic as restaurants.
It seems that the world just wants to go out to drink.
"In all the pabbs and bars, the beverage sales increased by 6,6 per cent per month, while the sales of food decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Neuman, from RSM Analyst and Hospitality Department, said: "This results confirm the trend we found since April.

It is not surprising that the group of restaurants continues to be difficult, but the fall in sales by 4,8 per cent per year would be particularly painful data of continuing cost pressure.
"The long hot summer could not have appeared in a worse time for entrepreneurs in the area of focus and the time will show if the lowest temperatures that we experienced in August would give a multipotential extension."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, ascended to 2,7 per cent in July, reflecting the surplus in lancers of trade names.

Announcement of a Beast Advertising comparing mothers to goat divides online public opinion
A beast producer company has distributed online public opinions with an ad comparing mothers who nurture with cows who feed them.
In order to lanse the so-called "World's First Around and Portable Théâtre", consumer technology company Elvie streamed a humorist advertising inspired by video clips to demonstrate the freedom that it offers to breastfeeding mothers the new ocean
Quattro real mothers dance in a bulk of cows full of cows, with a song that includes texts like: "Yes, I'm shaking myself, but you can't see no cows" and "In case you've not seen it, they're not my cows."
"Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it to my girls."
However, the ad, which was posted on the page of the company on Facebook, has created a contradiction online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has come up with mixed reactions by the viewers, as many say they don't take seriously the " horror" of the milk industry.
"Very happy decision to use vacas to advertise this product.
"As we also, they must be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after birth," commented.
Elvie’s turbulence is differentiated in a suit breastfeeding (Elvie/Mama)
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise teasers for mothers who can hold their baby?"
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no
Others defended ads, while a woman admitted that her song seemed "exclusive".
"I think that's a very smart idea.
I'd like to buy a bastard like that if I'd still breastfeeding.
I've got to feel like a bow.
Advertising is a little lazy, but I didn't decide to overanalyse it.
"It's a smart product," wrote someone.
Somebody else commented: "It's a fun ad targeting moms pumping milk maternal (frequently in their workplace or toilets) and feel like "smiles".
"It's not a publicity that's arrogant or criticized the milk industry."
In the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all danced with distinctive teasers in their suithins.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump milk maternal with cistern say they feel like vacas.
Elvie cistern, however, is totally noise, does not have cables or tubes, and poses discreetly within a suit breastfeeding, allowing women to move, keep their babies and even come out during pumping.
Anna Balarin, co-partner and Executive Director of Creative at Mother, commented: "Elvie Taller is a product that is so revolutionary that it deserved a courageous and challenging launcher.
Having made a parallelismo between women who are breastfeeding and cattle who are breastfeeding, we wanted to concentrate the powder of mother milk and all the challenges that it contains, simultaneously showing a fun and relajant way new the incredible sensation of freedom that will be free.
It's not the first time Elvie toy becomes a first year.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the palace for fashion designer Marta Yakukovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants were transferred intact into camps near Texas border
The number of children under arrest of migrants has reached the height, although monthly border crossings remained relatively invariable, partially because the rigorous rhetoric and politics imprisoned by Trump administration have made it easier to match children's matching.
Traditionally, the majority of conservators are the same immigrants without travel documents and fear to go ahead and ask for a child to risk their ability to stay in the country.
The risk was incited in June, when federal authorities notified that potential conservators and other adults members of their household should give fingerprints and that data would be notified to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, senior officier de la immigration and telecommunication service, anoncéd a Congrese, decimals deputados invisibles, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados, deputados.
Later, the service confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had a white criminal registry.
"Almost 80 per cent of the people who are conservatives or members of the household of the conservatives are illegal in the country, and a great part of them are foreign criminals.
"We continue to pursue these people," said Mr. Albenz.
Inspiring for the rapid prosecution of children's cases, the officers have introduced new rules under which some of these children should appear in court within a month of their detention, and not within 60 days of their detention.
Mnogis will be manifested via virtualconference, in place of self-presentation, in order to develop their claims of legal status for jurisprudence jurisdiction in matters of migration.
Those who think that they are not satisfied with the conditions of exoneration will be immediately dismissed.
The more children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be stressed or to be depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or attempts of escape, according to workers in refugees and reports that have gone out of the system in recent months.
Adults said that these concerns were intensified to major installations, such as Tornio, where indices that a child is difficult is more likely to be noted due to the size of installations.
They added that moving the children to the scene without giving enough time to prepare the children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can aggravate the trauma with which they already fight.

Foreign money enters the most limited count for the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that 17th electoral region Pennsylvania in Congress accepta flow of money, thanks to the reconciliation of the electoral regions of Congress, instaurating two active members of Congress candidates for the same position.
This newly reorganized prehistoric region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Adjunct Connor Lab, who was elected in another region in special elections held last spring.
Lab, as an adversary, has another active representative, Republican Kith Ruthfus, who representes the ex 12th electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is largely aligned with the new 17th electoral region.
The maps were redistributed after a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which decreed in January that antikke regions were manipulated illegally in favor of Republicans.
The electoral numbering in the new 17th region of the election has fired a campaign of competition for financing between the major sectors for financing of the parties, the Commission of the Democratic Campaign for Congress (DCCC) and the Commission of the National Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lab became popular in Pennsylvania after he succeeded in a special election counting held in March for the 18th election district of Pennsylvania in Congress, which many people observed.

Bret Kavano's future is uncertain, since FBI starts investigations
"I thought that if we could really achieve something like what we wanted - a investigation of a long term and a object limited - we could have brought a little unity," said Mr. Felix Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be dissolved in amidst partial insolvency.
..porque Mr. Cavanos, ..hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe
Inconventionality is totally due to a temporary convergence.
Elections intermediaries are just in 5 weeks, 6 November, and if, as expected, Republicans are not going well, they will weaken considerably in terms of their efforts to achieve the election of the person they wished to be in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush calls Generals, pressing them to support Mr. Cavano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through this he met his wife Asley, who was the personal writer of Mr. Bush.
What's going on after the FBI's report?
Votations will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still not clear whether Mr. Cavano could obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Mike Pence, vicepresident, the chances of taking majority and confirming his appointment in the Supreme Court.
"North Korea's Destiny's Number falls under the power of Kim
"The number of posters from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un ascended to power 7 years ago, according to a lawyer from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, streaming data from South Korea's Ministry of Unity, claimed that 1.127 distances were observed last year, versus 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the rigoroses border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges of residents have become crucial factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
La majoritas distants from North Korea ultimately offer citizenship of South Korea.
Seul reports that more than 30.000 North Koreans have crossed illegally borders since the end of Korean War in 1953.
The majority of them flee through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross them than the severely protected Zona Militarized between North Korea and South Korea.
China considere immigrants illegale, despite migrants, and often deprime demons.
"Relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Later in a month, leaders of both countries meeting in Pyongyang to talk about negotiations on denuclearization, which have delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed with broad terms to cooperate for denuclearization of Korean Peninsula.
But Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Reim Jong Ill accused US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under these conditions, under no circumstances, we will not abandone our country unilaterally first", said Rim in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy calls Bret Kavano "hysterian", says it's inappropriate to serve in Supreme Court
President Democratic House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, nominated candidate for Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, "hysterial" and said it was inadequate to serve the Supreme Court.
Pelozie rushed these comments in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in East Texas.
"I couldn't just think that if a woman was conducted in this way, they would call her "hysteria", commented Pelozzi in relation to Kavano's statement before the Committee on Discrimination Affairs of the General Assembly on Thursday.
Kavano, entusiasmant, rejected accusations of having committed sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazie Ford, when both were teens.
Kavanaugh was deeply excited, and sometimes almost cried, and his voice we cried as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also convicted the Democrats in the committee, noting his accusations against him as a "terrorist and coordinated political killer" organized by liberals who were angry with the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozy affirme, he believes that Kavano's statement proved that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, since he proved that he is predominated against Democrats.
"I think that he separated himself with these statements and the way he succeeded against Clintons and Democrats."
Pelozi responded when asked if he would try to proteste against Kavano if his appointment was confirmed and if Democrats would gain majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't say the truth to Congress or FBI, then he's not only suitable for Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he's serving in this moment," she said.
Kavanaugh is jurisprudence in the District Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozi agreguó que como Democratica, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavano about the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) or the case of Roy vs. Wayne, as considered a conservative judge.
In the auditions on confirmation of his appointment, Kavanaugh refused to answer questions if he would allow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Isn't it time to go to court a hysterical man pre-inspired and wait to say, 'Isn't it awesome?'" she said.
Likewise, women must hold fast and hold fast and hold fast.
It's a reasonable breakthrough, months and years of anger shut down, and it can't get out of it without crying.
"We weep when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, you?"
"I'm really helping a woman who was ancestral somewhere, who said that she was crying when she was smoking, but she had developed a technique according to which, when she was smoking, and she started to cry, she said, "I'm crying, and she said, "I can't think that I'm arrogant because I'm arrogant."
"I'm angry."
So that's just going on.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Tears are allowed as a breakdown of anger in part, because they are basically suspended.
One of my most intense memories from a job I've done before, in a office where men dominated, is a time when I weep with anxiety anger, and a woman larger came from me - a cool directora I've always been scared - and a walked me to a walk.
"Never let's see them crying."
"Derefter, derefter, derefter, derefter, derefter, derefter.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they're breaking you."
Patricia Srender, then Democratic General of Colorado, had collaborated with Gary Hart in his campaign for presidency.

How the trade war between USA and China can make good in Beijing
The salutary homosexualities of the trade war between the US and China were exotic and while the battle still has much to finish, a crash between the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, the experts say.
President Donald Trump has launched the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exporting products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The largest climb evolved this week, imposing new tariffs to $200 million ($150 million) in essence, taxing half of all the products imported into the USA from China.
Beijing returns fires every time to species, while recently imposed taxes of 5-10 per cent to goods worth 60 million dollars.
China is determined to refunde America's fires and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to put it down soon.
"To make Washington retreat, it must confess their demands, but to worship publicly in USA would be excessively embarrassable for Shi Jinping, President of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing could play his papers correctly, the American pressures in the context of the War Commercial could have become positive for China a long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a critical policy decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic collapse in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than previously accepted by observers," Abbyil Green said.
