The great return of the Czech smoler is near.
Paul Francouz was called to the NHL
The Czech hockey broker Pavel Francouz, who has been through a heavy period of his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
A thirty-year-old kidney will be on a replacement, and soon it will also be able to get to the gate.
Former Lithuanian, Plzně, or Russian Čeljabinska was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Just in the middle of the Vegas race, he hasn't been present in the NHL from then on.
The incident occurred at a time when an experienced broker moved from one belt to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be outside for about three to four weeks with injuries in the lower part of the body," the Denver whole said in early October.
His return to the NHL gate was finally extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was called from a farm where he took four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, 94.5% of the interventions were recorded.
The deputy of Plenny hockey wants to end up and confirm that he belongs to one of the best leagues in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with the liver, and in the shortened pandemic he did not take away the only race.
In the NHL, "France" took 36 matches, its success of action was 92.3 percent.
Charles put Camille's shirt on Christmas wish, William and Kate posted in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their journey to Jordan as a Christmas wish.
His wishes were also published by Prince Charles, who used a photo on which Camille's going helps to put a rush in touch.
This was reported by the BBC on its website.
Wishes are sent to friends, co-workers and institutions with which they work.
Photographs were created in the desert countryside.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and has also princess Charlotte's dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has shirts and shirts as well as Prince George and Louis.
Who made the photo, William and Kate did not tell, is not even clear when it was created.
Last year, the royal family for photography intended as a Christmas Wish posted on a package of slams in front of a large wood in her rural settlement in Norfolk County.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by the follower of the throne of Prince Charles and his wife Camillo.
The photographer Sam Hussein captured him in June at contacts in Ascoth.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a dress on his face, helps Camille put her dress in a colorful suit with bright dresses.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the former Vice-President of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, had to have a promised million crowns from Prague to Slavia for a league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server of efotbal.cz that he got into part of the police records.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, chairman of the top club, said that no corruption negotiations were allowed to be red-white.
The server has published a resumption of police reports, in which Slavia figures mainly her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended in the summer at the master club.
A former influential functionary of the Red Whites was in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former athlete director of then secondary Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, which is also in the case among the accused.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro promised a financial reward for getting a title.
2019 SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authorities had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) would have to win in the league from the officials of SK Slavia Prague promised a million charge, cited the server from the record.
A day later, according to criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the President of the Presidency of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He refused any corruption proceedings.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the proportions of Czech football and offered an opponent alternative to its development.
"We never allowed an illegal negotiation, did not strive to influence arbitrators in violation of fair play rules, and we did not provide any financial implementation in this regard," Tvrdik for the List of Reports said.
Nezmar, among other things, does not oppose some former players of Slavia dark skin and also deceives his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of the alleged influence of the matches through arbitration dismissed police intervention in several places in mid-October last year, including the Prague headquarters of FAČR.
The most built in the appreciation is Berbr, who no longer fits in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, as was the former sports director Vyšehradu Rogoz was released from prison.
Rotulations, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
Works will be new, but in principle worse type (the shooters must be taken from the pancreatic cabin and wear handles manually without covering).
Cars - Toyoty hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various carriage vehicles - at the right level, in addition, it has already been possible to get rid of Prague V3S even in specialized units.
Airplanes: fighting- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short departure, but modern.
Drons - few and only small types without fighting potential
Missiles - we don't have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium-sized, cold-free, old; short reach - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I've got Honitbu right next to the city.
From the river they dropped nutrie and made harm to the fruit, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a bordel, so I sat calmly, and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before something happens, but of course, a little bit later.
I let her come at 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman barely crushed, had a headquarters on all sides, so I called on him that it was on a stick.
Before I got down from the seat, he was a fuss.
It's a man who's a man who's a man who's a man who's a man who's a man who's a man who's a man who's a man
On the other hand, it's not a war, it's supposed to be a surge of many accidents to make something happen, probably you'd be seen in the thermovision that I have today almost everybody.
So in a visible place, dear things put your legs into the bed and you should be in good mood.
Warriors vs. Hamac.
Respirators are significantly cheaper inside than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for purchasing and distributing shirts, masks and respirators for the nearest professions of the coronavirus, issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in recent weeks.
Server iRozhlas compared the purchases of the individual ministry and found that in one day the amounts of the respirator had differed to hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have been treated economically?
Why did other people buy a carriage?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to the editor of iRozhlas Dominica Kubishtova.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I am not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovakia made by the older generations), but the Czechoslovakia cannot benefit from the mandatory war.
We don’t even have large stocks of techniques that could be trained, we don’t even have modern techniques, nor for existing professionals, but the modern technique is increasingly complex, so the skill of the reservoirs will quickly be lost in time.
To this modern conventional conflict, where anyone can set up, will take place very quickly, there will be no time for someone to exercise again.
Finally, reserves/territorial defence are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where the mass geril is going, and it is also a expressed necessity to eliminate the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only be carried out in a conflict of such an extent and intensity, where the gerilla will be irrelevant, and we don’t even have adequate geography for that.
We don’t have an individual skill.
It's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them plays as if they had.
Then you're going to look like a frayer, who hasn't hit the empty gate 2 minutes ago, eats the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you're saying, "Tv and what do you think it's going to happen now?"
Of course, it is chosen as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill is so terrifying that I swear I am sincerely surprised to see that our attacker managed to beat one player of the competitor.
The first rainbow
Covid pandemic is slowing down, however, experts do not expect a significant return for the next few weeks.
The stress in hospitals according to statistical models lasts for a while and, as we know, a new unknown equation came into the pandemic: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the current Delta dominant.
At the same time, with absolute certainty, it is not possible to tell whether it can cause a more serious course, as much as vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous treatment of the disease.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the pluses also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new medication, antiviral molenupiravir, has arrived in Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by one-third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented with the medicine of paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports even 85% of the results.
However, the first supply of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of enlarging the portfolio of useful tools in combating the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the administration is prepared for the incoming medicines.
As stated, the first to receive Molnupiravir from Merck to domestic patients.
The company ended on the track as the first because the drug began to develop a long time before the current pandemic broke out in order to find the appropriate treatment for the virus disease of horses on the South American continent.
This research often reminds people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not share their opinions openly.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, and particularly we Czechs, are used to speak "as our pigs grew".
You will do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will say no.
In the West they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we are the Czechs racist.
And then they go and choose parties as AfD.
They are afraid of cancelling culture, saying this to the public means loss of work and media lynch.
Then it looks beautiful in the survey, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
It is only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both of which have more than 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three in the Czech Republic and are completely identical.
It is identical for the purpose of turning units so that the soldiers don’t have to learn where they are, so all the objects on the haircut are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the remaining two are abandoned.
It’s fun that the sssr didn’t want to have a nuclear header on its own territory, either because of the safety or speed of the landing of headers because of the western location.
In those underground covers (in each bar there are two) only heads were kept, not the entire missile as it is said.
If the gun was needed to be installed, a special unit received that picked up the head and installed it on some carriers.
In addition to the museum, the remains are in desolating condition.
At the second stage of the primary school, we had a co-learner of Cigan, we were with him for four years.
He was all right, he did good jokes, he often showed up so much, but that was our mask.
Everyone was playing with him, often walked and wanted to explain something, missed little, walked regularly, sported with us, didn't like chickens, nor phones, walked purely dressed.
He even traveled to schools in nature, worked in various spices, but he was fine, probably never a broker.
In the eighth or nineteenth grade, sisters, cigars, arrived in the same year, other grade.
Shortly after that, they killed the teacher, they often solved something there by the police, threatened and threatened the other students.
I personally sell something to advertisement (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I sold it to the Cigarettes often, money they have always had, did not try to get me to a price, communication in a quiet way.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called for a month that he had already written it on himself.
I say myself that I’m not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other as long as he behaves as he belongs to a decent society (works, works, women don’t kill, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, pushes his hand, breaks up the apartments and houses, has just an irregularity around him, makes trouble... so it doesn't matter what color he has, but I'm gonna miss.
I have no problem with African migrants if they join us, start business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be there.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prahatic
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite her rehabilitation care, unfortunately she suffered from her injuries on the ground," said Zuzana Fajtl, spokeswoman of South Korean healthcare officers.
The accident probably blamed a driver who took the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot car probably went in the direction of the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unidentified reasons, went into the contra-direction.
After the rain, the Peugeot vehicle was over on a roof outside of the car, spokesman of the Southern police Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injury in an accident.
It was a number of injuries and remained in the car.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and in a stable state he was flying to the Czechospital, the rescue officer Fajtlová noted.
She added that the man from the second car suffered mild breast injury and was transferred to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
It is mainly collector cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, let’s say more than ten dollars, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free,” the collector said.
Since October, the order of small shipments has been slightly disturbed, the VAT and the post must be added to the customs proceedings.
He will receive an email with a message that the customs authorities are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is sufficient to fill in the shipping data, and if the trader has no longer included VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount of shipping and shipping.
In the event that the recipient does not provide customs control itself, the compensation of the carrier must also be included in the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisls, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two cutting boxes, I'll insert two annexs and I'm ready.
For me, it’s usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
Not all the shippings can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the number of shipments received from abroad has decreased daily in the international post in Prague from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the challenges of submitting the data necessary to complete the customs proceedings.
There are currently 30,000 shippings that we need to process.
If people would fill in all the information needed and fill them in time, we would be around half here, says the spokesman of the Czech Post, Matthias Vitík.
Inflation Solutions
See the title, how would you propose solutions to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and its further growth is expected.
What should you do to slow this growth, or to compensate for it?
Do we see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where it gets fast?
Prices rise faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to allow ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is an employee)?
They added 2% to me in gross this year, which is a laughter, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I operate in employment.
Would anyone be able to explain why proving the penalty of violence is sent to the net for only six months?
This head doesn't just tell me how the court can send such an animal out of the net for six months just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships in general.
And that's not to mention that the victim of rape never remembers it again.
Will this and the potential future report of the rape of the victims not be deceived?
The grave’s man “propelled” his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the grave unwillingly helped the guards to ensure his nationally searched girlfriend from Kostomlat, whose arrest order was issued.
He called them to her alone.
But he went on it.
He first turned around and invented the story that he was stolen.
The guards came to the place after calling the tiny line, and did not wonder when the alleged "theft" told them that he had invented everything to bring the guards to the place.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers on how to submit a notification to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found that the woman was on the list of people looking for, in a national search, and a detention order was issued on it.
This is why the PRC addresses the case.
The honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slovak?
I personally believe that we are not solemnly ethnic or culturally solemn for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Unlike meme, of course, I agree that Churchill was unable to ensure the liberation of the U.S. Prague :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slovak language.
Well, I don’t know, the question is whether a rational person can actually trust something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case as a true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world, if not, about ten thousand different religions.
What god or god should a person choose?
I would say that it is totally likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will constantly punish you if you believe in another god.
In the tenth, however, there is no other god except the LORD.
Wouldn’t it be more reasonable, then, to remain faithful to any god than to risk the wrong choice of those thousands of gods, and that one true god I’ve just failed will send me to hell for it or to a similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the leadership of professionals with practical experience.
If you're doing well, you can get a professional offer.
All of the ACP components would have happened.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the educational sector and the industry is constantly increasing, companies hunt at schools and some sort of migration is taking place when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only when you are adolescent, but this process is constantly taking place, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one industry to another, etc.
Similar settlements should work between civil and military sectors.
I also perceive it as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, that is, an institution that guarantees that there will never be a Russian, German, or a Mongolian traveller.
I think it's funny how you think NATO's something crushed into the stone, we have ally and they'll protect us if there's a break.
Well, you're enjoying the pan.
Only one election in the U.S. will round their budget and the entire NATO will be drinking.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Polish will once show them enough to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing he has long served as a guarantee of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military technique of his time.
And today he can pilot the remotely controlled resources of every teenager, so it wouldn't work.
We don't need a cross-border confirmation, that's today, but a tiny teenager behind a remote-controlled device will be advised.
How to get rid of a box tsunami
Do you pack gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home with boiling boxes and fillings?
This waste is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of stores that your used boxes welcome.
Not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed so that they can endure repeated manipulation.
This is why it is harmful to treat them as one-time waste.
Anyone may, after the agreement, bring to the engaged store (KAMsNIM.cz project map contains less than 150) carton boxes, plastic or paper filling.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packages that are currently in the market, as well as saving money, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically thoughtful customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One of these stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugs and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and filling materials are driven by individuals who gather at home, but we are also called companies with which we have contracted regular collections of deposited cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more respectful world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to the next generations, says Petra Lopušnik from Tierry.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz app not only shows the locations on the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take the cut-off waste from home, where to deliver past medicines, tyres, deserving electricity, batteries, light sources, wholesale waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
A total of the project maps already contain over 100 000 such places.
“It gradually adds collection halls, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity stores, SWAPs and other places that help to find the use of things that would otherwise unnecessaryly become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubasek, one of the authors of the U.
I’m worried that today the technique is so simple and foolish that children who use a computer or a phone are playing games on it, but they don’t learn basic computer skills.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps on photos or mobile phones generally simply hide the underlying file system with folders and all will be placed on a single screen in the app.
Let them use the technique since childhood, but especially let them learn something.
Let's overwrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron introduced the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU – beginning in January – and it was great.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he revealed the logo of the Presidency, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not reach within six months.
French politicians like it, but they also like it.
Macron’s supporters of the split between the right and the left agree on a small, but right in Europe yes.
In France there will be new elections for heads of state in April.
The election calendar has also influenced its priorities.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such a work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately contributed to Macron’s criticism of pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, he is trying to defend the overwriting of history.
The national right-wing candidate to the French president Éric Zemmour is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which cooperated with Hitler in the Second World War, was not so bad and has a lot of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history book seriously and don't look at the event in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn the history as a story against them and never as a whole.
The Spanish, French, Czech, find out who has defeated in any battle.
But if they don’t have an enlightened office, they won’t know what was the wider context of the event.
What's the movie of the year, Aida?
The Czech mouse didn't win.
The story, returning to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won the awards for the director and best actress Jasna Duričić.
At the Carlovar festival this year, he held on the first corners of the audience.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for Dad's film.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having influenza/being unsafe" a couple of days I had a diarrhea and had no taste of smoking...
It was worse than normal influenza.
I have no diarrhoea in flu.
(Only personal experience. I don't claim that everyone has that)

The author in his last novel tells about a rather less sentimental story about the return of emigration than we used to listen.
Those who remain, and those who have gone, know too little about themselves to give it to a common life.
Trains start driving according to the new schedule, somewhere transporters change
From Sunday, trains are starting to ride on the rail according to the new schedule.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on certain routes, for example between Austem nad Labem and Kolín, where the Czech Republic is starting to drive RegioJet instead.
For most lines, only the time of departure is adjusted, and, if possible, their routes.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the trains.
The sale of tickets started in the autumn.
The Czech routes plan to make an average of 6783 passenger transport connections a day, of which an average of 478 distance trains a day.
Trains will run around 118 million kilometers during the new schedule.
The roads alongside national connections within the new schedule will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new schedule, set up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains that will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will travel to northern Morava or western Czech Republic.
Transporters will also traditionally increase the price of the road from next year, by an average of 3.2%.
Others take into account inflation at their rates every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet schedule is the entry to R23 Ústí nad Labem – Malník – Nymburk – Cologne.
Transporters here, after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, will replace the Czech Road.
Each day, RegioJet will carry a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to the remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped on Sunday in the stations of Havlíčkov Brod, Zhdar nad Sazava and Kolín.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two backlinks to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokeswoman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier has tried to maintain the most similar times of its distance trains despite the planned exclusion work.
Without any major changes, Arrivy trains and other carriers should continue.
Transporters are also exchanged in some regional trails.
Changes are waiting for passengers, for example, to the Czechoslovakia, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will be driven on the trail from Mladé Boleslavi through Czech Libya to Romania instead of the Czechoslovakia.
Travellers will also be able to take advantage of a single railroad trip next year.
As with Czech prices, their price will rise by inflation 3.2%.
I have to disagree.
Will we not be able to look at the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, and they had to cry, they died.
In my life I haven't heard teaching from the perspective of the slavery party or from then on, no one keeps it, just condemns it.
No one will tell you at school that blacks often sold themselves to slavery blacks and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that colonists often purchased land from Indians, everywhere they will tell you how brutal we, Europeans, have murdered each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, right at schools, both in the northern schools and in the Southern.
I haven’t met anyone who deliberately waste the facts, but I’ve heard before that it’s happening, and I think it’s a problem, I don’t deny it (the need for animals from WW2 in Japan is quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s perspective, without understanding.
History doesn’t care about someone’s feelings, it’s just what it’s, and I think it’s a fatal mistake to condemn regardless of the matter from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we are already in those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes, and it came to me absurd to reject them.
In addition, the North was not much better than enough people idealize it today.
And many people also forget that not all in the South were slaves and lots of things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn’t compare this with the Russians, deliberately leave some facts, lies and manipulate them, in addition, we don’t have our views with them (there was a video from the TV where someone started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What happened to me at U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and idealization of Communism, something that their land never experienced.
In general, I found that it was terrifying at some universities, that students were quite betrayal, and that schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be a lot older once, I'm a bit bad about the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has long achieved what he had, and it is no longer about the same, that he has betrayed himself.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, lead to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even in fairly reasonable things.
The more someone is radical, the more they hear him.
In any case, I haven’t met anyone who condemns me for colonialism or slavery.
I met a bad geography, but it was both-sided :D
Not because I wouldn't like it here, but because I think it's totally meaningless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality in general to be inadequate from the point of view of a personal identity.
If something with people eats me such interests, looks at the world and common experiences, not the place we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek-Catholic farms here, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovenian.
He is a very good man, he has the preaching of theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks a coconut about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, here is the Church of Czechoslovakia Hussein.
They are officially Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic moderns and are actually Catholics without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the Hussein worship because it is very theologically similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functional temple on the street of Botanical.
Otherwise, St. Michael’s church on the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00, they work in Latin as they did before the Vatican II.
Betleem Plain is in the Czech Republic, Scouts have taken it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame that was planted in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scout for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but not even this time, was taken to Vienna by his Austrian colleagues in the morning at the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav.
It was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate each year with the department, and I look forward to it.
It is a honour for me that I was chosen, she told the present reporters of the skuut Amalia Budikova.
While last year, the transfer took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, right on the border bridge, now at the crossing of Reintal – Břeclav on the parking lot.
He usually travels by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the transportation of flames through the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem’s light, the skies were traditionally moved by train to Brno, where they transferred it to the diecean bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, the next light will be deployed by Scout-surfers who will travel with selected speeds and passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken to the stations of local skateboarders or volunteers who will then continue to spread the flames throughout the Czech Republic and where the trains do not go.
Even this year, it is necessary to comply with the applicable measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going on like last year.
We recommend both those curriculum teams and local events organizers to wear shirts of course, to try to follow the disputes, were they as little as possible, not singing colleagues, simply behaving so as to be as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem light, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread with the flame of the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for the believers, the light that overcomes the darkness.
For more than 30 years, the Czech Republic has been working on its spread.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of integrity and human mutuality.

I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecosystems (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education are in good use of these funds, and I just don’t understand why these funds are put into agriculture, industry, and companies in general.
As mentioned, an unnecessary product is produced and it is filled with a free market and a "natural life of the company".
I’m working in a fabric where there is a million outfits “xy financed/co-financed by a xy project” on the walks, and such a company is merely artificially kept in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to people, this is the breakthrough of the development that this company holds and hinders contracts/employed companies that could grow and become more productive after its destruction.
Absolute consent, it's awful.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet will also be smart in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I think that internet advertisements aren’t with me, but then I’m still surprised that they’ve influenced me – it’s just so exhausted that people don’t always stop it.
I also support radical votes in the European Parliament, which currently want to give a complete ban on programming (= targeted) advertising.
It's all the funeral, the classical words - I'd forbid the internet.
I feel like this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
"I don't believe in something that the majority believes and give it meaning, I'm not sheep, but I'd rather believe in something that is less likely, it doesn't give meaning, but it's important that I'll have my own original opinion that I'll claim is critical thinking."

TVs have missed the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere has two hundred this year
Los Angeles – China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have missed the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will be recorded to their audiences in the premiere.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years in the audience has scored and significantly increased follow-up, so these images are increasingly growing.
This year there were four times more Christmas movies than in 2011 and twice as much as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only the images that have the word Christmas in its name, so it will actually be a lot more holiday movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is particularly associated with stories, and world-wide are also popular as pictures of Self Home, Love Heavenly or Classical Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas pictures started until in 2009, when a special film series came up with the U.S. cable TV station Hallmark, the BBC said.
Her advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station started to celebrate its visitors on the Christmas Day on October 22 and presents a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new films with Christmas theme and also contributes to the total of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
"In this magical period of history again, it is important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and they are snowing," Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, wrote.
“For audiences, it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm in the midst of all the celebration and crazyness of the world we live in the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is still uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be about half an hour before the end of a misunderstanding that apparently will solve and you two will kiss.
This is how it is always around, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, Grey adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on COVID-19, which will not intervene until the final F1 race.
At the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi, only nineteen riders will be held in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on COVID-19 and will not intervene until the last season race.
Haas will just get one formula on the line.
In the last race of the season, he had to attack a better position from the 20th wheel he was qualified.
Russian Nikita Mazepin from the stake Haas will eventually not strike to the Grand Prix of Abu Zabi.
He was positively tested for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the start-up track, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, the first Max Verstappen in direct battle with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is relatively okay according to the statement of the Haas and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will be followed by the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, while security will be the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," the representatives for formula1.com said.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, and he can't.
Any substitute should have been qualified or driving in another part of the weekend.
Covide-19 is not the first racer.
At the start of the late season, covid-19 was Kimi Räikkönen, and Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were positively tested last year.

Hygiene checks another child's case from Adam.
“We are currently reporting further suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam’s preparation class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the country a week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases," the National Influenza Reference Laboratory and the non-Influenza Virus of the State Institute of Health in Prague said.
She added that it was two nurses from one workplace of the Brno Faculty Hospital and two children from one, and two eleven-year-old ZŠ Adamov students.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adam.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four signless courses.
Nobody with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad
No one of these traveled abroad, nor any of their families, nor had any contact with anyone who would live abroad.

California restricts the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas when abortion bans.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of some weapons in the United States by means of a legal mechanism that used Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after detection of the embryo’s heart attack.
People should then be entitled to compensation in case of a complaint with anyone who produces or sells assault gun and home-made firearms in California.
Newsoma responded to the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in force, to be contrary to the 50-year-old precedent dictate that laid down the right to abortion across the U.S. by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has now decided not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measures.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, allowing the Republicans of Texas to prevent the attack by the usual judicial means.
“I am overwhelmed by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court yesterday, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the Texas manicure to protect its law,” the California Governor said.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” Newsom said.
According to his subordinates, he ordered, in cooperation with the State parliament and the Minister of Justice, to work on measures that would appeal to the representative of the public to enforce the prohibition of attacking guns and so-called weaponry.
These are marked as a home-made weapon that does not have serial numbers and that can serve to avoid regulations.
Newsom wants the “private citizens” to require at least $10,000 compensation (over 220,000 CZK) and judicial expenditure from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell attack guns, parts in “spiritual weapons” or sets for their production.
“If in the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons outside our streets, creating a threat to private complaints, we should do exactly that,” the California governor said.
AP reports that California has for decades banned the production and sale of some army-style weapons, but in June the federal judge blocked the ban as anti-constitutional.
If the State would now actually restore the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of the liberal members of the Supreme Court, Soni Sotomayor, who, in a disagreement opinion on the Friday majority dictatorship, warned from the enlargement of the legal mechanism to other States of America.
However, the Supreme Court did not recognize the Texas abortion ban complete immunity against the judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to proceed with complaints against the selected Southern State agent.
Each emergency vaccine has its own public test phase, where it gradually comes to see how the vaccine scheme will look and also improves the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
Perhaps from Israel, there is already a large selection of 4 dose effects studies.
And according to these studies, the majority of patients have a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect for you.
Just like any other vaccination will have its vaccination scheme over time, it’s just too early to do so.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should be placed on the market shortly, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater efficiency.

Poland threatens to stop payments in the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act in violation of the law if it exercised new powers and, due to a dispute on the rule of law, it stopped paying money to Poland.
The Commission has already delayed the approval of the Polish plan for the withdrawal of EUR 36 billion from the EU Fund for the restoration of the economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is under the pressure of the European Parliament to further implement and use a mechanism to remove EU grants to countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to the EU's discharge with water in all matters that require unanimity," Ziobro, head of the small party Solidarity Poland, without the current government's votes, said.
"Poland should also consider its commitments to EU energy and climate policy, leading to a drastically rise in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will ask Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified in the fact that the EU illegally withdraws our funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, has added the Polish Minister.
His party in the EU approach takes more radical positions than the governing party in Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, changes made by Polish justice under Ziobrov threaten its independence and submit it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, establishes “impossible conditions because its purpose is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw faces a “political dictatorship carried out by printing and an attempt to support a democratic decision of millions of Polish,” Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of a EU based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never come into such delays in Brussels, which would be a consequence of limited sovereignty of Poland.
“We will never agree to have Poland as a colony,” he said.

When I was a child, I was punished with a cooker.
It was never because of signs, mostly it was just that I refused to listen and angry again (I read instead of going to sleep, washed with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without a warning, my mom always threatened that if I did it again, I would get hurt (sometimes even after another "delay" I just brought the cook and put it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my back (free clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in a reasonable manner and extent) are beneficial because the child responds to them much more than words.
I think that part is important with a warning because it gives the child in his own way to choose whether he will not listen and get or better and will not be punished.
In the end, most of the warnings were enough to start listening to me.
Defence of the system
When the important Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtek Cepl responded to a press question in 1999, what the Czech Constitution means for him – whether the sacred charter on which he swears and which he has been taught at school, or on the contrary, the first agreement that can be amended if necessary, he is appealing.
We once agreed in the Constitution to the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and save them better with changes.
And imagine: some people even like their rules.
As the Czechs like pigs and cheese, he then voted on the question of Vojtěch Cepl.
However, lawyers have seen more and more recently that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs change.
The summers are tested by situations that her creators (which the Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example, by behaviour of the elected president.
But in one thing, Cep was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be reflected.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to managing most of the crises that society faces throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule of governance consisting of individual rules that lay down the rules of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that it will be greatly abused against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid does not choose, fighting for the life of a monthly baby in FN Brno
Although it is known that the coronavirus is more mild to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have faced most recently.
“We know that children are threatened and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Peter Dominik, Prime Minister of Children’s Aesthetics Clinic and Resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital of Brno and the Faculty of Medical School of Masarykov University.
The flow is substantially simpler, lighter, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are children who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period,” Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need slight support.
It takes place in children's infectious disease clinics.
Very seriously sick children with coronavir have been at ARU just recently.
Children with post-covid syndrome were constantly attended by the doctor throughout the year.
“Now it is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, lung inflammation, which requires stay in a resuscitative bed,” he said, and added that this disease affects adults, both teens and a few months’ baby.
Children in hospitals are also in a severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“Now we have a child of several months and a teenager,” said the prime minister.
However, it is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded in the FN Brno Children’s Hospital.
According to available data, six children aged between 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominica, in a child hospital, not only in the coronavirus department, is an integral part of the collaboration of a psychologist.
At the same time, it notes that, as in adults and children, vaccination relieves the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovid syndrome.
“This is why we recommend the vaccination dose in children,” the doctor added.
You can walk in a quiet area only on the designated roads.
But the calm zones are not so big.
They are viewed on the tourist map on the maps.com.
Generally, in national parks outside the tranquil zone you can walk anywhere (but don’t walk through the plot into the area).
Skiing/biking bicycles in the forest outside of the labeled road should not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it does not take too much care of outside the national parks).

China is building an impression of controlled infections and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Jirouš: China is building an impression of managed infections and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has come to health and political offensives.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to stop the infection that has become a global pandemic.
The country now reports zero growth of infected people.
Countries including the Czech Republic are fighting for Chinese protective aid and many Chinese doctors are helping in fighting coronavirus, for example in the worst disabled Italy.
How do you feel the will of Beijing?
Is it a friendly support or is the Communist regime trying to improve your image in the world?
A friend of a friend meets and says to him, "Hey, you don't want an éléphant?"
I have it and it's great.
The husband loves because he saves herbs, cars to wash, children play with him.
Well, it's just perfect.
If you want for 5,000, I'll sell the elephant to you.
My friend, I'm going to do it, it's going to be perfect...
After a while, they meet and the one who bought complains: what did you sell it for an elephant????
The kidnapper, a huge bull everywhere, the car sat down, the children fear him, and his wife wants to divorce.
The one who sold said: "You're not talking about the dictionary, you're not talking about the dictionary like that."
The world is controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, they are the same powers that determine the course of the international event.
Europe can stand with such power only if it will work on its integration.
So far it works at the economic and political level (in selected matters), but still lacks military integration.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will take place.
I thought it was too, and it was quite possible.
I'm not a Czech expert, so maybe I'm talking.
I’m just based on the fact that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I borrow an example from another commentary of "Spanish oranges and mandarins", when it is clear that it is both from Spain, but for "Spanish fruits and mandarins" is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I believe that the phrase sounds like "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect this to be already included in this broad concept and there is no need to further specify it in the U.S. forces.
But again, I'm just talking about :D
Whether it’s what or what it’s, it’s an unfair requirement.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured Milly's hair cock
The horrific pictures show the moment when the scared potato crashed into the bathroom before her senseless owner screamed and laughed at her.
Holland’s apple also fed bottles, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrate Court now bans her to lively farming, The Sun reported.
Experts in the rehabilitation of pigs, who care about Milly after her kidnapping, have stated that they have never seen such a frightened spaceman before.
Milly spent nearly two years of rehabilitation at Monkey World employees in Dorset and is now happy to play with another rescued popkin named Moon again.
The four-time mother admitted two charges of unnecessary suffering to the protected animal.
A 12-week punishment for the withdrawal of freedom was imposed in the court of Gwent with a conditional delay for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lively ban on animal farming and must pay a recalculation of 12 000 crowns of judicial costs.
Steph Sawyer, the head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the animals, said: “Milly is okay, but rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She cried and hid from anyone she met, and any sound or sudden movement caused her to cry.
She refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she is sitting and satisfied with a man, her look at new people can still cause panic.
Psychic jewelry will be carried out forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's kidnapping appeared after the Gwent police discovered a terrible shot in a woman's phone after she was in her apartment for drug charges.
On the recordings, you can hear what Milly says vulgarly.
On the next video, you can hear the Dutch bite offering cocaine and say, “Do you want cocaine?”
So, look at my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine was found for 1600 pounds (in a recalculation of less than 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a conditional punishment of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts do you learn from this ancient age three times after yourself when you bravely cross the entire 20th century?
How do you take the same things in the first place as in the sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of biffling, when no one, the honor of exceptions, doesn't matter whether you know or understand.
First of all, write a test for 1 and then no one else cares about it.
Run and on the street, randomly ask people whether to be able to determine the character of the square equation roots and coefficients.
All of them have gone through it, and the absolute majority are not even unrestrained, and they will tell you that they're completely in a pizza.
So what the hell is that learning about?
I am a great fan of a general overview and the fact is that people don’t want and don’t need it.
And at that moment it's unnecessary and you'll never get it into them.
This is partly learned for a lot of people who will need a thing.
But like, this note that you don't really need all of this to stand at the machine, I thought it was really serious because you just don't need it.
In addition, we get slowly to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which our communist past and anger against educators and elites is likely to be involved in us) However, the price of being barbarians in these machines is simply high.
If the journalists were able to count, Covid probably never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at first glance: The War of Kadri and Andrey continues!
This is the main reason why Switzerland can’t leave it right away,” Andrea answered on Instagram to all the questions of fans in Kadrim so disappointed her that she decided to stop all contact and even block it on social media.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, it has been a burden since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, i.e. at least until she returned to the Czech Republic.
But she rejected it decisively.
And as you can see, their relationship has not only ended with love, but rather has grown into mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was enraged by Kadri in response to Andre's lies, gambling and debt charges.
The alleged honesty of Kadri was no longer liked by his ex-wife, even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stop her brother publicly.
Normally I don’t express myself in such a way, and even in the family, we have never spoken too much of these things.
I really don't want to excuse some regret.
But if I see someone who is trying to hurt publicly and spit the name of someone I love so much, it simply doesn't give me!
I'm sorry that I have to do this on this road, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making herself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, even when he was young.
I'm more sorry about this when I have to read this false information that is probably quite out of context.
I would like to know everyone Kadri as I, our relatives and family, stand in confession in response to the words of Andrey.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the fact and we know how it really was, added incertainly.
A drunk thief jumped through the facade to the fifth floor.
You can't believe why.
Cchao started his stealing trip at a parking lot in the residential neighbourhood, where he tried to enter a few cars.
According to the available information, he finally cut off from one vehicle in a recalculation of less than 330 crowns.
Then there was nothing better than going up to the 5th floor and entering the apartment with the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
On the recording of one security camera, it is then captured as it leaves the street away from the place of the offence, while eating a banana.
When the owner woke up in the morning, he found that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then arrested Ccha.
He admitted that he was drinking some alcohol in the day of the crime.
And since he needed money, he decided to get drunk.
The whole thing is still in investigation.
The opilec broke the fascist up to 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and effectively associated with pandemic emergency.
When it is cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business
Isn't that enough for you as a reason?
The right to collect will be restricted, but never cancelled.
More than 60 percent of voters arrived in four municipal elections on Saturday.
The new representatives voted on Saturday in the municipalities of Komnja in Uherskohradiszka, Lužice in Mostecka, Nová Ves in Liberecka and Rovné in Pelhřimovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities decreased by law or the number of elected representatives here declined.
A total of 28 candidates were eligible for 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes for us a relatively challenging but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections were held in general representatives and, above all, highly observed elections in the House of Ambassadors, said Vice-President Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, choices were more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
In Komni in Hungary, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday elections, won 27.76 percent of votes and two mandates in a seven-member representation.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the gain of two mandate.
Two chairs in the representation were won by Citizens for the Commonwealth, giving them their vote of 18.52 percent.
They were once again represented by the former mayor of the municipality Johan Krzyžková, who is a member of the Privates.
One mandate in the representation was achieved by the Communist – independent candidates.
There were 75.48 percent of the eligibility voters.
In the municipality of Equality on Pelhrymovska, the Association for Equality won.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates from seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have been included in the General Representation.
Elections were 93.62 percent.
Repeated elections in Lužica on Mostec were once again won by the Association of Lužica and Svinčica led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the votes and, as in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member representation.
The second end of the candidate for the people, who voted 43.27 percent of the voters, will have three representatives in the representation.
76.7% of the voters arrived.
The elections in New People in Liberia won independent candidates for New Ves before the ANO Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of the voters voted and thus won four positions in the seven-seventh general representation.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against the correct elections in 2018, won more mandate and has three.
The election was 42.9% of the voters.
The election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the collection of laws.
What do you think there would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think all that people here know you know well.
You're just playing a fool to have someone to fight with.
If not, it's sad.
I do not say that Christians are degenerate or anything like that.
I even like many church buildings from aesthetic perspective (which ultimately was the goal to look good).
I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I don’t care how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money she earned, how much science she repressed, etc.
Not all of the wars that caused, such as the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe yourself in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church do not have anything to do together.
The man fell down with his head from twelve meters.
The attack on concrete survived.
The incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, where the rescue officers of the country's health rescue service were involved.
The employees of the country’s operation center took an hour after Saturday midnight a call with the original information about the crash of a man from the height.
Two U.S. crews, medical and medical, immediately went to the place.
After arrival, the healthcare providers found that a seventy-seven-year-old man had to fall from the window at a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
Carbon in Vitkovics.
But not as it should be, but the hackers went to the action.
At the moment of the arrival of rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct life threats.
The attacking physician intubated his respiratory pathways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after other measures in pre-hospital immediate care, the sanitary vehicle transported him to further care of the ostrava traumatology center, said the spokesman of the UAE MS kraje, Lukáš Humpl.
I am worried more about coronavirus than about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first place it costs mostly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
The UFC 269 tournament took place.
Outsider Julianna Penny has been able to defeat the legendary match Amandu Nunes, who has not found the overseer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not swallow in a light weight, introduced great cuts against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly struck Cody Garbrandt with the technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated his opponent Sean O'Malley.
Surprise that no one expected.
This brought a woman's bantam weighing match between Amando Nunes and Julian Penny.
The American went into mutual battles as an intentional “trapslick,” because Nunes did not lose for seven years and broke the teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the journey with the victory very actively and the opponent even defeated the push kick that sent her to the country.
However, the money didn’t make any other mistakes, and she failed to attempt to attack herself using a handbag.
The second wheel was sturdy and very stressful for MMA fans.
Both competitors honored a lot of excellent hits and hard hacks.
In addition, the money got Nunes to the ground where she began to cut it.
He had to give up and unlock the attack.
The Americans made a huge shock to everyone when they became a new champion.
At the top of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poirier for a title in light weight.
Initially, it was better to Poirier, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who attempted to strike the rifle on his hand.
He failed to do so, but then he created a great pressure, got a rival on his back and wounded him with a number of wounds.
Thanks to the second round he won.
In the third round, Oliveira showed rear naked shocks, which Poirier had a moment of disturbance, but then had to cut off.
The Brazilian defended the title, and Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, he joined the sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who already placed on Raulian Pai's hard right back in the first round.
He then received a number of precisely measured hits and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to consult Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she lost after seven years.
The kidney or the kidney?
At first glance, it’s not complicated.
Most important names in Czech are expressed only one grammar race, and there is no problem for them to determine whether it is a male, female or medium-sized race.
Then there is also a relatively number of substantial names for which the race is not established.
Such substantial names climb between two breeds.
Dual ends are then acquired when sliding and, in some cases, remain in a disproportionate form.
For example, the words “switch” or “switch” are the race of male and female, in the first they are depicted according to the pattern of “instrument”, in the second according to the pattern of “song”.
For other categories of substantial names, different forms are already in the first fall of the unit number, such as: “range/range”, “kedluben/kedlubna” or “brambor/brambora” (in the meaning of food).
Both forms are written, have the same significance, and therefore are freely replaceable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example, in the Czech Republic and in the Morav, but in this case the Morav variant is unwritten, similar to the other Czech- Morav couples are the words: “good” and “good”, “good” and “good” etc.
Some words that penetrated in Czech from other languages were originally irrevocable, but gradually take over the Czech ends.
A typical example is the term "image" which is the race of male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle gender, but in the male has ends according to the pattern of "class".
Turkey has opened a road for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation look directly at the Greek borders?
At the Greek-Turkish border there is tension due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to release to the southern borders of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, and humanitarian aid is also provided by the Czech government.

We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we're breathing, a Sydney journalist describes.
The devastating fires that Australia has faced for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of soil.
How do the local authorities and residents themselves deal with the penalty?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government do more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics say?
What will the country need to prepare for the future in terms of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
Fake accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That’s why it’s always written about everybody everywhere.
For people it is unpleasant to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how much it is widespread, so it is attempting to ban.
I don't know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have experienced how people often behave around them or even police.
Victims should always be trusted.
It is a trend that the victims are finally open to their traumas.
But it still leaves a lot of people for themselves.
They will also find those who accuse someone falsely.
It's a noise and swimming in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the thought that "a large part of the accusation is thoughtful" and that it's a "trend" that only helps sexual violence.
Czechs flood houses, families don’t have money to finish
Construction materials prices have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people have come into a dirty situation.
He does not have any funds for completion of dismantled family homes and banks refuse to raise hypothetical loans.
In addition to the prices of material, the price of construction works also increases.
Therefore, people don’t have enough money to finish their homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise hypothetical loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to displaced and unchecked homes.
In the worst case, the displaced houses are residential and the families are forced to sell them because they can't afford to pay the mortgage and still pay for rent," says the BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses in a year, and about fifty percent did it.
For us as a construction company, it’s hard to keep some things contractually, even if the material has reflected.
So we do without profits,” said the owner of the construction company Zdenek Slivoň.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they counted that the building of the house would go for five million, then it's now going to cost seven.
I think some will wait,” Slivony added.
Of the material, it was most stimulated by copper, iron, as well as installation and topper equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a lack of workforce.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of stairs are missing and the flow of foreign workers is braking the pandemic.
At this time, only the situation in terms of building permits is favourable.
“In October, the building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10% more than a year ago,” Křeče said.
We'll be fine and we'll be even better.
Real vision is missing, says the commentator Black – mujRozhlas
The entry into the new year, in addition to the classical celebrations, has traditionally been conducted by politicians.
This year, other than the Prime Minister and President Andreje Babishe and the Christmas message of President Miloše Zeman and the President of the Senate and the House of Ambassadors were spoken to the nation.
What have we learned essentially?
As it comes to me with a super diploma right now, I have my own theme I have chosen, I have a bachelorship, I always work on it all year round, and then in a week to two write a written part.
They are completely calm with us, if a man isn't a total makeup and something has left him in that head, so the commission will not necessarily suck him in the theory.
I may have been studying a week in the state, and when I was in the end, the Commission always tried to bring me to some logical departure that I immediately got up and I had it right.
Unlike those projects, I know people who pay someone to make the semester project for them (we have done it many times, really profitable, very much learning) and then only learn the project and are exhibited.
I think it’s great when at the end of the subject there’s an exam to which the knowledge acquired within the project is overwhelmed, not just defense.
But don't pay for emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're going to be the same puppy as they.
Those people in the embassy may have nothing to do with that.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But quietly, you can build a similar to Putin's bear's socket next to the Pú bear's socket.
Maybe you'll still give it to Xi Jinping on your back or something.
I agree, even though Insta puts artists under foot.
Once you don’t make stories every day and at least every other day a new image, your achievements will be reduced to the minimum.
Furt also changes what is more important for the function if a lake, a comment or a storage.
It's terrible for me in the last few days, so maybe I'm going to have to go down to the tikko, where many artists in my industry have success and they're almost not allowed to do it.
Finally, I might even wish if there was something user-friendly that wouldn’t expect from artists with all creativity and energy.
Statement of the Parties working on Donbase
The union – yes, breaking – no, expresses in the picture its view of the opponents of the Soviet breaking.
Thirty years since the unlawful breakdown of the Soviet Union.
In December 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in the history of humanity occurred.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, without any legal powers and infringement of the results of the referendum dated 17 March 1991, with an open-minded position of Michail S. Gorbač, secretly, regardless of the entity, the SR exists as an international entity, "signate the rights, and realitate the agreement,
One cut of a pen has "abolished" a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
During the fall of the Soviet Union, dozens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens have landed abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the Russian population has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Even regardless of the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even before, the same people who destroyed what was built in the last seventy years in one session in the Beloved Falls have transformed a socialist camp (created at the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and in the Great Patriot War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, disturbed agriculture, removed from the world's largest power of fourteen republics, which had previously been economically unified in one mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the loss of the population, the breakdown of the economy, the science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Czech Republic, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of Orange Revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the eastern, the expansion of the socialist revolutions, the war of the Gouvernemental Revolution, the Gou.
There is such a concept in politics as “vacuum of power”.
All that was quickly betrayed and abandoned, quickly filled and gained NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitalization.
And so far, the whole world is worried mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a large-scale supermarket must not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It’s Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it on Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality in which I don't buy that meat on Monday, it will be discounted at 99 Kg/kg on Tuesday - can you describe me the mechanism by changing the meat's price to become a burden for my digestive system?
And I'll wait until Thursday and that meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption discounted to £69/kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by £120 and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These tricks about the fact that if something is cheap, then it must be guaranteed bad, corrupted or unquality are terribly delayed to tell you the truth ;-)
Now I recently went to Brno to Hlavas, and in the underground of the lady gave some brochure, I always take things like that to help the brigades, they can't throw it out...
Well, the brochure was full of misunderstanding and conservative views of the world's functioning, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I felt it would be such an agitation.
After reading, I found who published it, and finally scientology came out of it.
Well, as it was a good motherfucker, full of totally unnecessary pounds, as I have to wash and not be a pizza.
It's a shame for the paper, that's why the washings shouldn't go.
I’ve experienced something like that with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional excitement force you to satisfy this person because you love him without realizing how much it is in this situation.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went with a friend she didn't like to get out.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment before, she cried and asked me not to go anywhere on her knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
A year it was a great relationship, but then it took another half a year and began to shake it on the shoulder.
Then I stopped the relationship with what I said to her that I'm divorced, but I can talk about it next week so I can calm her down and don't take any amok again.
Such a person out of you exposes emotions, emotions, and overall joy.
I prefer to keep a departure
When the insurance companies are groaning up here by purchasing a cloud of tests and hunting for positives, they wouldn’t even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, transporters and others, because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of domestic prison.
In the west, they stopped with the sharpness and admitted that it wasn’t worth treating the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new and has to grow up something more, and move on to the ego by inventing the buzzing.
I look at the old good shit coming back.
After a few years of ease and suppression of this innocent business, MLM recruting again returns to the declaration.
I was one of the recruiters, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first of all), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly turned into "this doesn't matter, mostly see people."
Honestly, I was interested in the products I offer, as I wanted to help people, however, training was rather about how to scare a man and to make him worse.
When the first earned money came, a person quickly realized that if he wants to earn, he has to survey a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgage were the only profitable, or then a person felt as a home dealer.
But what I can say, the experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump on every sphere and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't put all in one pond.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but you will certainly not be proud of expensive consumer goods or a "small" account.
I haven't experienced a lot of things in the company where I'm doing.
HR is calm, managers look at their management and they don’t get much into our nose.
Regular evaluation is then happening somehow, in the form that is happening with us it goes quite quite (set some goals for next year, let’s look at what went and what wasn’t) - it’s rather self-assessment than you’d be assessed by some numbers, and so on.
Business events are also uncommon.
But we are even a little unique within our company - they are the departments that are more "corporative".
Sometimes a person feels like we're a near-startup that's squatting in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so that they don’t bother us as long as the results are.
The Czech Republic is missing in the UK after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days ago, the British police sought the missing 32-year-old Czech, which was lost by the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social networks that a woman from Hungary was found dead.
The British police said this afternoon to our representative office in London, unfortunately, that they found the body of missing Czech citizens.
The cause of death is investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide more information about the case.
Honest sympathy, he said on Twitter Kulhánek.
The young woman saw her last on the bus on the 28th of November when she left the job, and she had to take the money out of the banknote before she arrived.
Her disappearance was announced by her employees five days later.
The London Police began searching for her and Interpol ranked her among the missing people around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
A few days ago, the police arrested a man.
What he played in the case and what he suspected of, but did not publish.
In four municipalities, at the end of the year, new representatives were appointed.
On Saturday, 11 December, new representatives were elected in the municipalities of Komnja na Uherskohradiszka, Lužice na Mostecka, Nova Ves na Liberecka and Nova Vesna na Pelhřimovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities decreased by law or the number of elected representatives here declined.
In the new elections, 99 candidates were elected to 28.
Electoral participation reached 62.41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligibility voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The youngest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate documents were registered for new elections to representatives in those four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men were arrested in 28 representative positions.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the eldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes for us a relatively challenging but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections in the General Representatives and, above all, highly observed elections in the House of Ambassadors.
We mostly had to work under more challenging epidemic conditions that put greater requirements for equipment and personnel security, assessed Eva Krumpo, the first Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last election period was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 pm.
The results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday and will be published in the Legislative Assembly after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a dangerous infectious disease here took me a moment at the beginning, but it went without a larger stroke.
To cope with how idiotically a large portion of the population becomes on all its layers, I have a problem so far.
I am most pleased with the vaccination (morrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that the other people aren’t a coward.
It would be freed from the role of the president and the ability to re-acquire it.
The chance that this will happen really is, but like the others are talking about a lot of little here.
I'm not sure if the paper could be considered a traitor at all.
The Ambassador is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the State.
It had to be a bit more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: Increase the number of people up to 35 years of age who are free of sex throughout the year
The more younger adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously founded people, according to the DailyMail website.
A survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the percentage of younger people 35 who decline sexual life increased from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had no sex in the last year are more than ever before.
Other factors contribute to reducing the number of sexually active individuals, a survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them can be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
However, it could also contribute to the presence of media, social networks or video games that make young people a lesser and a lesser priority.
“Since 2010, the percentage of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has rapidly grown that they haven’t had sex over the past year,” IFS researcher Lyman Stone said.
In married people, sexual activity is more common, only 5% of them said they had been without sex in the last year.
For free people, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The loss of sexual activity also contributes to fear of pre-marriage and religious establishment.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married younger than 35 years is still declining.
Young people are divided into pre-marital sex, about 30% think of it as a bad thing, while about 70% think of it all right.
“It’s true that free individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behaviour will take this trend,” Stone says about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with pre-marital relationships, the reason for religious establishment is.
Since 2008, free people under 35 years of age who participate in religious meetings more than once a month have increased the abstinence ratio from 20 to nearly 60%.
Among “less believers” the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent,” Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic, also contribute to the reduction of sexual activity.
Studies have also shown that the likelihood of sex is less in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason can be the expansion of digital media, which obviously reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, “substituting” this need.
This trend was trapped mainly under the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The entire order of vaccination against covid is whether a society should force a part of the population to behave that they do not want, but that can save their lives.
It’s a relatively difficult question I personally most interested in the issue of social consciousness.
The question is, for example, if we do not order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could surely have killed an eighty-year-old who did not know much, we did not explain it well to him, heard some disinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and finally caught and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can be killed by the defeated opponent of vaccination, which, on the side of the SPD and KSČ, is about a shit and a totalitarian state.
Of the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unexpected retirees are probably part of the second group, so they will actually be able to do it themselves.
Czech without snow.
How can a mild cold be signed in fear of dryness?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the last few years.
Ski resort operators will not be covered without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the racing Jizerska 50s.
Is it a trend, or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for fighting drought in Czech Republic?
I'd have one story, but it's not about a pancakes.
One time at the middle school, a teacher led us through the whole city on a boat so that we could move on boats across the river.
We walked there once in such a very broad street, and we don’t see anyone in the middle – the followers of the Hare Krišna sect.
Of course, they've been sealed on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but they talked with a girlfriend.
When they left, we asked her and her teacher what he was saying to them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn’t have any souls,” she replied.
All of us, including the teachers, laughed all the way to the boat.
We're terrified.
It's not so much, but the system's going to get rid of it," said Orozovič.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honour.
“We are rejecting a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after negotiations.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly point out that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders, is the West's chance to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, even within the "normand group", which combined France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor informed the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Aleksandr Lukašenko artificially created a migration crisis and used people as live arms and weapons, because each night we record hundreds of attempts to cross the borders.
He talked to the Chancellor about further sanctions to make Lukašenk's regime and his patrons in Kremlin finally understand that we have decided to protect the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to DPA, assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in a dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukašenk regime with refugees.
Polish drunkards blamed the accident, trying to hide it
After a while the car returned to the place of the accident, but the truck was already driving another Jeep who tried to take the blame for herself.
When police told her that if she did not prefer driving and killing from the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 station said.
She confessed that another Jeep woman hit her in the vehicle, who asked her for help.
Police came to Celestine's sister.
They took her breathing tests and after finding that she had over two promiles in the blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she was going to talk about her actions in court.
The dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
The Czech creators of family comedy have been viewed in American stories about dogs of love.
But they forgot about the fundamental thing: the legality of the filmwork.
Following the film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people to live, we are now talking about the spectaculate emotions in the movies.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely refers to his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene, the speaker Hugo and some famous characters around him come back.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Sumavis guesthouse, who climbs and thus begins to call the cave, Julien's father with her partner and mainly her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenager girl who experiences first love.
The director and her partner Beatriz Šajmovič (which is also the producer of the film) faced the narrative procedures already in the previous dog of the picture, but they enjoyed at least children and dogs there.
This time, the creative couple wrote even a weaker scenario, which triggers a mix of admiration and feelings of madness.
Let's take a look at it.
Julie, although the scientist, is subject to the desire of the child's dark blasphemies, and if the right "constelation" comes, copules with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinator decides – to depart from the cave of the car or the church tower, to depart from the forest to the forest, the departure to the forest, the departure to the local departure.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer wonders, however, what content pelmel full of incredible situations and figures needed for this message.
Two staff thieves, a competition of birds, a Suma's Charlotten, cops coming to seek "drogues" and discussing herbs about the harvest power of the bone marrow – which the family is sealed at the pension of, of course, opium.
When a hero is tested after a heavy coma, sitting on a non-smoking and overwhelmed with a cigarette at the family table, and the father’s whiskey and flacons are required to be treated as a vegetarian, it cannot be laughed.
The project will explain to the audience that “this happens sometimes after the coma.”
Shajmovich’s team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of work with text, the ability to build a nose situation, the feeling of characters and point and directed leadership.
Actress performances are unbalanced, screwless, and the overall impression is overwhelmed.
No matter how Lukas Vaculík, Jitka Yežková or Nela Boud is trying to marry their party, they don't have too much to play.
The only poetry of the film remains the poetry of the nature of the sweater cameraman Vladimir Holomka and a couple of sweatermen.
It is not enough to design a few characters, a cathartic fold and dog folds, even the more human vulgar expressions of which characters come to an end.
The argument is not an airline membership in the Klub of the breeders - as in the case of the producer lady.
Behind good intentions to promote nature and friendship of a man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the work to tell a credible story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family picture there is a little too much erotics and a minimum of different for genre.
Even as an advertising for canis therapy, this amateur little bit wouldn't go through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant insurrections just from the fools like you.
There's a difference between offering and force, here's to see how fucking you understand it, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to a kid like that, you might change your mind.
It's work like any other, in the case of a brigade for a payroll.
The Middle East suffers unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time in the year when it rains.
“The total absence of precipitation during November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual,” the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel announces November only 6% of the long-term precipitation average.
This week’s two-day rain was an exception.
It's good for us.
He hasn't been here for a long time.
This is also the right Christmas cult, the resident of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfalls in Israel come nearly exclusively in winter months, are striking and irregular.
In the winter rains there are dependent forests.
Without them they dry and are susceptible to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about the stocks of drinking water and forest for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the lake of Galilee, has been filled by the last three rainy winters this spring.
Since then, the level has fallen.
The water owners have been warning about drying.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall can remain here,” Israeli water economy spokeswoman Uri Schor said in 2018.
Israel is able to help with technologies such as waste water discharge or recycling.
There are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Ammán, there are tank vehicles.
The waters and private holes are drying.
“This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to two previous years,” said cistern driver Imád Solomon in September.
In Iran’s Isfahan, conflicts between farmers and security forces broke out.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The hill of the local rivers was completely waterless.
The region has been the dryest November in the last few years.
Israel prepares military intervention against Iran
Israeli Defence Minister said the Vienna negotiations had "not made any progress" and informed Washington about the preparation of the attack on Iranian nuclear equipment.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis said.
Gantz, a resident of the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to put their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During the Florida press conference, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had "not made any progress" and the world powers "understand that Iranians are playing with them."
It happened to me about three years ago, too.
I liked the lady a little bit and grilled in the interview to find out what she really wants for me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion for a pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these fucks, so I've just broke out the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked him and left.
Tell me quietly that I've been crazy, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisers are financial advisers.
The skiers went to the mountains for the weekend, waiting for enough snow and nice weather.
The mountain centres in the Czech Republic experienced the first major effort of skiers this weekend.
After snowing out at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some skiers have started operation.
The rider has also not claimed the obligation to demonstrate covid certificates in the case of trails.
While pullers don’t complain about each other, some hire ski equipment report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people arrived on the runways and on the trails for the weekend in Liberia.
Skiers wanted the weather that the sun offered today and excellent snow conditions.
“We are pleased that this starting weekend has really gone out since Friday evening skiing when we had the first skiing on the hill,” said Ještěd Jakub Hanuš, director of the Sports Area.
Hundreds of people arrived in Autumn for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or Branné on Šumpersk were opened.
The weekend was very nice, and the estimated 400 people arrived on Saturday and today.
The conditions are sudden.
Today sunlight light, it was about a minus three degrees, so perfectly, did not save the honourable representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski operators can sell skipas only to people who are vaccinated or are within the time period after the treatment of covid-19 disease.
When people are ready to do so and show the necessary documents, said the Czech Republic René Hroneš from the ski center Špindlerov Mlýn.
“We only recorded incident units,” he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic reports some rentals and skiing equipment stores.
Fortunately, the interest in loan skiing is.
It’s not like in the past years, but it’s still enough for customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opavia store Skiopava.
More effort is expected during the skiing courses.
Snowbear, David Šinták, is also aware of the fact that it is not such an interest in lending ski equipment as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost loaned.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said the TKK Shintak.
According to him, the people with the pandemic were depressed and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by lease in Novako Area on God’s gift.
The skiing started there a week ago and the interestholders have to order them in advance now.
“We are starting to lease this weekend, but people have already been calling forward, so we expect a great interest, just as last year,” said Paulina Novákova, operator of the field.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also a skiing school.
If we want successful and rich people not to go abroad, there must be an opportunity to experience quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include social healthcare, where it is often impossible to obtain a dentist or a specialist.
Smart and skilled people go abroad who don't have any property.
The owner of the company is not going to leave abroad.
The rest, however, totally agree.
If these people don’t live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don’t have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began by winning Orban one beautiful day, ruling a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It’s naïve to think that the Czech Republic cannot be in a similar position every day.
Another question is the choice.
If there's a fool living here, there can be a traditional V4k madman here too.
Youth and education will leave, and its supporters and people whose property cannot be put into the airplane.
Amazing photo!
Langmager in the blood for beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic he was in full flow of autumn, in Thailand, the Isle of Islands in front of Jirim Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor on social media published a bleeding photo of his face.
Is it a real injury, or is it a kidnapping?
The London police are still looking for the unofficial Czech Republic.
She was last slaughtered on the way home.
"Peter's disappearance is not like her behavior at all, and we start to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor, from the police department in Lambeth, said in a Saturday video.
“His family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and in short she wants to know where she is,” she continued.
On Sunday, November 28, she left work around 19:45 and went home to Camberwell.
The last time she was claimed to be sleeping in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
Srnc, according to British media, acted as a nurse assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas Hospital Association.
“We have great concerns about our dear colleague Petru, who is unknown,” a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her find to contact the police," he continued.
The public also calls for cooperation by Ms Harriet Harman, who on Saturday noted the case of Srnc at the press conference.
"She's unknown for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously stunned to death," the labourist politician said, holding a woman's photo in hand distributed by the London police.
“I feel that we all have a special responsibility to try to find it because she was outside her home country, away from her family and worked here for our healthcare,” Harman said.
Police have already arrested a man who remains in custody.
According to the BBC, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine like this either.
It’s not a big amount, but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are increasing the threat of the Invasion and begin to have our full teeth entry.
I cited upstairs.
I don't know why you thought Russia wanted war.
The war is fucking funny and Russia has GDP Italy.
Compared to the situation in the year 38 is out of so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare this to the first Pune war and the "anxie" sicilian :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it is unwilling to comply with the agreements with Minsk, Russia is attracting those ridiculous republics.
That's all the way, and this "concentration" at the border would be the same.
Well, the deal is a slave...
New schedules will be paid in Prague since Sunday, mainly for urban connections.
Passenger in Prague’s Integrated Transport (PID) is waiting for several changes since Sunday, especially for urban connections.
There were new lines, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital of the city, the bus stops from the Czech Budějovic in the Garden City station since Sunday.
In direct train transport, trains S7, which on the routes from Beroun to Czech Brod pass to Prague’s main station.
In the newly operated Prague-Garden City station, the R17 speeder will be re-stop from Czech Budějovic and Beneshov.
The PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Slightly nad Sazava, Blatna u Jesenice, Old Splavs and Turnova.
Buses to Mladoboleslavska will be included including lines with transfers to the Libereckie and Kralovéhradské kraj.
77 lines will be cancelled when integrating, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 functioning ones will be adjusted.
From Prague Zličína, a new bus line 405, which goes to Zatce.
There was also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice at Rakovníka, which replaced the cancelled train line S53.
It will be reinforced in the morning and on weekends, the connection from Prague to Rakovník will be reached when Express Line No. 404 will be re-elocated.
The PID system includes lines 400 and 410 riding to the Liberia region.
It goes from Strzežkov subway station, not from Holešovice Station.
The back line 400 goes through Malník, Dubai and Czech Lip to New Bora and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 goes through Malník and Dubai to Doks, Mimona and Jablonný in Podještědí.
On the contrary, new traffic is cancelled or restricted to dozens of central-Central local routes, including Mochva, Dobriša or Rožmital under Tremshen.
All trains with departure from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the routes of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysa nad Labem and the surroundings of Cologne.
Changes are waiting for passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled rail lines or extend the line 420 from Dobriša with the succession of Prague, where you can use PID tickets to Milevska.
The routes from 540 to 543 to Nymburg were changed and some bus routes were adjusted on the border between the Central Czech and Hořovicka in Plzeňské kraji.
Healthy meal/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hello, I do classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Because I have no movement, I have no strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy as possible and dietically.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at the speed of purchasing the maximum pizza from the bulb and to a chicken of yogurt and apple.
Question: What would you recommend to me to buy in a supermarket without a healthy heat adjustment?
Not everyone is waiting for a snow meter like you, so unfortunately.
It’s not about trees you need to see.
Only a top tree can be hidden under the snow.
If it is denied, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I don't say that's the only reason why we're banned from driving outside the trails, but that's one of them.
Recognition of Dary’s relationship with Never-consciousness: I wasn’t proud of this at all
The Czech showbusiness fisherman since Friday lives nothing but revealing the relationship between Dary Rolins and Paul Nedvěd.
They've been together for years, the famous footballer has even left to divorce for the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to fans in which she explains why love has been hiding for them for a long half year.
“I’m allowing myself to claim that there is no one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would have escaped that Dara had captured a bear, so forgiveness, the Nerd,” said Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But he said he got it, not the opposite.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the public’s interests, they do not enjoy it.
And it's here.
What we both did not expect, but we knew it would happen once, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse on that.
If those who don't care about it, and they jump out of the conservation, or We whose lives are smaller.
As if someone of you would like to hear an opinion of whether you’re fit enough with your husband or girlfriend, or you’d have to wait for, but really everyone knows a detailed list of your former partners and be familiar with counting your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a joke, that's what you want, Daera.
The two went together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvid has been working there for a long time as vice president of Juventus Football Club.
They went out with the truth until now, because they were waiting for the end of the divorce of Unconscious.
With his wife Ivana, they have been separated for three years, not theirs in paper, but only three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who are happy with us and want it to us.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
Therefore, I love my new husband, as he is with me, and I stand in him. In good things, and in evil things, Rolins shut up.
Hello, the other commentators have already said all the essentials, I just confirm that the trains are super at the beginning, my colleagues usually met in the first semester or two, and then find us hire together, which will come to me as the best option, because you know who you are going to live with.
Apartments usually don’t advertise too long ahead, so you don’t find too much now, but looking at the offer will certainly not hurt.
Otherwise, avoid not only Ceyla, but also the surroundings (the streets like Vranovska, French etc., it's a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a bit ghetto.
On the contrary, the quarter of Veveří is a lot of student, the King's field and therefore it's fine, in addition, it's close to most of the VUT faculty (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I've never hired the rental, but I'm a birthday Brnyak, so I can consult Brn as such if you've missed some information yet :)
This is an example of a "normal" thought.
Due to what several doctors have decided to do in Poland, it’s actually entirely okay that the state doesn’t finance some schools enough.
Whether they learn what they want and pay it from their own or they go according to the state and pay it for the state.
However, we can’t let a private actor control the piece of education just because a couple of crowns come to the full state contribution and, thanks to this, he will be able to learn what he wants at school.
Such a claim is slightly lost in weight when it is written by a person who expressed himself as a petitionary action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a voice against that if someone goes to abortion is the same for you as a voice against that a soup stands on the square?
I'd like to talk to you directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, when cataloging/digitalization, I have already experienced that (and even long-term professionals) it is either in a way that fits the eye, or they will write something on a way xxx *** or ... (by convention) and in a note that it is in readiness.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readily, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I would be able to deal with it somehow in a note on which program you are using.
If you want to be a good and active student, you can look at some character databases and look for the closest.
But since it seems like you're picking up from a book, I'd suggest that the author or printer simply created his own character, sitting on the physical part of that coin.
PS: Isn't that the Odry Empire (Kingdom) rather than OdryNská?
PSS: Someone has already made it fun of you here.
Look at this comment with FILLH
Politicians don’t even know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
It's much worse than having interpreters with them.
The assumption that they would accept something because no one understood a text is smiling.
All important approved documents are being examined a word from a word, for as well as some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and translators work in different EU institutions, and English is suitable for politicians rather than for informal relationships, making over-standard relationships.
In addition, this is quite interesting with the English language, after the UK is out of the EU.
I don't understand that hate on the whole.
I've been working there for a third year and I've been fine.
How many times I drive from work at 10:00 and never a problem.
That it's a ghetto can only tell anyone who has almost failed there in life.
Yes, most of the Roman population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is hinder the walk and park where they don’t have:D is definitely not that I would be afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you are looking for a relatively cheap accommodation with good availability in the center, I would be quiet to go there.
The full of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built there.
Felix Slov Slovak (78) without Dada and Gelem's love as a coat in the plot!
Who will spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people burned the first candle on the advent veil, but Felix Slovak didn’t.
I don't have an advent veil, so there was nothing to burn.
I have seen a grandmother, and Lucie certainly has some of my, said Blesku, a saxophonist, who so confirmed the words of Patras that he frequently visits her.
He visits but does not stay in their house in Vinohrad, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
The dictionary still doesn't know where it will be on the night.
We've recently met Annika, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we're still talking about something, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I’m always buying gifts and Dad and Lucia I’m sure I’m buying something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the music video in the Richman Club alone.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel myself.
I always find someone with whom I like to have fun, the Slovak, who was happy to meet the wife of Ludwig Saturday Adrian or the singer Kamil Newlt.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we couldn't have any arms?
I doubt someone will defend us, and our destination is so strategic that the aggressor must be an absolute idiot to not occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so you'll explain it to me?
I don't know any other component that could be planted in hospitals in a crisis.
Police are few and can't afford to do so, just like hackers and nowhere else there is such a high percentage of health-trained people at this level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending the Ostrava just goes on the head of the previous governments, not the army, is asking for new toys for a long time.
Record dryness in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural grants, the landscape should not only be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic has been through the worst dry season in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters were in the mountains and underhorn regions, a smaller number of rainfalls even recorded places where there was no need for moisture.
The cause of dryness, mostly in Central Europe, is climate change.
It also strengthens the way we handle the soil.
What to prepare for in connection with drying?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Yes, I’m hardly on the ice, I know how to play hockey, and that tactic (which I’ve tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also totally halo.
Whether you’re a hockey team “Russia beast” or “China beast” lose two goals even if you don’t have to win them at any cost.
But like what I listen to Czech commentators who are eating, what the arbitrators don’t notice, whether male or female hockey, it’s quite strange, but it’s probably the same with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
The controversy is everywhere.
And if it was the opposite, it is like always, and that the Czech Republic and Russia lost more often than they won, it would probably be a classic "wolfs lost" and "we won".
Coronavirus: Russia's number of infections exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily penalties.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died, and 74 others died.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days were in the Czech Republic in 1967 to 100,000, 871 to 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been recorded.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
The UK faces a "inevitable" large wave of infection caused by Omikron, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, head of medical advice for the British Health Office on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in the UK and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
No one has died in the omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the infection.
British labourist boss Keir Starmer on Sunday noted that Boris Johnson probably broke the law by organizing a Christmas quest at Downing Street in December, when the lockdown was introduced and the Christmas party was banned.
One of Johnson's governments said the queue was "virtually" via the computer.
However, he was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers at Downing Street.
In the UK, the pressure to remove Johnson from the prime minister’s office is stronger.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas party was banned, Johnson’s ministers organized numerous lockdowns.
The British public and the media say that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial TV ITV for Britain: Boris Johnson won the majority in general elections two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative Party talks about the need to remove it from the position of the Prime Minister.
Surprisingly how quickly the events evolved.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for elections in the spring, which can end the 12-year-old government of Viktor Orban.
It will be the elections of an integral European importance.
How long can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free, because these were not even the last two elections under Orban.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to benefit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, it sounds like everyone can choose where he wants to.
This will allow Fides to congratulate voters from decisive rounds to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It wasn't about whether Fidesz won, but how much and whether it will have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will gain a united opposition.
That's a great unusual for Viktor Orban and his side.
Will they not keep playing much harder?
Yes, we have some signs that they're ready to go into the framework of what they've done so far.
Recently, the recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders, Fideszo László Kövéra, has escaped from the independent media, where the secret service chiefs say that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of a new approach you are talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those newspapers.
Everything starts with the language.
I was struck quite often, the last time in 14, my mother's parents don't have too much patience, I don't, my father has long, but then pains extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very cholerous and I ran as a little scary, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a bowl and was entirely blue, it was about 2 times taken under my shower to calm down.
Sometimes they danced, sometimes it was rather that they didn’t know anymore.
Definitely now I have also the tendency to deal with things with violence, as little as I washed quite, now I waste at least into something, and as younger I need my parents so crying over my arms I need (they didn't get too much over the trap), so never anything extreme, but always requires that mom.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my explosion, but I am sure that this education has its share.
I’m afraid I’ll lose patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think the killing of children is simply wrong and my parents shouldn't do it, especially when it wasn't "educated," but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent's just something, maybe it's not possible at least a bit of killing their children, so I don't count it on them.
I don't know why the OP should be ashamed of it.
The laws should be clear and clear.
I would like to call them the ones that the laws make up in such quality.
Otherwise, would I be wondering if you are afraid of loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have a mortgage from which to pay?
Cockner's stupid world.
Where will Slovakia launch a trial with the killer of journalist Kuciaka?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the fourth accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martiny Kušnírová.
The death of a investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She also disclosed the practices of the accused entrepreneur, Marián Kočner, and his connection to the tops of Slovenian politics and justice.
How important is the process for Slovakia?
That's what journalists can do.
How is it possible that this petty had regularly greater media attention than the petty of the Deans of all the medical faculties that came out on a day, two later?
But they left to get stuck, and the company jumped out.
She died on the Czech TV with Covid a half a year ago.
The next government ends, and the law on the involvement of the municipalities in the selection of storage anywhere
Minister Karl Havlíčka's proposal needs to be amended fundamentally
The government of Prime Minister Andreje Babiše is at the end and there is still no law to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in choosing and allowing a deep storage of high radioactive waste.
The Legislative Council suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted to the Government after the years of transition by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the relevant municipalities associated with the Platform against deep storage, but also with the Union of cities and municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governmental authorities are expecting a more significant increase in their options for stock decisions, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the Czech nuclear law and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition contract, will rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The bill proposed by Minister Karl Havlíc, which has the Platform, concerns the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the decision-making process is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can be effective only if the municipality or the public can affect whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by depositing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before the initiation of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal of a matter aims almost completely against public involvement and makes municipal citizens practically mere statistics in authorisation procedures.
The design lacks the system settings of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting the location for storage, permitting and operating.
Representatives of municipalities in reality, according to today’s legal standards, do not have too much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in search of storage space.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may make comments or withdraw, but the authority or minister decides in the interest of which the authorisation is granted.
The applicant has no delayed effect on the conduct of investigations or construction works.
The self-determination of the authorities requested by the Platform is the principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and, of course, in those where they have already advanced in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is a further failure of the state administration, which employs external legal offices for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by the Court and entitled to contracts with the lawyer Jane Zeman.
The total amount for these works is to be approximately 4 million crowns according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknička, vice-star of the municipality of Cejle from the site of Hraddek and spokesman of the Platform against the Deep Storage, said: After the ministers of the industry, who set up the position of self-control against state authorities in search of a deep storing of high radioactive waste just condemned to their successors, we wait for a further outgoing of the government.
We also offer helping hand.
We also thank the Union for the support of cities and municipalities, which considers the problem of inadequate municipal rights in such essential buildings similar to the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Deep Storage Platform combines 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to request changes in State access to the management of fired nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not only be limited to the Deep Storage.
The platform further encourages that the decision to choose a location for possible storage be conditioned by the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Dr. John Goodman (69) forced to lose weight: Shodil 90 kg.
Although for many years there was no need to change his lifestyle, he was finally scared by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that took it.
Goodman gradually matched 90 pounds, which is half of his original weight of 180 pounds, according to The Sun.
He praised his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
Roseanne is a completely different person from the sitcom pocket!
John enjoyed laughing that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture breaking.
"I've all thrown into my mouth," the actor said in 2018 in an AARP interview.

It also depends on which boss and what you want to use the word "boss".
If it is a text on a platform that expects readers from the game environment, I wouldn’t translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and, for example, a university, I would probably look for how the Boss would rather describe or explain.
There are more types of boss.
Maybe the game like Dark Souls etc. has a few boss that yes, and so there is a "boss" something like a man/superman given level, and then there is a final boss...
In many games there are hidden boss (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to beat in any way to complete the game or level, but they are often even stronger than standard boss.
Then there are games such as Half-Life, where the boss are, but the player doesn’t get straight with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they call themselves anyway?
And then there are mini boss.
It is pausally literally somehow translating the boss simply is probably not going, Czech or other languages do not solve it in any way (it is so interesting that only Catalan, which bosse translates as the final opponent).
It’s a short story or game that’s generally important, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than any previous and guarding finishing some level or task.
After the lost Peter from London, the whole world is searching for.
The Czech police also joined.
After the disappearance of Peter Srncové, the British police have been searching for since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradyska is looking for since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol helps the British police.
The Czech Republic was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
The British police have been searching for it since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circuit for her.
Peter is looking for the whole world.
“The Czech police work closely with the British police,” police spokeswoman Katherine Rendl confirmed.
“We share information about the case together,” he added.
The search for Peter has already appeared on the police site.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters high, it is sharp and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
They should come from Uherskograd.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, for such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Peter was also engaged in the search for the deputy Harriet Harman.
She was engaged in lifting sheets with Petra's face.
“We’re worried about it,” she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, the British police have arrested one suspect.
But it’s not clear what Peter was talking about.
The Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decline in the attack campaigns, last month with the coming year’s attacks significantly increased.
We recorded a big campaign with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted on the Czech Republic.
The attackers’ strategy is still the same.
The infected annex in the email should draw attention to the user with the name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous annex in the name of the invoice, this time it was labeled as a copy of the fixed account for 11,2021...exe,” Martin Jirkal from Esetu said.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for saved login data that will then be sent to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in the spring of August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the spyware also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security experts in November captured rather a global campaign.
Compared to the October data Formbook was slightly weakened in November, but still worth almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity in the days 3, 10 and 15 of November.
The formbook most often contained a .exe file extension containing the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account also appears.
The Annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech users.
A significant decline and decline in activity shows security analysts in the Fareit program, which cost 1.6% of the attacks, and in the Czech Republic had no larger attack campaign in the last few months.

The reason for Prague was larger than the media stated.
According to the recordings of the coastline, and according to the demonstrant’s experience, I’m not afraid to estimate about 10,000 people.
People in the industry filled the coastal bridge and the anti-left coastal communication.
This means that people really have a lot.
Around four thousand demonstrators are spontaneously added to the prosecution.
I'm saying something new is born here, writes Radek Mockry.

It is hard to say what movement could be made from this dissatisfaction depends not only on the oath of money, but also on whether the three-day vaccine from Pfizer will not be four and more dosage.
It will certainly not be left or middle movement, bet it.
The three-day vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose because it is obvious that we will have to be overvaccinated every six months.
I am very pleased that the vaccines saved us.
Genial actions of scientists whose humanity is proud of the right.
