Inflation in Europe has dropped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 euro area countries were more important than forecasts, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts indicated only 3%, Bloomberg said.
Unlike U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the direct interest rate by saying that the decline in interest rates, with the increase in raw materials prices and the decline in unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of inflationist spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to an analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "We need to dissuade" inflation to no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent has been a record over the last 12 years, and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has declined due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The final market shares of cereals have increased by 88 percent and the price of soya has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global oil price rose by 52 percent, and last month, a black gold baril cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the inflation rate over 12 months remains around 3%, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the direct rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December, thus now having the largest supporters since 2002, while Gallup (Institute of Survey) has never seen so low social support, i.e. 13 per cent before.
For faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greatest determination of opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the Hungarian Socialist Party.
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democrats Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below parliamentary threshold: their support is 2 percent in the entire population.
Of some loyal voters to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1%.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate in comparison to the lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been so high, rising to 41 per cent, and according to 46 per cent complementary, the situation is quite serious.
After the most optimistic outlook of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only a tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
In December last, 71 percent of the surveyed people, namely a majority ever seen in previous Gallup surveys, thought that the Prime Minister was doing his work rather bad than well.
13 percent of the surveys trust or have much confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not fully trust the Prime Minister and 27 percent the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society who think that discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without change in government.
While after the last October surveys, 35 percent of the surveys wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, this rate is currently only 20 percent, and the relative majority (33 percent) believes that taking new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention of voting, 60 percent of the surveys answer that they would certainly vote, and 20 percent of the supplementary say they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legal election organized next Sunday", only 55 percent of the surveys would certainly participate and 15 percent of the additional surveys would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be doubtful.
74 per cent of people would say no to the enrollment rights in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to the cost of consultation and 84 per cent would say no to the cost of hospital stay.
When we look at only the same proportions among people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly 20 percent
Hypermarkets implanted in Budaörs’ commercial triangle maintained the average price rise by 16 percent last year, unlike that this year’s VAT rate did not increase.
Article of Napi Economics (Economie Daily)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a significantly higher value increase than a thousand forints appeared in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “who had already flew” in large food stores in December last year, have no longer risen brutally compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained nearly at the level of last year, however the prices of the grid, nose and pavot have increased significantly.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed data from the KSH (Institut Central of Statistics) but, at Auchan, we found bread from a kilo to only 139 forints.
Competition did not drop the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, too, in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints the forint bottle included.
It prevents only this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the cheapest and Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, Cora increased the price of her daily basket by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the cheapest basket last year and the cheapest basket last year, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between the cheapest last year and the cheapest last year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in VAT rate had already noticed in the Christmas prices of last year.
This process made trade disturbed, hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply to products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader fails to calculate the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the trade intensity margin.)
Due to the change in the rate of VAT, the price increase in the daily basket was so excessively evolving that the most expensive basket was higher than 1,720 forints in 2006, while the difference between the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the most expensive basket value was higher than the last year's price of 1,630 forints and the lowest price of 1,284 forints also increased.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic rise in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption items increased by more than 30 percent in the hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH’s data: for some first-necessary foods, the Statistics Institute has observed a price rise by more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and eggs.)
According to the latter’s daily basket, this seems almost absurd as the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has just increased by more than 10 percent than the base.
According to the index, milk suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to accept the brutal price rise by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, most customers no longer look at prices in the three visited hypermarkets.
They buy in quantity, they take long-term foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important rows were trained at the boxes of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers has suddenly increased.
But, according to our information, the revenue is less important in the province, many multinational companies complain to survey companies not even reaching the expected revenue, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many hospitals save disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the wrong use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
Hospital hygienic conditions, the insufficient number of beds, overload of medical personnel do not help block infections, says the physician head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also save disinfectants
Not long ago a MRSA infection was diagnosed at the service of traumatology at János Hospital.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected in a hospitalized man due to a serious accident.
The sick has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury to a serious car accident came out of the hospital, but shortly after that it was necessary to return to the hospital due to an MRSA infection, and since then, doctors have not been able to do a significant operation due to the bacteria in their body.
Until December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistente pathogenic agent have been reported to the National Nasocomial Monitoring System, said Karolina Böröcz, head of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Knowing that it is the number of infections caused by a multiresistente pathogenic agent that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, otherwise said by staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicilline-oxacilline.
A third of the people are carrying Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as anginas, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily healed.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant antibiotic bacteria that will quickly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacteria can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicemia, in elderly patients, with small weights or with weakened organisms.
According to the director of the hospital János, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospitals.
In particular, we should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only or we do not look for them, Tibor Nyulasi said.
They are resistant to antibiotics.
"These sick are isolated, the care staff puts rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for curing them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carrying MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multiresistente pathogenic agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and residences for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized sick and immediately isolate MRSA sick people.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases only see the day if the MRSA infection is detectable on the sick, said the doctor head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for curing certain infections and syndromes.
We need to make efforts to target antibiotic therapy, otherwise microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take it into account.
The performance of microbiological sampling is even more rare in ambulance and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals save disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs spread from one to another most often through medical staff.
Therefore, it is important to wash your hands, put gloves and protective masks, but important deficiencies are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated sick can not always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while at the end of the epidemic, the sick should be distanced from each other at a minimum of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is demonstrablely lower or the proliferation of the pathogen may be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is exorbitant expenditure for social security funds, so we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to data published, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multiresistente pathogenic agents (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogenic agents.
The Commissioner, author of a deadly accident, was not in a state of drunkness
The official note of the deadly accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd round was drawn up.
It can be excluded that the 22nd round Commissioner, resigning from his office since, who has broken a footstool by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of drunkness or exhaustion, said Attila Morvai, spokeswoman of the Capital Public Ministry on Friday after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which had already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before it started flying.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd district commissioner crashed a 55-year-old man who found himself face to face when he turned with his personal car in the 22nd district street of Kossuth Lajos. The man wanted to pass the road without passing through the walks.
(In addition, the fact that it crosses the road outside the footway is not a relief circumstance, according to the Road Code, a car that amorts a rotation must let the footway pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following the accident, the Commissioner resigned from his office and asked for his retirement because, according to the police, the accident has been very burning.
The investigation into this case is conducted by the Parquet responsible for investigations in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner had cooperated with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
€400 million extra for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed in Budapest on Friday three agreements of a total value of €400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be achieved from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties a credit contract of EUR 100 million. This time, the signed contract relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The 150 million euro credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of €300 million for Hungary, the remaining €150 million could be used later, due to the extension of the credit contract.
The parties have signed a contract of €50 million for innovation, the state budget will first use this coverage as part of the research and development project to be implemented at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the subway line 4 project was also addressed.
The Parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary completed the details of the subway financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of 8.4 billion euros for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits according to the interest rate associated with EURIBOR, with a time of 8 years of gratitude and no commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of all Europe is turning to this Balkan country that has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who and who bought in this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly be expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the worst target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the coast of the sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, along the seaside, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "Solar Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasingly more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office surfaces promise the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe’s most attractive golf paradise and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
Most careful investors already buy a lot, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria at the same time seek to change their lives, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Malta and Cyprus investors are also present. On the edge of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we will traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, said Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are planning to stay buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from €50 to €100, or old deployed houses, at a price ranging from €5 to €15,000, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (from December last, Bulgaria has been one of the top 10 destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium- or long-term plus value.
The cost of capital buildings is constantly rising due to increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last 5 years they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals will end on Tuesday, however, after the official opening of the Ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians coming from 192 countries worldwide will discuss the Bali Road Sheet to define efforts to do after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are a lot of discussions on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that at the moment they did not want to discuss accurate figures, though they were ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 from 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990.
Another important topic of the conference is to see if developed countries are committed to providing financial and technological assistance to countries that need it, without reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been signed on assistance to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors consisting of 16 members likely within the framework of the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), said Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU’s ambition to maintain its role as an amiral vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20 percent compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was ready to reduce them to 30 percent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were able to take their lending capabilities as well.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signatories had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 percent, and the total of the 15 EU members of that time took their commitment from 8 percent to less.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, a press release from the Ministry of the Environment recalled.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be revoked after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the values set out in the UN'wide IP-wide peace protocol would not immediately be followed by a new report of the international emissions reduction system, which was the new international emissions reduction system
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
The units of the British Army communicate, on the video sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) who has been passionate about YouTube: the special units intervening in Afghanistan are charging video sequence on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC said.
These recordings, taken with the help of miniature cameras climbed onto the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force operations headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London or compatriots load them on the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
Air Force Soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this road and their "chain" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defense signed up there under the name of "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and communicated videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the Air Force, videos were passed onto the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they were also serving to make the public known the real objectives of the military's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs almost nothing compared to regular TV recruitment ads, reported to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, who consults for defence, but it also inevitablely bears a political message because it justifies in a special form the well-being of military operations decided by the government.
Americans made a game
The army is angry because, in addition to the composite and carefully censored videos, amateur videos have been posted on the share site which also show the death of soldiers: in “official” propaganda films, a little hypocrite, officers do not avoid talking about losses, but they never show the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many videos have already been on the net showing the operational zones in Iraq and Afghanistan that were performed in real mission, but the British army has only been loaded for the upload of these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment slightly differently using the American's Army shooting game free of charge. In this game, the player can place himself directly in place of soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and beige in the ministry
Mónika Lamperth, Labour Minister, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a meeting of the end of the year with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking beans and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a live music party, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a glass to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so it was fun with the power.
Public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the greatest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense, but it is not the employees of the Ministry that will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, family members of the soldiers who are currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere at the end of the year.
In comparison with the other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, from the six hundred wholesale employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this party, Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ’s Christmas costs 4,700 000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the National Justice Council (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
Renting the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, a tender management company.
The building of the Theatre de la Gaité was rented for this purpose.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have failed to join the responsible person.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building was not only welcomed by the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a dance for St. Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of their rooms.
The dance was five hundred people.
The party began with the words of the Minister’s welcome and the dinner was followed by a danced evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening dress was not entirely compulsory for this dance.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Local Communities prepare a celebration.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a feast to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the contrary, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party, but to a late-year work meeting.
Hundreds of eighty people are expected to be invited to eat coffee and beans, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his employees to take a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Communities and territorial arrangements.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It is worth spending 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No scheduled party atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's exhibit but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, Christmas celebration will not take place.
The reception will take place in Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Forest, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail for which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are initiated by a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate at all for Christmas, the respective press services [origo] reported.
The press service of the Ministry of Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
Nevertheless, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are assembled
The Liga trade unions and the National Workers Council Association will constitute on Friday their strike committee, which will be responsible for coordinating the undeterminated strike on Monday.
Saturday, a General Assembly of Protests will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Law on Health Cases, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant trails in traffic as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike up to 13h.
The League Unions will inform on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Workers Council Association.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, it will serve as a coordinator of Monday’s actions.
Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period of time if they are not able to find an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the parliamentary vote on the Law on the Health Cases, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Law on Health Cases, trade unions will immediately withdraw the call to the strike.
On the contrary, if the law is voted, the strike committees will meet and decide to take further.
According to the Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on the healthcare boxes would only take place late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the planned strike for Monday, important trails are planned in circulation: railways will stop working for an indefinite period of time and in the morning a portion of public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many civil unions and organizations have joined the call to the strike, and the list is constantly updated on the League site.
Some organizations report the strike for an indefinite period of time, while others have declared a temporary ceasefire.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Iron Roads) and the Free Cheminos Syndicate (VDSZSZ) have failed to find an agreement on minimum services, or, close to Christmas holidays, are increasingly those taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 13:00, the Budapest Airport between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning, the Industrial Electricity and thermal Energy Syndicates of the League will strike for four hours, respectively the Syndicate of Professors and g of 2 hours will strike for the Democratic Syndicate of Professors.
The National Association of Doctors will strike across the country in exchange, and the SZEF-related Health and Social Sector Union (EDDSZ) will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to social debate.
The second claim requires the new method of calculating the pension to be established from next year to be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee for retirement before the legal age, which would allow the functions that deserve it to be in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the Liga Trade Unions, the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railways and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard Increased Country Risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysing Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established in August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a better Hungary) increases in several aspects the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company notes that, in relation to the Hungarian Guard’s activity, the highest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic confrontations may occur due to the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the tzigane and nontzigane population of Hungary.”
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy to likely cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the major disadvantages of Hungarian political actors: “The public actors have passed the public debate on the Roman affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians.”
The problem becomes worse, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are seen reinforced, and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
But, according to the research institute, under the influence of increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard has "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, particularly concerning trust in the country's stability and democratic maturity."
They recall that, as a result of a larger advertising given to the reorganization of the radical and extreme right Hungarian groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves the “national self-defense association.”
“The common characteristic of these meetings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (calamities, national defence, defence of order), armed forces, if necessary, further, by mentioning the inactivity of police, army,” they added.
They reported that everything was happening according to the method that, based on the rancoring of the society of politics and parties, seeks to decorate different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
Consequently, the emphasis on the civil nature and association status serves not only to avoid legal traces of registration of these associations in the court but also constitutes a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbouring relationships.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential risk source, and ultra-nationalist politicians in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (NNU) in August 2007.
The many troubles of the Romans that collapsed in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) were the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
By taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to constitute a warning by saying that the organization’s objective is “national self-defense”.
According to them, in the past 17 years, the Tizigans have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, the Political Capital recalled.
They added that the initiative had led to live debates in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roman organizations on the constitution of their own guard as resistance indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Romans react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, it can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on risk change, they will inform the public, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The festivals are not uniform in the EU and in the United States as well.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as Sabbath holidays.
Sabbath days are often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also rest days, the last of which is more so that the awakeners can rest calmly.
In addition, in one year, we have all eleven celebrations marked in red.
March 15 is a national celebration, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, as is October 23 which is the commemorative day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the work party, and November 1 and 2 we remember members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases, or it remains only a working day before or after the red celebration.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Labour Minister has established a special regulation on the replacement days of the days before or after the holidays.
The law applies to all employers and to all their employees, to officials and to people working in public service.
However, it does not apply to service societies, institutions turning without interruption and in service, by their calling, and also for the rest days.
This year, the working days will only be changed around the end of the year: from December 24th, life ends almost all over the country because most people experience rather make extra hours or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year’s Day at home.
The next year many holidays will fall in the middle or in the end of the week, so there will be less changes in the working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at home for four days of affiliation.
Saturday, April 25, will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the contrary, next year, the end of the year will be announced under the sign of the feasts because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year’s day falls on a Wednesday.
Six foolish things that can terriblely envy colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, vocal messages that we never receive, innocent lies that are almost more engaging in us: these are things that “embellish” the daily workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these difficulties or face the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing problems to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that we called you from the marketing service,” a colleague said.
You missed an appointment?
Best of all, he is sorry and try to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he has forgotten to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There is nothing more irritating than wanting to take a file, a office tool or a phone, and you can find them anywhere.
You remember that you put her on the office the night of the watch, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you find your pen that you thought was lost at your colleague's desk?
Do not take anything to your colleagues without asking otherwise they are right to be angry with you because they have picked their good.
Don’t bring back covers, post-it in your pocket, because it can be embarrassing that there is no more and that you need it right now.
Do you papot the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop potens spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t abuse his confidence!
Enter in you the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in its absence even if your colleagues are also aware.
Do you declare yourself sick without just a reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a painful headache because you feel bad or think you need rest that day, think that your work, your urgent affairs, your ultimate missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't make trouble with your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you won’t work the next day or something that might happen to you that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to warn your head and colleagues to prevent them from being surprised by your absence the next day.
Fredonment, riding, telephone
You're blowing in your work, but the rising of your colleagues triggers you brutally?
You have become a witness of a phone conversation you would better not listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with colds, challenging, loud discussions (which you’re driving above their heads), foot strikes, big words or miscontents expressed in a loud voice.
They may disturb even if your colleagues aren’t wrapped into a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a fault?
If your work is not done for the specified time, you forget to send an important email or message, don’t accuse anyone for this forgotten!
Don’t put it on the account of the potential chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have committed a mistake and if this has shown disadvantages for others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix ignorance!
Do you feel too much at your office?
Put a jogging and shoes at home is comfortable but they don't fit in the office!
Do not put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself properly dressed, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet the expectations, you're no longer interesting
Let’s move slowly into the ordinary morning bowl.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard in the radio: the voice of a violon with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm lifting the sound.
The music changes the pace and the bottom arrives to accompany the shades of all time, then a female choral comes to join it as a real jewelry.
Mr2 diffuses the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
Hungarian music life hasn’t been shattered for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
Now, it seems that the bucket becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground, gradually begin to change the image of the whole, and despite the new mode of the garage rock breaking the guitar, the Hungarian electroscope proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he himself played in the Yonderboi group before he started on his own path, perhaps because “there is no room for two feet in the same shoe.”
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to get acquainted when he was assigned the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of the French Turks).
The training in small clubs began to be known by a larger public when the Wan2 magazine cited their first 2002 album among the 50 most important Hungarian market records and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only Hungarian creators of the trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his whole became unquestionably trendy, but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label well.
The group reacted as needed, it released a new and better disc.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the reference to the flight but next to the air music appears now, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, a real radio tube is found, Mr2 Petõfi, who has recently broadcast popular music from morning to evening, has started introducing Wings of Love melodies recorded with six Hungarian songs ("Underground Divas").
It's all right (?).
Hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube drives me to ask a question: is your music well left a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two casts in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and honest music.
The music itself says alternatives, underground can also be medium-sized and made only to sell them and become commercial.
A good pop song can be honest too.
Reception attitude also works in this mind regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign public, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Overseas, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
The people go to concerts and not only the youth of a ten or twenty years old but also the oldest.
They follow much more carefully the changes that have occurred in light music because they believe it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am of course glad to see that people are getting more and more at our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or the mutual influence is already working, but it is only perceived in the unsatisfactory changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you would no longer be interesting.
Hvg.hu: Do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made a career rather in the west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his way, even if some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust the other’s musical presence and let it be deployed.
Initially, it was inevitable that our music was compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and take another way.
hvg.hu: On Mr2 Petõfi's palmarès, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many of those who heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, have you consciously opened to a larger layer?
Zs.B.: We do not plan to make a pipe to sell the disk.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to adopt the audio orgy and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why are they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choral.
We had the idea to compose this choral of good solists from the Hungarian music scene.
So the choral was composed of six members, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, which was then baptized Underground Divas.
You wanted this song, or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This piece existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought it was still missing something in that song.
The following agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the melody that the girls learned later in the night.
I had him almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but certainly we needed Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disk and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have a single role, they all sing together and they don’t sing stronger than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their song.
They were behind on the scene as well.
Do you want it?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
However, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from, who goes, or, just let these wings, the wings of love, bring us.
I wanted others to also feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
Hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work most?
Zs.B.: Truely, no one about the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, gradually, everything was set up as in a puzzle.
What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “released” this disc.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader risked billions due to its infirmity complex
A disimulating fraud.
This is how his former employer named the French giant the General Company, owner of the Czech Bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equate his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he quickly recognized the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
"He's fragile," his senior officers told the police.
However, if we are referring to Kerviel's deposit report by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man at the end of last year produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the deposit.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the U.S. crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime" mortgages granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered backing difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I won my first half-milliard, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel trusts and adds that he had, of course, nothing kept for himself."
In all the questionnaire, he claimed to have falseed the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to dump his superiors, although the Eurex Stock Exchange began to be interested in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk nothing has nothing
He was scared of being discovered?
Instead, no.
“I estimated that the simple fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where does his will come to risk such big?
He only gradually reached his position.
He began working at the General Society in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary turned around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and, in 2005, became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“Since my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than others.
With regard to my university course and my professional and personal course,” Kerviel said.
But shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz’s shares, he won half a billion euros by putting this title down during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, you are left in peace
“There was like a snowball effect,” he told the police.
But the seniors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted about it.
"When I win, they seemed to close my eyes."
But that’s where the start of the year is happening.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the amount.
Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros due to it.
And how did we find it?
He became suspected because of his leaves.
Last year I took only four days of vacation.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to another,” Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has an opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed in nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could in the coming years bring €14 billion (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be intended for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds the Czech Republic can obtain in the context of these projects.
This money will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of $90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme, intended for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should serve to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new more effective management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic was among the new members, the least successful EU funds beneficiaries.
The Court confirmed 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaragua President
The Appeal Court of Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for former President of the country, Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released and lived to reside in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in the period between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again, it is currently unclear, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison agents, or they will let Germany end his punishment at home, or will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Court proved that Germany was regularly moving government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
It was fictional companies and accounts were actually belonging to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds Germany had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's the way.
The State budget has been adopted.
In what is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
That for the current year was spent a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party – ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who prepared it and ČSSD could not allow his refusal.
Unlike the debate before the vote of the government’s deficiency declaration, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether you want it or not, each chapter and each article constitute the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a part of politics, although hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that’s why more attention is given to the media.
Political disputes are much more interested in the opinion than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffer from three pains that the current budget is not capable of adjusting at the same time:
The first is the important part assigned to the charges imposed by law, constituted not only by retirement, but also by social burdens, adopted last year by the silent coalition grouping the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, this is not the state budget deficit that represents the biggest event.
This is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficiency of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often, in disrepute, issued bonds, debting their municipalities in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, taxes and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In recent years, they managed to repay these debts by the mass sale of shares of the distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained by the State as part of privatisations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If there are only official and verified facts, it is found that:
Our economy has been through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a growth phase and ČSSD has not been missing.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead of this, they were increasingly eating the state.
Other countries, except a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly back on previous governments.
We are part of countries that, globally, are the least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, we do not need massive social programs that, in recent years, unfortunately unnecessaryly inflicted.
Although some absurd populist expenditure, approved last year before elections, has been eliminated, if a discharge of the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the retirement system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power will only be administered.
By exaggerating hardly, it can be said that politicians with power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes normal expenses refunded by mandate expenses.
The expected deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments hadn't dispatched all the money they could.
If we really don't want politics in power to become simple bureaucrats, we need to be patient and award to this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can spend only the equivalent of what is happening in taxes and taxes, the calmness necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only those latter who will gradually reach a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, interest rates to which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and will provide 24 billion to European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take a concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
“This approach tends to resolve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow,” Bernard Baumohl wrote in his report to customers from Economic Outlook Group.
“Central Banks’ concerted action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent,” Baumohl said.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other billions of losses.
“If central banks have chosen this approach, they have to really learn what can still follow,” ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies said.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central Banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will borrow more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and push the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks have made this choice after failing to lower the London Interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, despite the U.S., Canadian and English Central Banks have declined their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a new reduction in interest rates," Reuters Greg Salvaggio told Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that central banks’ approach will not help to conjure the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologist debates are incredible
Global climate change must be harmful mostly to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again pronounced the problem of planetary warming.
This time the criticism took place at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not green, he argued that environmentalists’ debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, constituted by a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and the reality.
“The debate is not structured there at all, it is just a word missile, replacing solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance for him and that is why he is also committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction with what his book also appears in German translation, because, he said, “I often only meet the caricature of my opinions.”
Nowadays, interested people can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus has recalled that although he is not a climateologist, he has, in his opinion, enough arrangements to write such a book.
In fact, he is an academic capable of tracking and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theories: the climate is constantly evolving, the changes are therefore normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on planetary warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, therefore they are inconsistently used inconsistently inconsistently.
More than having experienced a totalitarian regime, it considers it unacceptable to impose inspected opinions to others, what it feels as a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and profits they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago, at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving permit in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have left the deadline and have failed to renew their former driving licence, whose validity reaches the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still request renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permission will borrow the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving permit, especially those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a decline in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are invading applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has been increasing this week.
The Mairie satisfies approximately 2,000 customers per day.
There's a row of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issue of a new license takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the delivery within a short term of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an extra of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not succeed in carrying out the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and we will borrow the road without a valid licence will risk a fine by January.
The guilty will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police can also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is raised to 2500 crowns.
According to ancient information, a fine was likely even a person who was not going to circulate.
This could have been forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called for the authorities to moderate and to impose fines not exceeding 1,000 crowns.
But, according to the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one risks penalties in tens of thousands.
The driving permit is, according to him, a document that people can decide whether or not they wish to have it.
It is not like with the identity card, which must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should return their driving licence.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to renew.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court Reduced Penalties of Detectives Pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of connivation with the band of David Berdych, will be sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison respectively.
Thus, the Supreme Court of Prague condemned them definitively by reducing their penalties of 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, the Detectives of the Department for the Combat of Organized Crime had been punished for 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only one appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently only waiting for the first-instance verdict.
However, he has already received punishment in other trials whose amount exceeds 16 years of jail.
He can't get more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal recognized guilty for participating in 19 holdups, and the Supreme Court today treated 16 of them appeals.
The majority of the accused have since the initiation of the investigation remitted the accusation by affirming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court, after an agreement with Berdych, police members were transferring information to criminals from police sources, covering the various hold-ups and helping members of the band to avoid criminal liability.
The band refunded 30 percent of the larcin in Opava and Koňařík.
In the accusation it is about the gang's criminal activity between 1999 and 2001.
Essentially, armed-handed flights of which victims have suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power from a public agent and prohibited arms.
In case of domestic searches, police have discovered illegally detained guns, shells with a steel nucleus, a laser direct shooter or a mitraillette.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched tens of millions of crowns.
Except for nearly twenty men from the trial, the courts have already recognized guilty of other hand-lived flights Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men from Berdych's neighbourhood are still examining themselves before the court in another case, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has for the moment avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are waiting for the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
Children's Replacement Price: 12 million
Igor Veleba’s lawyer wants to get 12 million crown compensation from Třebíč’s hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for the fathers, and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
This is why the hospital lawyer Ondřej Dostál absolutely does not agree with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, this is very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
“To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposition, we need an expert report whose opponent ordered the drafting.
We're going to check if this has some explanation.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands,” Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family asked for a million crowns for each month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting compensation negotiations.
According to psychological and psychiatric experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at various scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better tolerated by men, although they have been confronted with remorse from not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they, are less serene in the face of the trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening right now, the contents of the Veleba report summarized.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč Hospital on December 9, last.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Przybyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
By the end of October, the governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil gave 100,000 crowns to each of the families for repayment of expenditure caused by the Třebíč hospital error managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are forced by law to civil liability insurance.
In the event of a lack, they must put into the reserve background, exceptionally, they may request assistance to the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, and the amounts calculated according to the tables were hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka a perdu Valašské Kingdom (from Royaume de Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute on the brand Valašské Kingdom (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was actually him who used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was launched by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former actor collaborator.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not finished and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team parasite about Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valašsko refer to everyone just that actor and comic.
Harabish is the same opinion.
“There was almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are those who want to parasite on our work,” he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his television broadcast.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him in 1993.
But at that time there was nothing to do with the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making the passports of the Valašské Království.
From a humorous action he originally came out of it a profitable business and business activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997, Polívka accepted that his name and signature were quoted in the passport and even offered to the holders of balances on the visit price of his farm and his theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has only made use of the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manéž issue, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the Valašské Kingdom project," the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and its team that was dedicated to the project in an intense manner.
The cooperation between today's enemies continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official crowning for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition "the first chosen king Boleslav for ever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and its company, requesting that the court rejected today.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half of the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He still didn’t want to betray the details and date.
“We don’t want to go quickly.
That would be something like the king's dispatch in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can, of course, register,” added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi Test: Prejudice disappearance
I have never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and manufacturing could, in many ways, be qualified as less than the average.
Now, the Peugeot 207 is on the market, which is much better.
The more the combi named SW goes a step further, there is nothing more than to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained for example about the space for the head on the back seats.
While there is an end to the complaints because the combi carrosserie means that even the great demons will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see quickly done
I'm going to talk very quickly to the interior so that I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only note on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have loved a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or too short dossiers is revolutionized.
The side guide was also significantly improved compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the carrosserie is also sensitive there.
The combi also sees disappearing the lack of space above the already mentioned head.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing on this vehicle is its luggage support.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivotant ice) and a rather easy arrimage.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not covered and can be extended while being able to hold objects heavy enough.
But let's stop the volume.
This, according to the tables, is 428 l in the basic configuration, which is rather average compared to competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot remains very significant behind, the difference is 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or charging a bullet, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to make the advantages out, I would mention below the remaining cash after the reverse of the back seat records perfectly right, or a very low footstead.
120 horses distributed on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should look like a 1.6 who makes a family hatchback walking.
He is silent, consumes little and, above all, he grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having an exhaust pot busted by a scratch, then I can only be excited about it.
Let's browse the prices
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by everyone.
However, we must be aware that a quite well-equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a Otto 1.4 liter engine up to 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
Now, we have arranged in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic sliding glasses, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
It’s a lot, but try to add additional equipment to the price of the Fabia and you’ll get a very similar figure.
So there is only one thing left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is bad
The number of children originating in eastern Europe countries in British schools is growing, causing concerns in residents about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently struggling with a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases in which conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous people turn into violence.
The case of the North Kent, where the opposition conflicts of Slovak origin and immigrants begin to intensify, illustrates well the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicane and baggages between students have translated into the relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who struck a ten-year-old student with a iron bar.
The guilty defends himself by affirming that the boy had insulted him by racist words.
Police also had to intervene after the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two adolescents.
The young girls claimed to have addressed racist comments to this man and thrown stones to him.
“When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started crashing us on it.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and potatoes and then he discovered his feces," she described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
The complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went to qualify conflicts with immigrants fighting for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the indigenous people and immigrants begins to be tired.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in the UK.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be done if you make a good choice.
Gold and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a stain.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or a lot of inviting cocktails.
kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Islands, you will find this list not only in its entirety, but enriched.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
During the Spanish times, Cuba was the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb qualified him as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and place of transfer of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the U.S. mafia, made him build, because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, random games, prostitution.
Among its customers, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, heightened buildings rose and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s of the past century, circulated on the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and politicians across America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the hotel's hotel bar, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, as the Jigulis and ancient fiats have been imported for a long time in such a salt and wet climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is considerably decreased, there are nowhere else around as many magnificent colonial monuments as there is exactly there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have not only raised in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and will be appreciated especially by small train lovers.
The cane had come back from the plants extended into the sugars on a narrow path through small steam trains and motor trains.
Their rolling equipment has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see small locomotives, whose contemporaries are in museums only elsewhere.
Where to guide his steps?
Most visitors don’t miss the most famous places.
There is no need to write long on Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation and grows on a calcair soil.
Mogs, calcare balloons, and rocks rise up to the lightning of the bottom of the valley, and from the fertile land taken into their innermost, even its porous rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable cover.
The valley is the place where you probably grow Cuban tobacco of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana cigarette factories.
Someone might also find interesting that it was the Chilean episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
It is the trade of slaves and the trade of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth has embedded in the beauty and the city-wide character of this small-sized city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mass mountainous Escambray, is a place so far away that in the 1950s, there was no way to connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
They did not build anything, so they did not demolished anything, each of them had a roof above their heads.
If we have more time in Trinidad than a afternoon, then it is also worth going to see interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Musica, which animates after the sunset and where the music was only asleep in the morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this bourgeoisie located in the outermost east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
Both roads that run from Guantánamo must cross high and accidental mountains and pass through a landscape almost without signs of human activity.
UNESCO has registered the eagle of Eastern Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the world heritage list.
There is the best chocolate in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, she saw about a hundred years after the Colomb perimeter) and from the hill where the old castle-forth and the current El Castillo hotel, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rhum, cigarettes, Sierra Maestra mountain massif, the Bay of the Trees and the island of Isla de Pinos, the cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the saint patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the ancient slaves, about this could fill a quantity of pages
Just as we say rightly, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment affects the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place as it should, and the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the increasing controversy of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States this week called NATO troops to a larger activity by Defence Minister Robert Gates, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government’s authority and the intensification of development aid.
“Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other side is to allow people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves,” the British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC channel.
Ninety-nine percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels, according to the U.S. Army, has been the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, up to 60 percent in the province of Helmand, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, including about a quarter in the southern part.
But, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limits both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We must seriously think about the specific goals for the next period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has held similar speeches today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would last three days.
Who is passive
Over the past few months, conflicts have also occurred between the countries involved in the issue of whether all allies actually do their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun qualified the German soldiers of parseous this week.
"The Afghan fans discovered: the Germans are playing while ours are fighting," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counter-attack by publishing the photo of a British troops during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will increase to a billion in 2009
The burden of a State debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is liable to each Czech Republic.
The total debt was raised at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion krones this year.
Thanks to the development of state savings better than expected, the Ministry has reduced the expected amount to 152.8 billion.
The debt of the state of the Czech Republic rose to the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its state debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is in charge for each Czech Republic.
Over the past year, the state owed over 111 billion crowns.
"For the moment, it seems that, thanks to a less significant deficit for next year, we could only exceed the border of a billion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion crowns,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told the iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor predicts that "we could exceed the billion by 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that is still unknown.
If it seemed that the situation on the political stage was changing, that politics were ready to saving more, the date could be repealed in 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debt Growing
State debt is constituted by the debt of the central government and is mainly caused by the accumulation of the deficits of the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasury bonds, interest bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The State’s domestic debt has increased this year from 38,5 billion to 719.4 billion.
The state’s external debt has increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The state debt called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion, and from June it declined by 13.7 billion.
The average government debt eligible was 6.5 years.
“The total debt has increased from the first to the third semester of 13 per cent annually, which is, given the current health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by interest securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, this indicates that there will be material to negotiate when the retirement reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than what was expected
The government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year as a result of the State funding and debt management strategy for 2007.
At the beginning of September, thanks to the development of state savings better than expected, the ministry reduced the expected amount to 152.8 billion.
The amount is essentially constituted by the state deficit, which is apparently going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of 91.3 billion crowns initially planned.
The Czech consolidation agency will then provide a maximum of 13.3 billion crore, a reserve of 10 billion for retirement payments, the funding of state interest bonds for 43 billion crore and the refunds of loans from the European Investment Bank to 1.8 billion crore.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum for appointment of a peach bear
The British teacher sentenced to Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison and expulsion by a Khartoum court on Thursday night.
The British was accused of leaving students aged 6 to 7 to give the name of Mahomet to a pebble bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was passionate for a punishment of punishment.
The 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with prosecution and sedition in accordance with article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of students at the Ministry of Education in Sudan.
The story actually comes back in September, when the teacher asks his 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the pebble bears in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no labels with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered a insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked children to vote for a name,” it is just a “innocence.”
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as “very careful to her students” and “who never speaks of religion in class.”
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honour the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
Of course, this is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province, during the last negotiations session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
Serbians and Albanians of Kosovo concluded Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without having been able to overcome their divergence on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Strengthening that peace in the region was “in play,” his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We don’t plan violence immediately but we enter into a very difficult period,” he added, pointing out that “often tensions exist.”
The end of the mediation on December 10
The mediators of the Troika, which group the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last go to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will send their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
Baden’s discussions near Vienna were the sixth and last negotiations session since the troika was charged with a new mediation by the United Nations in August last year.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the appointment of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that date.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of Kosovo’s U.S. administration, the West considers independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council is not in favour of it.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” Kosovo’s President of Autonomous Authority Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the hotel in Baden, where these “last chance negotiations have been held since Monday.”
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, reported his regrets.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade “ belonged to a past that led to murder and deportation.”
"Effet domino"
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was still envisageable, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says fearing a “domino effect” in a region still fragile by the 1990s independence wars.
“For Serbia, it does not mean that compromise is impossible,” he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should come back exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian allies have a veto right.
“The parliament of Kosovo will have the last word”
“Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations took two years.
They must end the way they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told journalists that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian speakers would be “in consultation” with the West.
Bush withdraws an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference meeting on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israeli and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final solution to the 60-year-old contentious between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorism infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations in respect of the "road sheet" for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided by Abbas would aim to "conclude a peace treaty solving all issues in suspense, without exception, including central issues".
This name covers the three epic problems in the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian continent: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were driven out of their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after U.S. President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations would be "global and thorough" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others."
In turn, Olmert committed to the future talks to be "direct and continuous" and to make "a effort to blow them into the current of 2008".
Bush fixed at the end of 2008 the deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli states" that co-existent.
Saudi Arabia revealed that she had made a commitment to Bush in this sense before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is originally a plan endowed by all Arab countries, which offers to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 War, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a carrefour in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his interview to Saudi capital newspaper.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened Sunday?
As every time in this type of different facts, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspection General (IGPN), a police car circulated Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, in Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," a police source explains.
A green bike of the Kawazaki brand, “un-approval, therefore not authorised to circulate on the public road” (see below) and driven by two young people without casks, circulated “a very lively walk”.
"She hit the police car on her left, after a denial of priority right," a police officer said.
The control of alcoholism on vehicle occupants has proved negative.
The state of the car (forward dismantled, star-eyed, pulled-eyed) witnesses the shock violence.
Very quickly, last morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into "involuntary murder and non-personal hazardous assistance" to the IGPN, in charge of the Department of Public Security of Val d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor clarified that the IPN investigation at this stage was excluded from the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday evening, confirmed “the police version, namely that this mini-moto has arrived relatively quickly on their left.”
Yesterday, a kind of rain, probably caused by the flood of foots on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained overwhelmed as long as the police car was able to brake.
Vehicles have been captured and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, saying that the police would soon leave the places, so not lending help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also deviate “all serious mistakes” in this matter.
“This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we need to be very careful,” a police source said.
The release encountered an eye witness of those few moments following the accident.
One of his windows look precisely on the scene.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is nurse in the hospital, to try to rain them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely hagared policeman who was drinking.
Two others were trying to reanimate one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surround the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that the people present in the unexpected situation of young people, the police were driven by colleagues arriving in places.
According to the witness, the rescue came “about 20 minutes after the police left.”
They also practiced heart massages in vain.
“I won’t let you say that the police haven’t helped young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right now.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
The tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed Monday the first demonstrations since the initiation of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken in the emergency state were injured by the lacrymogenous grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by jets of stones, injuring police.
At least 350 lawyers were interpelled.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or policemen loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interpelled.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement collected on Monday the support of religious parties in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president has "exhorted the population to send flowers to judges who have pronounced against the state of emergency and destruction to those who have sworn in before Musharraf."
“Musharraf’s promise will no longer keep.”
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly referred to by the exception measure announced on Saturday evening.
She had to pronounce in the coming days on the legality of the reelection to the presidential election on October 6, with the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
"Everything we attend is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's judgments," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and to become a civilian president 'there' takes place after the emergence state was initiated, deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform until November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be delayed.
Moreover, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy army commander.
More than one-third of pregnancy remains unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the voting of the Neuwirth Act which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Different contraceptive methods such as pill or sterile still have a 5% to 6% failure rate, the Ined estimates.
Nevertheless, contraceptive liberalization has enabled a better “fertility control” according to the institute, which notes that the pill use rate in women between 20 and 44 years of age has increased from 5 % in 1970 to 60 % today.
Finally, eight in ten births would be well planned today.
Also calculated in the near month for a couple out of five and if possible in the spring, the season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours to work in space by astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew comrades at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, which is essential for continuing the scientific activities of the station.
A risky outlet that accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the "bricled" tools by the astronauts to carry out repairs.
The problem appeared on Tuesday while astronauts had discharged the Harmony module from the Discovery navette, a large cylinder piece to soon welcome European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frame).
This module is a kind of adapter for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to move a solar panel electricity production module weighing 1.7.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew started the redistribution of the solar panels of the module that have a 76-meter angle.
And that's where one of the panels, which deploy as an accordion, has been damaged on nearly a meter by a cable that has been locked.
The deployment has been stopped in order not to harm the panel further.
The astronauts, who initially had to carry out a control exit from the Discovery navette, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defected, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracole after the 30 meters length of the remote controlled arm added to the station to make repairs.
It is one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
Large, resistant, very place, it has the toast very developed and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician was responsible for “operating” the solar panel “injured”.
After precisely inspected the damage, he cut off the faucet cable and installed types of "adhesives" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second spacewalker staying near hiss and, inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, an isolated hockey mini-can, to avoid electricity cutting on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “bricoled” by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and recovering the station inside.
Last afternoon, astronauts enjoyed a half-day relaxation before today, seven astronauts regain Discovery for a scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS in Stock Exchange
The EADS is currently falling down on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Air Force and Defence Group announced it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% at 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational outcome forecast for 2007 due to the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to palliate the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the home of the European manufacturer EADS said.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operational results goals (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new loads is consistent with the delay of six months.
To recall, the EADS’ operational result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the delays of another programme, the A380’s very large carrier.
Initially, the group intended a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the release of the urnes: the Russians will opt massively for the President Putin’s party, Russia.
Confirmating their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
At three days of the election, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addresses voters a television message on public channels, already recorded but the contents of which are kept secret.
He does this as the head of the unified Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is declared to be devastating.
Yesterday, the president left nothing clear by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely sending a new charge against the West accused of intervention - his theme of preference during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, most transparent and most open elections, no-contact elections,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
She denounced a pressing campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said there had never been such dirty elections, even in the era of Eltsine.
After the repression of last weekend's protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains forbidden to visit his lawyer.
"Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet Homo"
Behind these unstoppable legislations, two more open issues are discussed:
- Who's going to happen to Putin at the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the presidential tour, March 2, 2008; candidates had up to December 23 to get acquainted.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot fight a third consecutive mandate.
There is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of the entire powerful Russian unified party who would choose the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative and in the presidential election, the outgoing power will win.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet Homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny,” said Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin resumed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population of more than this new paternalism was followed not by terrorism, but by a certain economic assault,” says Maria Lipman from the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “refuse full freedom from personal responsibility” which they had briefly proved after the exile of the Soviet Union.
"What is good to think about?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of business.
And the administrative elite aims to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of the United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
The conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: “What is good to think about?
Those who are in power aren’t too bad, why to change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which retract the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored on 27 km line at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far consultable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, on request of a former victim or its rights holders.
The eleven states responsible for their management - Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research on “especially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers,” says Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the public opening of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest mandates established by the Gestapo after war were gathered for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subject to compulsory work and, if possible, to provide evidence of their internality in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Dr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Anti-Semitism Research at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly €60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given their green light to the European Commission last April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian nations (Asean). The bilateral trade in India reaches nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the ninth trade partner of the EU, according to the European Commission figures.
"A free trade pact significantly deployed both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of assets" and for "10 billion euros of services" and "Singmo" for "10 billion euros of services", said this week President of the European Union came up with the presence of President President of the European Commission, Daniel Smadja's next week.

The Bank of England raises concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England was worried on Thursday to alleviate the current return of credit conditions concerns, and announced a £10 billion offer at the base rate of 5.75% in five weeks, an unusual period of time.
"In order to relieve the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly close at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its scheduled reserves during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in a market-to-operate form."
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and up to 10 January.
This seems to be the first time BoE puts on the five-week liquidity market in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it is "prepared to take further measures to maintain the interest rates" of interbank loans online daily with its base rate.
The interbank rate of day to day was Wednesday 5,829%.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, a higher since September 18th.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had dissuaded banks from using it.
According to some rumors, confirmed by the evolution of the book course compared to the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the proposal for a socialist law on purchasing power, equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (seat at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS National Office, among which the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the rental framework.
UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was lifted following the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes live, between a majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
Chairman of the PS MPs Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending financial bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival looks at the day
Following many rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn’s Festival.
“For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has, no more or less, inspired the current movement of the festivals in America,” Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres at about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the Reading Festival bar in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been responsible for producing, granting licenses and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which can now host up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, Charlie Jones from C3 says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival.
“We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city center of Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic by this project.
Unfortunately, we have been engaged in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“Fortunately, we have been able to talk to Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the population of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after taking part in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the middle of the city.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a field festival, while ours are rather in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to fusion both formulas in one way or another to give both an impression of European and urban festival to Americans.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the tenure of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says “that they are interesting enough to allow for investment in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life.”
Charlie Jones says the hostability of this festival is “very great,” like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said invitations were launched to the groups, but nothing could still be confirmed at the time of press release.
"Vineland will taste rock, but music will be varied there, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montréal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film plates to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of the delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denotes "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the "Governator" legs?
“We need to be careful, the industry decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best,” he said.
The Festival Race
However, Denis Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be from all festivals in the West Coast, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the issue of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful vitrine at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the show at Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally in the end of the year in stock exchange? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis?
Less than five weeks after the end of the year, investors are already shaking their hands in expecting the arrival of the traditional rally in the end of the year.
However, this year, experts are not as sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that “from the statistical point of view, the month of December in exchange usually has a positive behaviour.
However, predictions should not be made exclusively based on statistics, as, given the current context, market uncertainties, at least in the short term."
Although they are not supportive for the exchange to take the balance over the last few weeks of the year, these experts say that "the exchange market is feeding due to the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, particularly fixed income, affected by the effect of escape in long periods as well as in quality values".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely falling rates of the Fed, given the high level of gross and the risk of inflationist tensions stimulating."
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that it’s not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“That’s not the best thing,” the expert says.
The Ibex, the Spanish scholarship index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have this vision so negative.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension regimes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the nuance expert that things will be slightly different this year as he believes the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitutional Party (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "this is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused by information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, of Intermoney, claims that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include the two major banks and some manufacturers in the portfolio "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, assures that heights will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they are placed there.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert said.
The cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological companies will do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions the month of December was a small month.
The authentic rally of the end of the year took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the perception of the technological ball.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, in December, a 6.68% rise.
You will need to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment, Ibex has increased by 8.36 percent since January) and if it succeeds in computering on its rally at the end of the year.
The Banque Popular will open 200 offices open 12 hours Monday to Saturday
The People’s Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These subsidiaries, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, as it was the first group to start betting on the interrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open Saturday from 10:00 to 20:30.
Another group that has also repeated several times that he would like to enlarge the schedules of his subsidiaries, BBVA, even though he has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other agencies to join this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is exactly what the People’s Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and the street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies that are implanted across Spain in about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new agencies but the renovation of existing agencies.
For this purpose, the organization will modernize the subsidiaries it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the different streets.
In this way, the amplifier of time is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the subsidiary and a new, more up-to-date design, with brighter colors.
Banking manager, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but employee recruitment, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The National Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as explains Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the Murillo Brave streets, O'Donnell and the Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The National Bank currently owns 2,500 subsidiaries.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very extensive schedules, which open even Sunday and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies, they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero notes.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff to the bank.
Telecinco double value for the first time in Stock Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco delegated adviser, expressed his satisfaction at the close of the exchange market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A unique aspect of his joy was terrifying: “What hurts me is not the fact that we were more increased, but that we were less lower,” he said.
However, he emphasized that in a low market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended the day with a 2.54% progress.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% for a year.
The company’s Stock Exchange (with 52 percent of capital) and Vocento (with 13 percent additional) value is thus €4,88 million, according to Bloomberg’s data.
Its rival Antena 3, which last year fell 1.52% and accumulated a decline of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of other communication companies listed in the Stock Exchange is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we profitable it in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, as said Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the company that manages the group’s advertising.
In order to be real, the TV channel should record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising bill for the current year compared to 965.4 million for the year 2006.
In turn, the net invoice of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while the net revenue of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors analysts pointed out for Telecinco’s best relative evolution in Borse is the important pay out that he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of Endemol by 33% and in association with Mediaset.
" We have the official compromise to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to those to whom we have already given securities with 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market currently gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of profits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due to the decline in the estimated income growth from 10.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009.
The same company decreased Antenna’s 3 profit forecast to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

The Congress approves the transfer of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which has ended today with the vote of the Congress of Amendments included in the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of entering into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to emphasize the efforts made by the Members and Senators to negotiate and agree with the best regulations appropriate to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies in order for markets to function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Values Market Act, involves the modernisation of the financial markets, when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the National Values Market Commission (CNMV) leaders and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social reasons and to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which combine with value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of financial instrument operational systems increases, so that it can be added to regulated secondary markets to multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which are facing competition for current exchange managers.
The Law also obliges investment services companies to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risks and forms of risk management and obliges them to hold a record of all the transactions they perform, in order to facilitate CNMV’s control.
Through the Congress Economic Commission, several changes have been added, one of which highlights that debt securitized will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk for the investor, which has proven to be with what has happened with American high-risk debt (subprime).
In addition, they benefited from the transposition of the management to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics may have 30 years after, was approved in 1977, the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
In turn, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require permission from CNMV and who will be able to provide its products marketing and attraction services for new customers at the same time.
The Harmonized Consumption Price Index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which later serves at Eurostat to incorporate it in the calculation of inflation rates in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the changes in prices in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policies of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be disclosed on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue on relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the increase of IPC by 4.1% in November was a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes stated in the Congress's corridors that "although the figure is not good" the Spain's inflation differential about the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not face such a high increase.
“We expect a figure of about 4%,” the Minister of Economy acknowledged in comparison to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock €42,000 in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen to over 50% up to £12,000 million (€16,800 million) since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to apply for an emerging credit from the UK Bank.
At the moment, he had a few record deposits of over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months due to its customers’ unreliableness and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government offered and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the body with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to take about a quarter of British bank revenues that will be deposited in the next three years to get these 18,000 million pounds left to reach the 30,000 million goal.
The group of magnat Richard Branson, known for his advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock appointed this week the Virgin Association's offer, which includes three other companies, his favorite to save him from the banker.
Mayor of Totana has been arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcia municipality of Totana (the People's Party) in the early morning due to its alleged relationship with the urban corruption frame discovered this week.
ADe plus, one of the Secretarys of the Municipal Council and the Police Chief of the Municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May with Juan Morales, current Deputy of the Right, and until then municipal councillor of the Mayor, and which, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the ‘manager’ of this frame.
Officers continue to search the municipalities and the municipalities of the Urbanism Council and the possibility of new arrests will not be deprived in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales’ lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption tram, discovered at the beginning of this week, was accused.
As the SER Chain stated yesterday to the lawyer of the 'Popular Party' deputy Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales' home with important documentation in its possession of the frame.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged settlement of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalifie 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to be head of the Spanish Socialist Party candidate for Toledo and to preside Congress if they win the elections
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be head of the Spanish Socialist Party list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus, the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party with Zapatero.
The Chief of the Executive Officer justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono is "one of the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that La Manche's political man will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made his decision on November 15 not to attend the next general elections and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the university.
The former minister acknowledged that the government’s president had not stopped insisting that he would return to the political guard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that even if the citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the president of Congress in a "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or crying" and make it "they look more and more like citizens."
“Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only local Madrid where we can’t talk calmly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government at the Senate has been interrupted 26 times.”
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín, and "he knows how to do" and he did not want to do as if he was already occupied his position to not fall, as he noted, in what his opponents could be considered a "domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to unmerciful persecution both to the skeptics of its predictions and to those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate a coherence of iron.
This is more and more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach is obliged to explain why the action, or the inaction, of its Government, has made a decisive contribution to Spain as the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred, and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to prevent climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, what economic consequences will this cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay for saving the planet.
But there was no explanation and there would be no explanation.
Just because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Costless, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to the 100th of the fuel suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party, Zapatero seemed to be so literally dangerous that he was denied.
That is, it is to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that do not speak, denounce and do not require, embellish meetings and inspire tenderness.
If this is only limited to being a purely virtual contracting party who does not claim that we deploy on bike or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and Chief of the Local Police of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, head of the local police, the Mayor's secretary and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, reported sources of the investigation today.
The municipal adviser was arrested at his home and brought to the city hotel, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Consultant Office of Urbanism and the Municipal Management Company of the Industrial Sol and Logement.
These three arrests are added to the six arrests made on Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing, after paying illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which Totana Tribunal No. 1 instructed.
The first six prisoners have now been held in court.
According to sources, the former municipal adviser of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary of the PP Party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current bride of the former municipal adviser, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Vigo (Galice) lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the pots-de-vins were carried out.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, have carried out eleven inspections, the majority in detained companies located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So one person was arrested at Totana, the owner of a well-known bird product company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Totana Murcia Municipality, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing, a golf course and two hotels with spa.
The company acquired at Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would suppose to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is composed of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, who care about the promotion of real estate; Conycase, who manages the parking lots of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, who cares about direct marketing; Preconiza, who focuses on promotion, sale and installation.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us the commentary of yesterday published in Finland’s most important newspaper (certain PISA information over the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, who refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
“The contents of the Philosophy course interfered with public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela school.
The guilty of the dead, a bachelor’s student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Education Advisor for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in Helsingin Sanomat newspaper pages and he claimed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes information on the introduction in the Criminal Code on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal offence of a fine of six months to a year.
On the contrary, the flight in a CD store for a value of less than €400 is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for a value of up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and make it 40 hours later, the punishment is lower than that imposed for download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less important to participate in a baggage than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participation in a tumultuous crash implies a penalty of three months to a year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and trafficking of CDs implies a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without authorization by authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth, then someone exaggerates.

My doctor told me one of his articles on strange research entitled: ‘The money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.’
That is, that the feelings generated by the monthly payment of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted thanks to tomographic magnetic resonance at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed.”
The researchers observed that when both people assumed they were receiving the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Attorney of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has for eight years implicitely pursued the war criminals of the Balkans since the public ministry of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Tribunal, which is located in Hague.
His mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with a tasteful taste, because the main officials for the murder of Srebrenica - where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed -, former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list of which the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla' (2006, not exclusively projected in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, following the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York that pursues the escaped criminals and presses on the involvement of governments.
What insurance do I fit?
Auto insurance, which covers the driver in the face of accidents, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that choosing the proper vehicle insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the awarded premium and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is based on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be assured or used, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices based on statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident is, the higher the rate to pay.
This is why people over 25 years and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of crash than their caution.
In the same way, the companies have concluded that married people tend to have less accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probabilities increase.
These are many variables that insurers take into account at the time of setting the prize.
That’s why the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the auto insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing any type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age must face various disadvantages at the time of contracting a contract with an affordable insurance, such as the low experience in driving and age of the driving licence.
Although the ideal to be well-insured is any risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most predictable drivers can choose any risk insurance with franchise, so that they get the covers of an insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the fee.
"The part of the amount of the compensation paid to the customer will be established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher, the lower the amount will be," said Luis Noguera, chief of First Europa in Spain, online insurance mediator.
Another option is enlarged third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection to deal with damage caused to third-party, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you are less than 25 years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the insurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
“Bonus and sanctions will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company had a good year it would be able to increase the bonuses,” explains Noguera.
Over the age of 25 this becomes easier for drivers at the time of contracting with insurance, as the rate of disasters is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
This is why it is better to choose any risk insurance with franchise.
"Usually, young people can't benefit from the previous experience acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the fear of the novice.
However, if the client is married but does not have children yet, it is better to negotiate insurance at any risk, since its economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be people with the lowest casualty rate, as increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be any risk insurance with franchise (may be EUR 300), or third-party insurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more distracted conduct and have a greater purchase power to allow the luxury to assume a larger amount of franchises," judge Luis Noguera.
For retired persons, a risk insurance with franchise is better (in which it is EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It should be said that auto insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of any accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that is best suited to us according to our personal situation.
Celtic wants to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow are measured next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closure of the Champions League, as it serves Italians to be first and Scots to classify themselves.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified for the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who is six, and receives Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two D Group matches will be played a week before the sixth day is over, as the Milan AC must compete in the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the 16th December final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before no one at the stadium Giuseppe Meazza appears to be the most expected result, although both teams are trying to get out of victory, as the Italians won’t want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that winning will remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to classify if Shakhtar Donetsk won not, but will not only be able to computer on that because with nine points the games return to the Ukrainians, who lost last week at Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanians are trying to poison the evening to the Scots, who have a good hope to rank themselves for the eighth finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the prolongations (1-0).
While waiting for the 'rossoneri' victory, the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, if the Celtic would lose, to rank himself for the eighth finals to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before they started their concert at GM Place in Vancouver.
Around 20,000 people have exhausted tickets to attend the concert that made a video in which the story of the group that was angry in the late 1990s is told.
The meeting and tournament coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main success as well as two new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, published in Spain.
The five Spice Girls members are set on stage showing the arms that Posh Spice’s husband had offered to them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience full of the GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer “wasn’t seen our costumes so I’m nervous because I don’t know what he’s going to think about the show.”
Sporty Spice, who was part of the group in 1998 "due to the differences between us" and who caused the group dissolution two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of people changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I’m happy to have made a decision,” Chisholm said on the group’s meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "the things have been arranged and we appreciated a lot."
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls appeared for the last time in 1998.
To start, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane by Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibited in California (USA), San José (Dec. 4th) and Los Angeles (Dec. 5th and 7th).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is throwing out the alarm.
A dispute on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.S.) are transported by gas pipes, and each pipeline is closely monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases fuel costs, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supply to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian ownership monopoly company supplying gas, attempted in vain to find an agreement on the cost of the Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase as expected, its prices in Ukraine as he agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would mean for Ukraine a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during conversations, reminding us that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of the supply of Gazprom for Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a decline in exports to Western Europe, resulting in rising prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the EU's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas warehouses, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supply of gas from Turkmenistan and other countries of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health has to control its foreign employees.
The Scottish Ministry of Health must improve the controls to be carried out on its extra-Community employees to verify whether they have previous penalties, the Control Committee said.
The warning of the General Auditor, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
In addition, Mr. Black expressed his concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of foreigners it employs.
Its report, however, highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor conducted checks on extra-Community staff following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, at the doors of the main terminal.
He took part of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October because he was suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employed inspections on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks from previous criminals, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside the UK.
Among the many warnings, the report of the General Auditor now states that the committees are obliged to face the Bureau of the previous penalties, allowing employers to undertake controls on various countries.
“Although we have found that some information on staff has been well verified, this is not done every time,” the report said.
Mr. Black said the Scottish Ministry of Health is carrying out most of the pre-employed checks he would do himself, but he added: “Our report emphasizes aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on some foreign personnel is available to healthcare services.
Peter Terry, President of BMA of Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employed controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that pre-employed checks currently operate well in the Scottish health system and that it is uncertain that these warnings can bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
However, the Auditor-General emphasized that these figures must certainly be addressed to the rise, in part due to the problems relating to the identification of employees with an indefinite contract, which could choose or not, to stay in our country.
The survey has shown that the current sanitary control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite appropriate.
These checks are carried out on passport, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and pre-employment control system for staff outside the ocean of the healthcare service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Allied Government would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure a better implementation of recent and valid pre-employed checks for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio pic on Joy Division's latest singer, Ian Curts, won 5 awards, including the best film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also assigned to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was engaged in Curtis’ role in this film whose director is Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Ms. Judi Dench was appointed best actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandale"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under international reflectors.
The prizes were distributed during the London's Round House ceremony.
Control reports the rise of Curtis' success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, a 23-year-old.
The film in black and white, whose music band was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was toured with a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic coverage of the U2 album Joshua Tree, has won two awards, the first as the best scener and the second as the best starter scener.
The Rock was also awarded the best documentary award to Julien Temple on Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The best actress award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his interpretation of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, famous for his coriaces character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old filmmaker, who has played movies like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the following of Indiana Jones, the Kingdom of Crystal Crane.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of the star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney allowed people like me to have access to the cinema,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admirable in front of this great current actor, I was extremely honored.”
The Oscars of the Independent Film, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury composed of stagemakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia block 208 terrifying complots
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizational cells manipulating an imminent attack on a petroleum site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said it was one of the missile counterband cells.
Al Qaeda’s sympathists have launched a campaign against the United States’ allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell consisting of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly set up a 35,000 military group to protect sites, due to a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper cited a statement by the Interior Minister said that 18 of the arrested people belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
They said the militants had planned against eight missile bands in the kingdom.
22 people among the prisoners seemed to have complot the murder of ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The government called for ecclesiastics to do more against Saudi leaders in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Shiite Muslim Allied Government in the United States, considered to be heritage according to the hard line of Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiasts have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces in the last five... months,” state television spokesperson said.
Among the detained are 16 members of the Media organized in a “media cell” aimed at promoting the “takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and posted Muslims.
Among the prisoners, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the militants.
Venus’ climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was definitely a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European vessel in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as smaller than the Earth, unlike what we thought before.
Venus is the closest planet on Earth.
These two worlds are virtually the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and may even have been living.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiations alloyed to a slower rotation led Venus to any other type of evolution.
Today, the planet is water-free, ravaged by hurricanes and storms, and has a temperature surface hot enough to melt it.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's survey, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of Earth due to disastrous climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We begin to understand why Venus’ climate is so different from Earth’s, although planets in it are almost similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, can even be with a living surface.”
The uranium enriched by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovakia and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was well uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not at the height of the presidential candidate, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican candidates for the presidency finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters have recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions were as ridiculous as the result of another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position in relation to the warming of the planet.
But this time, the questions and answers have much reflected the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next election.
We don’t know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, have chosen You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest approach to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard pleasant things: The government raised highs of approval when the candidates expressed themselves grossly.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is heading for major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to emphasize the fact that he was accommodate about illegal immigration during his mandate of Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they were willing to promote an amnesia (to offer the clandestine a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressist, have managed to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, can be because they have started fighting immigration before and in a more incisive way than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same opinions: rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, allied with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears about the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between the Liberals and the Conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other topics have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water into the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the entire content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about believing the history of Jonas and the wave.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee was not expected to see - in polling position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - declaring that the death penalty is painful, though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he began laughing and said that Jesus is too chic to present himself in the elections.
The human race remains insolently open to everything.
The retreat of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research on subsidies conducted by liberal Ron Paul, and the sifflements during the debate on Wednesday.
Both of them emerged from the neanth, thanks to the fact that both protectors of the party are not able to agree to decide who is the most famous and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party of good time and in a convincing way thanks to a successful message on the U.S. greatness approaching the leaders.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
The pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shake; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this is not particularly sad.
No decorations sold, no Paris hotel bills of politicians, no soaked extra conjugal finger.
But this is a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have stated: a new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went back in his election project, stupidly insulting the British intelligence declaring that opinion surveys did not influence his decision, and that he hoped on the contrary to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble at the edge of crack, has demonstrated a lack of guidelines and a moderate judgment in emergency cases.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have caused a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of generals at retirement launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reduction of military expenditure: they declared that being Defence Minister is a part-time job for them.
Currently, the suspicion of loud donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labourists (and his former head of the Watchtower) have made them resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is imminently heading to the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but generally leave their doubts as a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister can't improve things, or even govern for a long time, while it risks the suspension: the public administration is no longer working; the cabinets of the ministers do the balance; the press searches for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any goal.
In one sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to rebuild Tony Blair, he was still his superior Lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s disasters, such as the long investigation into the funds of the party “the money counting for the members of the Lord’s Chamber,” voters might think the opposite.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown isn't so tragic as she looks like.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as members of the Tories party make it believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there is no victim or scrolling.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to implement Mr. Brown's Stalin trends always, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but he doesn’t have to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of major politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated to be aware of Mr. Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that this was illegal, would therefore be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the director of the collection of subsidies, who had spoken of doubtful donations in October.
But until now Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing lets him think he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments were made following his arrival to the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half.
He quickly convicted his party’s legislative failure, but he did not draw the attention that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, to use a committee of investigation on this subject consisting of a bishop to retire and a judge.
In this case, lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is from the police department.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the finance of political parties.
This would force the Working Party, at a time of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead him to renounce his particular financial relationship with the Confederations; in short, a bold pill for such a supporter Mr. Brown.
But he should face some supportive facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for elections; it is two years old to regain voters, and the only way to achieve a victory is to demonstrate an irreproachable integrity and solid skills.
Card scrolls.
Will the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see stirred swimmers, screwed around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market goes through a critical phase, predators target the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card-related losses could reach $99 billion if contagion extends from mortgage to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measure the non-recoverable or which are shares of the balance sheet, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly due to the weakness of card carriers.
It’s too early to panic.
Costs and insolvences are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point below its historical average.
Rate deterioration is partly explainable by technical factors.
A change in laws in the U.S. in 2005 regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sudden decline in bankruptcy archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the loan conditions had to deteriorate.
In addition, the industry announces fixed payment rates, which emphasize the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to adjust.
and trust in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market are certainly there: consumers may prefer to increase their taxes now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow rather than to the value of the property, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even provide benefits to credit securities issuers.
Consumer premiums for payment of mortgage fall if property costs less than the loan value; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority for repaying the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of rapid recovery of actions.
“We won’t wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, Director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there are strong risks of significant decline.
If the lower real estate prices and a constraint in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macable future.
Be careful with the back swimmers.
British bankers complain about the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were going to testify their roles in a fraud committed by Enron's previous financial director Andrew Fastow changed their statement, claiming guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven alleged collusion fraud charges committed by Fastow in a secret financial scroll to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should appear in the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared themselves guilty of having committed a fraud.
The three former directors of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout the UK due to extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a question of the investigation launched after the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought to them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was subject to government investigation in Enron's debris.
The charges against bankers, called the "three of Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him trigger bankruptcy procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank considered its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest from the subsidiary’s bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest to this company.
According to the accused, Fastow would falsely announce to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for his shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the allegations, bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspirations in Enron's debris.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures six-year imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper was imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after paying a $1 million guarantee each, causing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, banking in December 2001 after years of accounting truck, could no longer hide his billions of debt or even propose his bitter speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of dismissals, more than $60 billion of market value loss and more than $2 billion of loss for retirement plans.
Enron’s founder Kenneth Lay and former President-General Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling has been sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were denied due to her death due to a heart attack last year.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having enough fuel autonomy to fly free from Moscow to Los Angeles, is part of $54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
“It can transport up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if nobody really needs so many seats because it’s more than a family-run plane or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday, at the Millionaires’ Salon, a four-day consumer incentive orgy, which is held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to raise the interest of the new rich Russians for their varying products, ranging from akkao yachts to cars full of diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer screened a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.”
Thanks to a oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll into black gold, like Dallas.
“We lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and were deployed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior researcher from the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians emerge as the world’s largest expenditure.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas about the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealth consist of 103000 Russian billionaires worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank said in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived under the poverty threshold.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, this is why we are all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London’s jewelry.
She participated in the salon for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Jewelry Group of Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men deserve a fortune.”
Walking in the salon on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, claim to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Melle Yumatova, who dressed her high-cut dress like a veteran of the red tape like Joan Rivers.
The living room appears primarily to focus on the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers ready to make a bowl in the bowls to come to an immense warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum sofas, Mövenpick ice, custom billard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch Delf porcelain manufacturing factory, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue wheels made hand.
“It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
In fact, sellers here said that Russians with old capitals (10-15 years are too much according to Russian standards) have already passed from embracing logos to a sort of limited edition brand that could not be sold in the salon.
Despite this, thousands of people, millionaires, emitters of millionaires or tourists, arpen the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, CEO of King Koil Beds, said he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton embedded with gold wires.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cried alarm systems, also told him to sell to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The four set costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of autrush leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tyres,” Karapetian said.
It will definitely keep it in its garage containing 30 or 40 vehicles already.”
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if that’s not the case,” he said.
“There is more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of the Continental Alliance, a Russian property management company.
The company has built four stands representing the British telephone cabins, filled with lots of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire salon.
Passengers arrested for launching a lot of tickets, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the beautiful middle of this fake wealth or empowering a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unacceptable surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the evening of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the glass bay of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance that just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on the West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol came.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, reside in the 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo’s death, but they are confident, the results of toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which should allow to resolve this mysterious death that harassed the high ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant of police director Garry F. Mc Carthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tender," McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done everything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two sons of 14 and 11 years, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman of the Union County parquet, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo was killed due to an unauthorized surgery.
“It’s an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
The authorities said they had arrived at her home about 5 p.m.
and found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities haven't said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if a part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro where a fainted rosier rests in the close cemetery front, and a Dalmatian bowed back.
A blue bidon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and perfume, climbed in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bicycles all land attached on the coasts.
McCarthy said 25 years ago since she arrived in Newark, Ms. Arroyo was extremely precious in the New York Police Department, helping her navigate into the new city and abandoning her framed political culture.
"She said, "you must pay attention to this," she told me.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
“It was a shame.”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the interest rates associated with the global stock exchange effervescence.
The stocks are exploded from the two Atlantic coasts yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down credit conditions, reducing interest rates further promoted by the calming statements of the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
Exchange markets explode in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide should be “flexibly and pragmatic” in their shares in troubled financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence has partially "inversed some improvements in the operation of the market at the end of September and October.
If this turbulence had to persist, it would increase the likelihood of a subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the U.S. markets, and that subsequent decreasing interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These comments also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest fall in real estate sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial tumultuousness have been increased following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will dismiss 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for heavy losses due to bets losers of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, i.e. 2.55% concluding to 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% concluding to 6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 decreased 2.3%.
Earlier, the emergence of loan difficulties in the markets was reliefed as a result of the high demand for a monthly selling out of the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heaviest 4.7% rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the British Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and further funds in London’s financial markets causing loan tensions, led to the monthly “Libor” loan rates by British banks, causing their highest growth since September last, at 6.59% following a high rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal against Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara’s critics.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 fighter for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the Chairman-General of England, begins to fill the candidate forms to become a national selector, at least in part.
Whoever won the 6th doll will be unfair, but life is often unfair, and sport is also.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by lack of skill.
There is not only cricket that selection is difficult, because at the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to get Bopara out?
Is it just compared to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new cadres having obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless given to him at least one chance?
The figures have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a battling must be lucky to touch the cricketer one day.
But catching the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison would appear in full form and continue to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors in 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both of them have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and are hoping to offer.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play in the Asgiriya stadium, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but this makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played each Test and succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 useful tours, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double-hundred against Australia in Australia still could be.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after the Asgiriya session today, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah's greatest experience against the young Bopara exclusion.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88-year-old Test in Bombay, 32-year-old first-class cents versus six for Bopara, who is 22-year-old seven years younger, and his excellent launch ranking.
But Shah did only ten turns during his two innings against the Caribbean in May during the Test at Lord, his city of Middlesex player, and that, immediately rejected by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, claiming his place for the next match, seems to have shaken his eagerness so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scared him on a cricket field and he was overwhelmed when he recently crashed on a 4x4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He just resigned from slight injuries, was shocked, even if the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his crew who looked at him from far away, to ask him, “had he seen this?”
Bopara is far away the best fighter, his filing wing allows him to do the services he goes to, and he beat with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can this be the true art of selection?
I would be willing to give his luck to Bopara, which doesn't mean Shah shouldn't apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it's him who will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work and fight against al-Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, devouring these exiles without money or no visa renewal, or others who hope the city will find normal.
Some have come back to fight the militants who have taken them away from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in dozens of bus convoys of the official government, the terminal was filled with Syrian and Jordan refugees who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I went home today because I saw TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is more secure now.”
“They say that the Mahdi Army does no more crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastic militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to get away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, came home with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called her to inform her that the U.S.-assisted militia allowed her to hunt Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited her to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe, who had to leave his home north of Baghdad due to an attack on the grenade after he incited the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to have set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“This is why I go home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the increasing accalemia of the capital since the U.S. troops arrived, and in the view of continuing training of well-armed “groups of involved citizens” and collaborating with U.S. troops to defend their neighbourhood.
But others say they have been forced to return home due to the visa problem and the decline in the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three children, expressed the alleged suspicion of visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, had asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two million and a half people would have fled from the country because of the sectarian escadrons of death.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki comes to Syria and encourages the government to no longer give visa to Iraqis to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni retirement said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunni were kidnapped from the areas of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will again increase sectary tensions and bring back fights.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state leads in vocational training, and even shine through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in a field that a deficit lies on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
“I explained to a non-Sarrois for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French,” the slogan is that the smallest federal state, by self-determination, is posted for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is the fifth in the monitoring of the training of the German Institute of Economics of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools work closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double, or even a triple degree.
The high quota is 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads children from the country to higher schools in an average — many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
“In Sarre, we benefit from the professional training system,” says Axel Plünnecke, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five youth gets a degree in a vocational school, so the Sarre is located at more than seven points above the national average.
Also, the possibilities of combination of vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Due to the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Sarrois Education forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in the field of engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a large number of reforms in public schools," a spokeswoman of the Ministry of Education said.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to begin learning earlier, the last year of crash is free of law - a model that other federal states have copied as well.
Only future comparison studies will be able to show if students’ performance is improving in a sustainable manner.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the number of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians get out of it better.
And despite large sarroses, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbour is mandatory in high schools - even though the sarrois are not French.
Choose to regulate the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tic-tact differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will lift the half-hour chronometer in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain from time to time.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela announced, due to a new law, the watches will be set at least four hours and a half of the universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States had imposed the world’s segregation of full-time time zones.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with neighbouring country, Colombia, due to an occupational affair.
The left nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is eager to make a constitutional reform on which citizens of the oil country will have to vote by a Sunday referendum.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw the Chavez mandate of negotiations on the release of refugees with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "craved" Venezuela's face with this decision, he had criticized Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is also in all mouths.
A new mobile phone sound is angry in the country: "Why no te callas" (why you don't quiet) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the internet.
She was pronounced by King Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angry with the constant interpellations of the left-wing populists and who told him to quiet.
The decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjunction, according to a prediction, a real less-value of salary threatens German workers this year.
Experts have mentioned all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimist prediction.
According to a calculation from the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect in 2007 a real reduction in their wage figure compared to the previous year.
“The fault is due to the low salary development, the increase in added value tax and the rise in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncture Research, in the journal “Bild”.
There may also be new burdens in terms of unemployment insurance for the employees.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected unemployment insurance decrease by 3.3% for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to seek credit or financial aid from the Federation, according to the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion of food prices and hydrocarbons has raised inflation rates at its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices rose by 3.0% from one year to another.
Venus is the infernal twin on Earth.
In spite of its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" discovered lights in the atmosphere and windstorms in the poles, similar to those appearing in the winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed there are lights on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe today has proved - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus climbing at an altitude of approximately 56 kilometers of cloudy cloud, Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles reported in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous Cyprine theory, lights would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that have led to the formation of amino acids, a cornerstone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If life had been there, it must have been a very old date of history," Sean Solomon from the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington explains.
Today there should be few things living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is approximately 100 times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but she remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The departure of Venus Express in November 2005 was an important step in Venice research, since no survey was on the way to the exploration of this planet since the 1980s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" not only emphasize the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than expected at first point.
Thus, researchers found, in addition to the wind bubbles already known to the north pole, a cloud bubble in the south pole, which turns even faster.
The phenomenon reminds the air flows in the earth's hemispheres in winter, a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The classified planet as a star of evening or morning turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: one Venetian day lasts 243 terrestrial days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, rarely reminds the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were in similar conditions.
On both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in the space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide was fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the dispute of the parties about the reception of Dalai Lama to the Chancellor.
Indirectly, he criticized SPDs due to attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and summons the great coalition to close the dispute about the Dalai Lama reception.
"We should not present a nation divided on this issue to the outside world," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed the understanding of Dalai Lama's welcome by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Men’s rights have universal validity, even if I respect the differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, he stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against reproaches that it would organize a new China policy.
The German Chancellor did not take its distances with the traditional politics of only one China.
“China knows it too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly informed his dissatisfaction with the reception of Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU ranks.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, of the CDU's "prejudice policy" on foreign policy.
After Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellor, virulent irritation caused in Germano-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government has not only uncovered the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to Spiegel’s information, has also frozen the said dialogue on the strategy of foreign ministers of both countries.
China’s head of government Wen Jiabao now calls for German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that Dalai Lama’s reception was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive Tibet’s spiritual leader in its official roles, supporting the Chinese position of Wen Jiabao.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama would show that it tries to separate Tibet from China and other Tibet regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against emancipations like those of France.
Street fights with police, shooting, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the warnings like those of France.
Everything must be implemented so that social disagreement in Germany does not climb in the streets by violence, the German Interior Minister said.
Burning barricades, kidnappers shooting on police with hunting guns: after the severe kidnapping of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must make sure that a social explosive does not constitute itself as well at home and distress itself in violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he said to the “Neue Presse” that appeared in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to get out of it with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the municipalities were already working firmly to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
“From summits of integration to conferences on Islam, this already shows its first success.”
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble notes at the same time that in the German regions, there are no sociological problems, nor from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Paris aggregations, young people had taken serious street battles with the police last night.
In Toulouse also, public cars and buildings were burned.
With the greater efforts of integration by the German government, this is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, required.
Due to the shocks in France, Kolat warned against the "imitative effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes the fact that the unemployed rate of young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
First of all, it is necessary to provide more places for training.
Kolat insisted, “We have to give young people a perspective.”
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that more social control in the families took place in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration don’t want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged: “But we must still be careful.”
It should be “speaked to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training”.
Meanwhile, in the Paris faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with projectors.
The officials reported three arrests as well as a few cars and bubbles burned.
Since the conference, the deployment of approximately 1000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will interfere as long as necessary, said Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the raids in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles passed over to Toulouse.
The emudes glanced after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the Parquet's first elements, police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor's utopical stage entry shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and there's nothing to expect from her anymore.
In what country does this Chancellor live rightly?
After his desperate intervention in the general debates of the German parliament, which was chaotic and poor content, we must say: not here - not in the country that, in the end, should be governed by it.
The reproach of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel from a hard and presumptuous phrase.
It’s provincial, she said, and she just showed that she doesn’t want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it has made everyone visible to the extent that this reproach was accurate.
There was neither concrete nor short feelings of interest for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela appeared as a cloud: a politician in support, who fled in foreign policy and even stayed there in the nearby.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, she welcomes again and again Heiligendam's agreements, but does not say how climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of himself - having as little modesty, the head of the CDU would have rejected it two years ago.
Now it cramps on all formulas made, that growth would affect people.
It destroys her image of pragmatist, which solves problems rather than embellish the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low wages workers?
There are still a few additional phrases for this.
In this regard, it reveals the number of times it makes laps when it comes to family allocation.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-precised phrase.
She tits in an unknown land, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican candidates to the presidential, both favored Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and now have to be afraid of an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestins," said Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I'd say his own house was a clandestine haughty," Giuliani replied and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for employing paperless immigrants.
Candidates go to the attack: as the Republican base does not have official favours, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than sophists.
"This is with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain lanced to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also makes the lesson vigorously by Vietnamese veterans, when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where the noyade is simulated.
However, the fact that important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the Iraq war and debates on torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are rented or future tax increases are rejected, apologies are deferred in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are residing again.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney said, and excuse the base and the television audience for having been another advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes into a flowing node when asked him his opinion on literal Bible interpretations.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as the commander of the army, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of army domination ended.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year mandate.
Pakistani television retransmitted the ceremony to the President's palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
He had transferred his army command to his trustee, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus pleaded with international pressure, including the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a non-blood putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as a head of civilian state.
With this withdrawal of the commander position as head of the armed forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf declared on November 3.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers in its ranks, had rejected last week all appeals against the controversial reelection of the head of state on October 6.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four other injured.
According to the army spokeswoman, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are returning.
Germany’s supergroups in the 1970s rejuvenated: the three members of the Harmonia Group took their console again at a concert in Berlin.
For their return, there are records of their great success "Live 1974".
At that time, they were far more known abroad.
The predicted sensation then occurs in the form of three masters announced at the evening show.
Each one has his little boot in front of him, his cable, and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
To the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, runs on his console.
Everybody contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is added by inadvertence to a piece of traditional music.
This doesn’t seem too much to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again ensured some emotions among the amateurs of Krautrock.
You have the right to disclose it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so durable that this group is also painfully missing for 32 years.
But why wouldn’t the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends in the 1960s?
More than what is called "Krautrock" has always enjoyed more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work, the German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pan-gyrotic praise, the surprise had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only and only one.
The memory is from this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and only during this period the impact power that felt was much lower than what was assigned to him later by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the caves under the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidised by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly deployed Kraftwerk and finally made himself a name as a guitarist with Neu!, who at the time was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's exile musicians in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Commune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to torture himself as a nurse.
Instead, an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
The so-called seeds were in the puppy a fan of the Harmonia Ottenstein chorale and also a name for art.
Many keep Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and fashionable as music sounds, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve him alone in search of himself.
The CD "Live 1974" just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone thinks to remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to exercise from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (in flames).
Cluster reanimated in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
We have to play the live album of Griessem by Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Grönland has set its goal to play Krautrock as a German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been deterred at this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of Cultures of the World in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor, Dr. Motte.
Through which the entire fluctuation margin of the influence of Krautrock would be dedicated to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be completed by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase in the room in the middle of individual sounds: “The only true music, you’re listening to the future.”
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of bazar cabled tools are used for the formation of the legend.
The three veterans are again occupied to improvise.
But more by clinging from microphones to the orge and battery, to shoot instruments of unnoised sounds thanks to instruments with self-built effects.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in great technical figs.
In this case, even the house’s choral will not change.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we climb and shook under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never rock.
Roots have been less searched in blues than in music conservatorys (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls "68" is not completely wrong, and Harmonia is no longer allowed to be irritated by this now.
But what goes most of itself will be carefully covered on the scene.
Where does music start and where does it end?
This can strike on someone’s nerves (?) or give escape moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynic.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mommy Peace," two films again address the Balkan war.
But both of them are not convinced.
Or the projects are too much based on action and on stupid shooting exchanges, or on the contrary, they are too lazy.
Even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: Karadzic and Mladic’s war criminals are always hiding in the Balkans mountains, but it’s right there, in the rear country of the Bosnian War, where actor Richard Gere was then found.
We had last lost the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nice and funny roles in feeling films for women and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism enjoyed his desire to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch “The Hunting Party” - when the hunter becomes hunted (why should today’s films be as long and confused as collective locomotive driver conventions?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of clinches: at the bottom, his war reporter character Simon Hunt was what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not as good as well: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruin to his decree, still kept his sights.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues along with the German production "Paix Killer", which also comes out this week, the infinite sequence of lost films on the Balkans War.
The film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian of the Kosovar francs, in which one of the two falls in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are here not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this flat film as a television film loses too quickly in action and sharing senseless shootings.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at the bottom there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who conditioned themselves to track the high war criminal "the renard", maybe could have become, with another director and another scenarioist (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories look strikingly: two males go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something the military cannot do and for both males, this becomes a trip to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also assign him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all world prime hunters have failed in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for fair revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the Hague International Court of Crime against Cinema Logic should be arrested.
In this case, the film has too deep human concerns.
He wants to claim that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects that Americans and French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) do not drive the hunt in an intense way enough due to secret political agreements.
But the intentional good and the evil are so similar this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to our mind.
He talks about a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionably, I see the veins of the inflamed front, clearly: how tired it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have precisely such tumescent heads, but which insinuate how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies on the Balkans war.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
It can be added: there have never been good movies in South Africa before.
What is worth every time: when a star draws on a crisis home or on a mine field, he then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits going Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood can play a good film on the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films still have to mature - those who are currently worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unanimously at their time as masters of work.
But maybe we know that today just too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this reassured the scripts the lack of scrupules they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" have actually become as good as Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you should have a sarcastic and distant artistic look from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historic novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan war, he replied, "It only holds the fact that some things never change."
“Great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be killed in a terrible way and the war will always rule in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust collects criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The decline of the mayor with Hamburg's nomination for the Summer Olympics has collapsed in politics and economy with critical virulents.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games on the edge of the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in appreciation of chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the Chief Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, described a resignation on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy."
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivation forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
Without this goal, the political-sporous elephant could not have been maintained in the same measure.
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate to not enter the project, but to find him a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic by at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides about a candidate for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports at the beginning of December, about the Munich candidate for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, within the time we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not belong definitively to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
This would be the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to close an opportunity by buriing projects already now,” said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A resignation of the candidate would be more in contradiction with the statements of the Senator at the occasion of the plenary meeting of the German Federation of High Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's 2015 universities candidate as "not a substitute" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
The Federation of High Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor reproached the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because he played the Olympics map and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always requested for the Small Grasbrook a plan integrated into the Olympics and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the Event factor.
The 2012 Summer Olympics candidate would, for his part, have raised a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg broke against Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden boxes, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or if?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden throw shadows on the Warhol works list.
Most of the eighty Brillo-Boxs listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had doubted the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museum of Stockholm today leads to a disgusting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the 1995 Brillo-Boxes are the "Brillo's portion" of the 1995, the former museum director of the Pontus Hulten's
Ancient history is overwhelmed, a chain of artistic and curatory productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
A exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museum presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of carton: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were directly delivered from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not here artworks, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had well granted permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museum.
Witnesses of the time today talk about about fifteen wooden boxes that would then be entering law in the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum, wrongly claimed that approximately a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would have subsequently assigned to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator of the Moderna Museum, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and punched, then applied with a pink of oil paint.
The texture of copies dated 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without layer on the laminated panels, with the help of a paint roll - it is not an oil paint but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museum: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different collection, the Moderna Caissesma in its exhibition will classify the six."
The Authentication Board already announced in July that it would investigate the “heavy accusations” that will be raised in the case of soap powder case.
But since then we have been there with an inexorable silence.
The rebels of Manille resign
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers resigned, the same ones who had retreated in a hotel in Manille, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who denounced the President corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he would not be able to account for any blood flow.
Soldiers who were faithful to the power had taken the hotel shortly before attacking the hotel with the help of tear gas.
The two dozens of soldiers had been rerunning in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday due to a 2003 missing putsch attempt – among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly climb with about 30 sympathetics.
Military police officers, who normally had to watch them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined him in his craftsmanship.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The power-loyal troops blocked the sector around the respectable hotel.
The Chairman called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was commanding before the Scouts Rangers Elite Unit, said that other army units would soon join the walk.
The critics of the regime had called for a major protest against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption reproaches for months.
Manille’s Finance District has already been the theatre of the attempt of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The uprising broke nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been putched against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of the Versatel telecommunications company’s participation.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company reported Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of social capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a ransom.
The option will remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step, we are trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German market for DSLs, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation to the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third, it is told on the market.
In the evening, United Internet had already acquired nearly 10% participation in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed 17,4 million new shares in the Stock Exchange worth €106,4 million.
United Internet purchased 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation on marketing of DSL products and mobile phones.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” explained a spokesperson from United Internet.
The two companies founded the company in participating MSPs to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, both companies want to be estimated to be satisfied with their participation of ten percent at Freenet, and not make use of their right to enlarge an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies would leave all the options open, particularly to increase participation in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The hardly predictable poker on Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecom market for months.
Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and complete subscriptions at the end of the third quarter.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch hold up to date a direct Freenet share of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment firm had already been decided in August.
