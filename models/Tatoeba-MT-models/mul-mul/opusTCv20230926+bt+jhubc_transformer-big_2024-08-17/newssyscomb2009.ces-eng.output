The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, together have 29 percent
The targeted weakening of the two sides of the so far major coalition and significant reinforcement of the right-wing populist parties have resulted in the first preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously deprived.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Courrent heightman Jörg Haider is planning to return triumphantly to national policy.
According to preliminary results, the country’s strongest party to social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of votes, but 5.5 per cent of votes are lost against the last 2006 elections.
The ÖVP was still worse, losing 25.6 percent by nearly nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in the Austrian poll history and especially in people who have elected early elections, literally catastrophic outcome.
Even in early July, when ÖVP left the coalition, people had a significant surplus in preferences before SPÖ.
However, the voters clearly punished them for leaving the government to defeat.
In the first responses to the results, speculations on the possible resignation of the party’s president and current Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the special meeting of the party's presidency.
Such development would obviously facilitate the journey to the increasingly most likely east end of the election result, i.e. to the restoration of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Due to the reinforcement of both the right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) received 18% pre-order and 11% of the BZÖ votes - but social Democrats at the same time expressed concerns about the reiteration of 1999, when people agreed to the populists (the FPÖ election was then unified) and a single party from the BZÖ in 2005
This development is apparently put forward by Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and is expected to return to Vienna to national policy.
Another Party of the Greens came to Parliament, which slightly lost and collapsed between Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
None of the other sides seemed to have crossed the four-percent limit and have not entered the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were accused of illegal browsing in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said there would be some cooling of Czech-India relations.
The minister said this in New York after his meeting with his Indian opponent Pranáb Mukherdjim.
"If it did not solve it, then yes, then there would be some cooling," he noted after a meeting that took place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherdže said after the negotiation that the executive may be very difficult to interfere in judicial matters.
However, he noted that in the case of Petra Sváchy, which was released from charges and was sentenced to punishment, the central government could act with the local government in Darjilingu, the jurisdiction of which the matter is subject.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best to appeal to a higher instance, according to Mukherdj.
He can then ask for a release at the court and wait for a sentence for freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself during the negotiations.
"It recommends appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to love him," said the Czech Diplomacy Chief.
The only way in which the Czech side can enter the whole matter is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that the Indian party has already provided such aid.
“We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India that have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he emphasized before his partner that the Czech Republic gave the problem of Czech entomologists great importance.
"We really consider a deep mistake in the imprisonment and regret of these Czech scientists," he said.
Answers to the question of whether the Indian party had promised to deal with the matter, the Minister avoided.
"I've got quite a lot of promises," he just said.
The Czech Republic judges the fight for the sea bottom
It will access the wall electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are displayed.
The continent does not care, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and along with the nearby sea bottom.
“The area is large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to a thirty-year-old staff team of the United Nations Ocean and Sea Law Division.
His head, head of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and sometimes adds it.
The government's working elan and enthusiasm.
The sea bottom hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, crude and other raw materials, but also unknown living organisms that have the key to developing cancer drugs.
The bottom is larger than the fixture
Today, coastal states have started vehemently to reach the new submarine territory.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often takes up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It has the exclusive right to all sources of continental shelf, according to the Convention.
“It is simply taken, the continental shelf has this part of the sea floor and its floors, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It is at the border of the coastal sea, often even at the border of two hundred marine miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
An application submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf must be submitted by extensive scientific documentation based on numerous cost-effective surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparation work.
“One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and professional technical assistance.
The Commission has discussed five requests, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
The World War has recently recorded the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its submarine states.
However, New Zealand also acquired the maritime floor, which the Commission admitted last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times larger than the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will come from the use of the sea floor in the future will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other States shall submit their requests gradually.
They can do this for up to ten years from the moment they ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shepherd ends, the area of the ocean’s bottom begins with the convention declared “the common heritage of humanity”.
There is no single state here anymore.
The right of mining in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea bottom but there is no Klondajk," said Mikulka, in a statement that "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enacted."
Czech in the Pacific
Today, a part of the sea day belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are dealing with other countries of the former East Block within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired the status of the so-called "transitional investor" in 1991 under the Convention, as well as investors of several other states.
It is authorised to benefit in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
Investor’s research area is somewhat bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is split there, this is some submarine reply Tater.
"There can be benefited from a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich spot for polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese," said another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Division Rober Sandev is presenting one such concrete.
It resembles a little potato or, in a little imagination, a beautiful shame that, according to the legend, revived Golem.
The German Special Forces were released in the release of the arms
The Egyptian government has asked for assistance from Germany to resolve the crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation was lost, special units were prepared, but it did not occur.
Further details of the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists in Egypt are gradually received to the public.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and Interior, the German Special Forces also indirectly participated in the rescue action.
According to the ministry, both specialists of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorism group of the German Police GSG9, the Flights of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, and also specialists in logistics from the Technisches Hilfswerk.
According to a further statement, the two ministry spokespersons from Monday afternoon, however, the German forces did not need because the kidnappers left their prisoners to go and escape when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
According to the Egyptian government, Germany has adopted assistance as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," said one of the spokespersons of the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers captured a group of travellers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians, and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After the deportation in the desert region in the south of Egypt, they transferred sales in border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the redemption.
The rescues are now well in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the farms was in custody of the German Embassy.
The details of the release were not expressed.
There is no information yet available in Berlin when rescue returns to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", all five tourists should also fly one of the German Airbuss and arrive in Germany on Tuesday with special forces.
U.S. House Rejects Rescue Package
The U.S. Congress’s first chamber left a $700 billion rescue package in close majority.
The Dow Jones Index has collapsed strongly.
In 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and the politicians of both sides, the majority did not find a program that should relieve the chaos on the financial markets.
A dramatic event, however, desperately attempted to convince criticism of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on a parliamentary vote, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition to avoid something that has not yet happened,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index declined by more than six percent, i.e. 600 points.
The reason investors were worried that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index value increased so that after the announcement of the breakdown of the package, it would fall again.
Experts now count with other serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme to enter into force, the consent of the House of Representatives and of the Senate is required.
Travel agents record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems that winter will be good for German tourist entrepreneurs:
According to one study, in tour bookings for the next month, the turnover was significantly increased - even more than 30 percent in the winter season compared to the previous year.
Despite weak economic growth, the taste of the Germans remains uncommon to travel.
When bookings for the winter season, travel agencies noticed a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year as the German Travel Union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey of the GfK Market Survey Institute, increased numbers of reservations are already available for autumn months.
According to the DRV, the sale was approximately 11 per cent higher in October compared to the year 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which each month evaluates the booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included bookings of tours held by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States is mostly requested, DRV said.
On these routes, reservation increases about one-third.
In addition, there are particularly demanding targets for the Germans in Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as domestic waters.
Mostly, the organized tours are in the course, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
With regard to increasing energy and food expenditure, there is a cost for a customer "tolerable than for individually organized holidays".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by using a discount on time booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year – even though, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a journey declined compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Doneconic repetitive pipe, beer from turkeys and prominent in screws from well-known designers.
For the first time on the beer.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV moderator and wears a sophisticated circle.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on the beer pit, and photographers are already thrown on us, and they're filled with memory cards - that's my bitterness, because I'm at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can be friends.
My cheap circle seems to have met its goal.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the equator, and so my feeling of comfort in the circle was rather limited.
But just after the arrival of Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everybody has a female shoe or leather pants on himself; no one looks disturbed or ridiculously affected - everything is completely normal.
The special views of a banana stand in the chocolate can only shine my tea.
One Mnichovyan warns me that I wrongly linked her: "You're free, in the middle of the virgin, right-handed, behind-handed."
They crossed their backs left.
"Good," he says and laughs.
Others with subtle flirting techniques do not handle so much, and they have simple sticked hats with the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch on the surrounding naked backs.
A young man with such exhibitionistic tendencies is named Bob, from England and also came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
It looks like "gorgeous" with prolonged "ooh".
That's what he's gonna tell me after he's just been drunk.
Just next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks they're waste baskets.
Bob is therefore one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as it is said in Bavaria to freely urinating people in the public.
Others are lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
They run around the eighth evening through the area where the Oktoberfest is held, especially healthcare professionals who have to take care of the worse drinks.
The doctors always appear in the caves - in four they wear a cover from the tent to the tent.
They work like most visitors to beer bowls: empty there, full again.
Who lies under the shelf of this promily rack is unseen.
"That's the ones that can't go on," one of the doctors calls me in response to my question and disappears in the dark.
Police Released the victim’s name
The name of a thirty-six-year-old woman who died in the hospital after her car hit in Essex was published.
The incident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 16-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of a disregardless ride.
He was already released on the police charge.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, European powers wanted to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the eastern coast of Bospora, perhaps just twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmuth Con in the neo-recessive slope.
That’s what the tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits around at the end of the stairs with the tower on every corner of the diamonds, in view of the uncertainty from some provincial German municipality.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slowly falls down.
But as soon as a person gets into a treasury, he can no longer doubt the size of the company, whose westest gate was the station.
In August 1908, the German consortium of the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation opened.
Germany, which took part in the game of the empire late, intended to implement its ambition to control the Middle East using this railroad that would lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further into the territory of Saudi Arabia today.
But the German imperial ambitions grew up during the First World War.
Their rails were attacked by a Lawrence from Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, arising from the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial units proceeded from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news for Hydarpaša station as well.
In 1917, the explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its processed roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, they have been gradually drunk, and history has been surrounded by it.
Today, however, this port to Anatolia and further to the east - at least symbolically - serves to emphasize the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - ACP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, arising from the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
New policy is now implemented - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with Palestinian Hamas and Fatah groups, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I had to meet one of the leading ACP foreign policy experts, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after the railroad ride, which reminded the ancient world rhythm of the famous Night Post document, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state that wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the ACP with its well-known Islamic roots represents the move to the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
She raised suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the AKP’s main tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on the evolving predecessors, surrounded by semi-destroyed business houses and traders to power where middle-aged managers in business clothing - men and women - meet to wreckage trades.
Suat Kiniklioglu could calmly be a central right-wing politician from almost any other European political party.
Sako, curvature, I'm sure he had Blackberry too.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey in its nearest area.
The war was an anomalie,” he said.
Turkey was cut off from its boundaries.
Today we must look at the east and the west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
They had to do both.
"But surely the time will come," I asked, "when maybe Turkey will have to decide?"
"Turkish," he said, "you wouldn't want such a decision to be made."
Then he emphasized that almost everyone I spoke to here said to remember that Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the surroundings of the Black Sea are equally beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, Europe as a whole seems to be able, metaphorically said, to travel through these rails to the East Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpasha station, after another major problem night, I thought of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who watched how this building was built 100 years ago.
How would they be surprised if they found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be in the main part of the Turkish hands?
And when I was waiting for a ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe."
So it seems that at least at that time there was no doubt which continent would have the right to this fascinating country.
Memory Life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11th) was in charge of Guildford's Philharmonic Orchestra and the congregation.
As part of the district music plan, he founded a year for this excellent congregation of young Proteus.
He should be up to 21 years old, but at the time Proteus singed in 1979 for the last time, a few of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological change of shape) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to let go of any music that was presented to him - whether madrigaly or Messiaen, whether separately or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptation created by such a young congregation was often stunning, always exciting, and all this thanks to the inspiration of one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged throughout the time.
How often only Tod told us that we "leave music to talk for ourselves."
He said, “The founder knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing this!"
His tactical technique was completely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorship nor May.
No matter what the music standard is, he has always taken it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any director was supposed to be passing on the rider, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when Guildford Philharmonic was directed from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed — and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the directors who, according to his words, simply "danced one or two intermediate helmets around the world."
Many of us will miss.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrolog William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author's notes in Beyond Nab End, but it's not exactly.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the time he performed a dissert work on the British rubber industry led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently issued it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitively left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is unknown why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was asked by the simplicity and strong instruction with which he acts on the viewers, and by the reliability and respect for photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of other things.
Resino can capture magical moments.”
Honda attacks for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will launch a second-generation Jazz sale.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle has already had a significant space, it now offers even more spacious interiors.
To this end, improved engines are connected, which increase the comfort of driving and allow more fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although from aesthetic point of view, the new Jazz line is very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred in this single-space car.
It is important to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it is necessary to note that the new Jazz comes into the market six years after the first generation is introduced.
Therefore, the first thing to note is the fact that Honda needed to rejuvenate this model for a shorter period than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less known model in Europe, it has become the sale of phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Just in Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold on the market since Hondy Jazz launched.
The second market has become an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda’s goal is to increase sales in its category.
So in 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 pieces of Hondy Jazz, with an estimated 100,000 cars in 2009, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sale of Hondy in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazzu, the Spanish branch’s leadership is expected to sell 2,000 pieces for the whole year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazzu will allow Honduras to significantly relieve the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, driving cars is expected to end the year with a total of 22,000 pieces sold, which is less than 4,000 in 2007 and a 16% decline.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market by 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2%.
In order to achieve this percentage, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a compact five-door hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises a global sale of about 200,000 pieces per year.
As regards markets, according to Japanese manufacturers, 50% of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage is divided by the old continent and Japan.
The launch of Hondy Insight sales is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it will be presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all the dimensions of the new Jazzu were expanded.
Its length increased to up to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the rotation width to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
Increased dimensions also increased the interior.
This advantage was achieved equally by the use of a new platform, equally by the storage of a fuel tank in the middle of the car that was already used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage space - which has a double-dog system - increased to up to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version of the 1.4 engine, as the volume of the luggage space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement besides external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment with glass panoramic roof - is easier access to rear seats.
The second-serie seat doors allow an angle of opening 80 degrees compared to 67 in the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of Hondy Jazz, there are new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower emissions of carbon dioxide and brings an excellent improvement of the drive system at the same time with a high-circuit moment in the full range of engine rotations.
The first 1.2-liter engine has 90 horse power at 6,000 rotations with a maximum rotation moment 114 Nm at 4,900 rotations.
This engine - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horse performance has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"Car Bees" prevents rains
Nissan has been inspired by nature this time, particularly by bees, to advance the development of crash protection technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes as a bees flying pattern, thus preventing rainfall.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which is the first step in rain prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Technical Progress Centre Nissan Motor Co. developed robots in collaboration with the Centre for Progress at the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology, Research and Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four safety sheets.
The robot is committed to strengthening the ability to prevent rainfall in the cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of a oval shape that is very similar to Nissan’s safety sheet.
The most important, however, are complex bees that are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing bees to fly in their personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers proposed what they called Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles that are located up to two meters in a circle of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the column microprocessor, which immediately transfers it to warning before the collision.
"When a obstacle is detected, the robot will resemble bee movements and immediately change the direction by turning the wheels into the right or even bigger angle to prevent rainfall.
The greatest difference compared to any existing system is the fact that all disgusting manuscripts are totally instinctive.
If so, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobile Laboratory and Chief Engineer of the project.
Unlike the bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to the direction that enables its wheels to rotate, but not in an infinite amount of directions and options like the bees.
In addition to acceleration and slowing, Nissan has also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from rain.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and to be maintained according to these data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous manoeuvres, which allows it to work without interruption with only two dozens of kB memory.
It might surprise you, but we don’t talk about giga or mega at memory.”
This is the first step in developing new technologies for immediate precipitation of rainfall, technology for which Nissan predicts the use of series cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead drivers to the target, avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy fear before you take a mortgage
It should be recognized that the U.S. Ministry of Finance, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, lacks or inventiveness.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgage at banks with doubtful solvency, they created a popular-scientific online game "Bad Credit Hotel".
They weren't a "Hotel of Bad Loans" or a "Good Loans" hotel.
The hotel and especially his reception look cloudy to think about whether it is the right time to ask for a loan once, twice or three times.
Especially where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even though it is not very detailed.
This site is suitable for youth rather than space for the whole public.
What happens when the game is over?
A dream room is available within the hotel.
At least something, because you prefer not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens MUFG’s capital
Banking house Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank to issue nine billion dollars to gain 21 percent of its capital. Acceptance of this report was a significant decline in its exchange rate.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9 percent of ordinary Morgan Stanley shares at a unit price of $25.25, which represents a total revenue of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of securities by 31 August.
MUFG invests another six billion dollars in convertible securities, which will provide 10% of its revenue and the exchange price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the entire operation would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley’s shares lost 6.79 percent and reached $23.07 around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic compound represents an important opportunity on the way to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the bank holding status," said John Mack, Director-General of the U.S. Group.
The new status was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, allowing him to differ from his activities, while it is under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest Wall Street east to take a much more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been changed over the last few days: Morgan just announced last Monday that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought even a week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, said in Tokyo, "we will be involved exclusively in ordinary shares.
However, in view of the current situation in the economy and market, we wanted to minimize the risks and also cover them.”
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for securities Morgan Stanley by 7 % less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction of the share profit by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities to regular shares in a year if the latter designated will be exchanged for a period of time for a price of 50 % exceeding the exchange price, i.e., for about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG brings will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase his cash.
However, the spokesperson refused to provide clarifying information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should praise Tier One’s eligible payment ratio of about 15%, i.e. one of the best in the industry.
Morgan explained that since late August he has "reduced" his balance.
The last few weeks were demanding for the group, as its exchange rate decreased by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt increased steadily.
These costs took up the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only survivor of Wall Street's big investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that she chose $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warrena Buffetta.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-create the Republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Huga Cháveze, Bolivian Eva Moralese and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominated submitted a new constitution proposal for voting, according to the pattern of his opponents and friends.
And his mission is fulfilled, because at least 64% of voters, according to the official results covering 80% of the votes, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" won 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the vote tickets were empty.
To be adopted by the Constitution, he had to gain half of the votes plus one.
Two surveys conducted on the east side of the election rooms and non-governmental organizations predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, situating between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, however, demanded the victory of his constitutional proposal on Sunday night.
"The Constitution won the whole line," he assured and congratulated Ecuadorians at Guayaquil Governor's headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quita.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean opponent, Michelle Bachelet.
The voting, which was held in peace by the United States State Organization (OEA), concerns the text of 444 points building "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The Constitution is dedicated to the power of the state over the economy by reserving it to "planning the development" of a country living mostly from oil mining by foreign companies and from the currency sent by its emigrants.
The proposal protected by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of the state, which will be able to perform two next four-year mandate and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that this power will be used and will be a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution establishes, among other things, the principle of free health and education that the President has launched in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives under poverty.
It is also considered a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuador base as the default point of U.S. anti-drug operations.
In Chad, 19 seats were released.
The Egyptian command was attacked by the kidnapper of eleven tourists and their eighth escorts, which were arrested ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held in prison for ten days in the desert, were moved to the capital of Egypt on Monday.
In the morning, the Egyptian command was released in Chad.
They flew around 15:30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, closely neighbouring the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without the possibility of expressing themselves in the press, on board the helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, Kahiry’s border residence district, to be undergoing medical checks there.
"They were totally excited" and "no redemption was paid to the Unoes," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zohejr Garran said on the airport's roadway.
Since his detention on September 19, during a safari in a car with all four wheels on the hillside of Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of arms have been woven from one to the other 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of Aegyptous, safari organizers.
A leader of the Egyptian security components said that 30 members of the special units who approached the location on board two helicopters dropped on the steak during the night just before the crash.
"The shooting occurred, half of the kidnappers were killed and the other refugees were killed," said the source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "Blesk" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
Chief of Italian Diplomacy Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is just located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of Italian special forces.
"We must admit that we have achieved this result thanks to professional and effectiveness of people from our secret services, from special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the redemption would be paid.
In the evening, the Sudan army stated that the guard had detained a vehicle with a drive of all four wheels, on which the kidnappers appeared, killed six of them, including the commander of Chad, and two arrested.
The Army argued that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Liberation Movement of Sudan - the Unit (SLA-U), which immediately refused that movement.
Letters - Quiet majority of culture resorts
The debate on culture financing fills the pages of newspapers with fingertips and is the topic of the current pre-election campaign.
It's better time.
However, one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to wash the poor amounts provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national monumental places that are hungry?
What politicians are surprised to remind the federal government that they remember their monuments and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on restoring the Chinon Castle in the Loiry Valley?
The Constitution states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations in cooperation.
In Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers joined in 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogies, the conservation of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few minors.
Often, these companies are the guard dogs of our monuments, whose harassments are hopelessly protesting when promoters and leaders release their buldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally reach the tribune for history and monuments?
Benelux's government is part of Fortis's bank
Benelux states will help the Belgian-Holland Bank Fortis, which has become the first in Europe to become a problem due to the spreading effect of the U.S. mortgage market: three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a billion capital participation in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch government agreed to participate in the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to become a major crisis during the crisis of the international financial markets, spreading in the waves for more than a year, and decisions made in this regard could be considered as a precedent from a certain point of view.
In the sense of a decision born on Sunday night, all three states will buy nearly half (49 percent) of the bank’s property.
The Bank sells part of its capital shares with absolute certainty, and then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year by the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The Fortis Bank’s shares began to slow down last week, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis were already seen in the Constitution.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too big to let it be devastated with its 85,000 employees.
The company’s prices fell only by 12 percent on Friday, at a minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the shares have fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current prices of shares, the group's total market capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but, according to the company's leaders, it is unreal.
The company’s leadership still blames Fortisu’s shares of uncertainty on the offshore market in connection with the adoption of a $700 billion package plan.
The shares have risen slightly on Monday.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the bank’s head.
The Monetary Institute also searched for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has signed up yet.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry about their money.
The bank's clients have not yet panic, and the branches have not been an attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has a number of leasing companies.
Leather in the cucumber
Life and health insurance companies in the United States often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of people’s data on the purchase of drugs.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that lies with the use of prescription data in any case for the permission of the person concerned.
He must be in the hand of someone who is independent, otherwise we trust a bullshit," says the Washington Post newspaper Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
The insurance company shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events depend on the health status of the beneficiaries, and if the risk is assessed as too high, the insurance will not be closed with it.
They were previously sent for medical examinations and the contract was concluded only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer from the pharmacies easily find out what drugs he bought in the last and a half year, from which the program itself produces what disease he suffers and what his health is.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reduction drugs, it refers to the fact that it has virtually uncontrollable high blood fat levels, which immediately classifies it into a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some at the same time determine the risk coefficient, so the insurance company, besides papering, almost no work is left, although they create small difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that medications can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are used against migraine or hot nuts, but are also effective against depression.
These are a significant risk increase factor from the point of view of commercial insurance, but the mainly nominated problems are not.
In order to request and process the data, a special company was created that, before providing the necessary information from the pharmacies, requested the patient’s permission.
The authorities are now forced to do so, although they haven’t regretted their uncertainty.
Some companies have also recently processed the results of laboratory examinations associated with data on drugs that can provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health condition.
More and more companies have access to data, while controlling their use will be increasingly complicated.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The proposal for a law that will grant authority to authorities to control companies specializing in data provision is before the Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: hence, his program has developed so that the presentation of the data is linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the permission in question can only be hardly denied, otherwise the insurance company will not conclude a contract with it.
So the blinds are just slightly dismissed into the leaf of good will.
Global Marseillan menu
The European Union and India doubled trade
Since the European Union and India are mutual leading business partners, this issue, alongside other, mainly global issues, also led to the agenda of the ninth meeting at the highest level.
The French-Indian summit will also be held today, which will focus primarily on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union acknowledges that India is developing democratic power, which should be given greater opportunity to talk about international affairs, but that Member States have not yet found a common appointment in support of the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been further discussed at the nineteenth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, respectively President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, and High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double trade in five years, or increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overwhelming ambitious goal.
In the legal sense, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been agreed, so it has become green in the future and also air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The goal is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi figures between EU partners up to nineth place.
The summit also focused on a global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively, and terrorism - both sides in all its forms have condemned and called for an accelerated call of the UN conference.
They also urged the end of the Dauhá business negotiations, although both of them have a large share of its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed it will last on its energy and climate program, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed that the next year's climate conference would need to conclude a global agreement and the production of greenhouse gases to reduce the greenhouse gas by 50 per cent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and support international conferences to address the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister is traveling to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is planning to close a trade on peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that the commissions to build Indian nuclear reactors worth €20 billion are gained by French companies.
According to the Agency reports, the agreement should be in force for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Library Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with over four hundred three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as a honourable guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural celebration of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – at 264 square meters of exhibition area.
It will follow a press meeting at Room Buchmesse Structure in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publication in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors' books is still reduced in relation to total Italian production, mainly in regard to literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The remainder of the plane was found by Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying desert in Nevada.
Trousers were discovered at one upper level at an overseas height of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area in the Sierra Nevada, at the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains within the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, raised doubts that remained: "The aircraft was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that it is exactly what Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
Sheriff explained that human residues were not found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced a few hours after the detection of the piece was sent by an investigation team that finally identified the plane: Bellancu 8kcab, unreported since September 3, 2007 when Fossett flew from Yerington, Nevada to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the border with Nevada, some of Fosset's personal objects were found one pair of their homes near Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, money in cash and one band.
Fosset's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to the long collection of the championships.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of a single flight.
Three years later, the world was dressed in an airplane and without landing.
Its many records also include flights at a height of 15,445 meters, above Andami, although with a cowboy.
Glk, an advertisement you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the faith of news into this sector.
Thanks to its untraditional processing, unexpected and unconventional communications will be accompanied by the launch of Suv Glk on the market and will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
In this way, an advertisement campaign that will accompany the debut of a new vehicle will also launch an informal way of communication thanks to a futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The Maxi Posters project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins by introducing a car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in nearly real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Actually, when you look at the picture, you’ll have the impression that the car’s going out of the plaque.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different moments in all its smaller ones, so that it will be re-assembled in a single image.
Mercedes is definitely trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical area of automotive communication.
Will he be able to raise the interests of future customers in this way?
We know who the Italian Chuligans are.
From Triveneta, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls who are now embarrassed by Italy? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years, and which, in fact, has never had overwhelming problems.
She never met the fans of the opponent.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founders come from Triveneta.
From Verony, Padovy, Terst and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) were added to them from Campania and Puglie.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: they were removed on Saturday evening so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found true Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave 144 tickets for the match to Italian fans: all for the name, which is easy to control.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Daslem, no one forbidden to visit the stadiums.
The four blue fans who had previously had been infringed from the stadium were denied the ticket and the match was forbidden.
Now Viminale is waiting to read reports from the Bulgarian police and then take action: In this case, Daspo can be given for at least five years to fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the oppression.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, in short, won't go to one stadium anymore.
Fortunately.
But now there is fear of emulation: this means that more than 50 others are added to them.
"We must immediately remove this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," the Viminal said.
So, "excellently open eyes, especially because of the national competition in Leci on Wednesday."
Just in Puglia there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio, which can count on one part of Aise, will be held on Tuesday, a secret service that takes care of the stadiums.
"Community Leaders and loaded footsteps during Mameli's hymn? It's not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), which is the director of the Viminial Observatory for a few weeks (acquired a place that was previously Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a florist in Terst, where the core of supporters of Ultras Italia was founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course that the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
“I’m not a sociologist,” says the Observatory Unit, “the crimes are judged by the country in which they have become.
So far, this group has remained within the boundaries, now let’s look at what has happened and we’ll evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the celebration of Mameli’s hymn: it’s not a crime, but if you allow it, it’s incredulity.”
