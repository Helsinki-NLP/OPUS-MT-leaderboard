The Republican Party's strategy against Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy of the need to combat election fraud.
However, Brennan’s centre of such fraud calls a myth that election fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die after a flashing intervention.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the U.S. over the past 10 years.
One is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partially undermined by the U.S. democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. is responsible for the organization of federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have denounced new laws that harm the electoral process or enrollment into the election list since 2009.
This phenomenon recorded disruptions after the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries arrived.
As a result, 180 amendments to a law restricting voting law were submitted only in 2011 in 41 countries.
New electoral laws require voters to submit their identity certificate with photographs and American citizenship certificate.
In addition, these laws restrict the period of pre-election, disarm the right to enter the list of voters on the day of the election and revoke the right to vote for citizens with a registration in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required an identity certificate with photographs in voting.
The first state to impose this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law was confirmed in 2008 by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Republican authorities have accelerated the expansion of this procedure to other countries as well.
Over the past two years, these bills have been supported in 34 countries in order to force voters to submit their identity certificates with photographs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards such as health insurance cards.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged allowing to vote, have no identity certificate with photographs issued by the government authority of their state.
There is no such identity certificate for about five million new voters in 2012.
Additionally, the purchase of the required identity certificate is often more than $100.
The new limits are disproportionately affected mainly by young people, minorities and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo identity certificate.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their support for democratic candidates are not entitled to use their identity certificate with photography issued by their school in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer Republican candidates to use cards exposed to these clubs in the elections.
By 2004, no state required a nationality certificate for elections.
The first such demand was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have adopted laws that lay down the obligation of voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is important to note that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic side.
Republican legislators in 2011 supported laws in eight states that disrupt voters' registration on the day of elections.
In addition, they restrict the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, a voter registration campaign helped to register about 10 million people.
The measures taken after 2009, however, resulted in a decline in the recording of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states to shorten the period for the elections in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of African-American voters represented the predecessor, although only 13% of African-American voters were in this country.
The Hispanics did the same.
Only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the people voted in advance.
On the other hand, white people, who represented 76% of all voters, represented only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Obviously, against the adoption of laws restricting voters' registration, democratic legislators and their supporters were very emphasized.
Democratic governors blocked several bills.
In order to stop the most controversial laws, the U.S. Prosecutor-General was even injured.
They were able to reduce the damage.
For example, the laws that require the submission of the identity certificate with photographs have only received 16 of 34 countries.
However, the new rules are completely unfairly difficult to exercise voting rights in 2012.
Democratic critics are primarily talking about the prejudice of approved laws and consider them to be obvious to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states where these laws were approved represent 171 out of 270 votes in the Assembly of voters necessary to win in presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one is already certain today: these new regulations will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partially undermined by the U.S. democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to conduct an examination or not?
The PSA test has always brought wrong results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, which has led to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this has also increased the weight loss of men who have already tried to go to the examination at all.
Let yourself investigate or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In U.S. studies, a high level of contamination among the individual tested groups was shown, so it is difficult to interpret these results and give valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference in mortality between patients undergoing the examination and those who did not follow it.
This study also showed after a 12-year delay that those who do not go to the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend an examination from 50 years of age or 40 years of age if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.
The more threatened are also African-American men.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are intact.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treating prostate cancer, which has no long-term life impact, and to focus on active surveillance of the disease in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not treat because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them to life.
We will rather suggest them to carry out active supervision and, in the event of the progression of the disease, we will offer them treatment.
We are increasingly and more accurately establishing criteria that help to decide which type of treatment and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend that the examination be carried out.
However, it is important to conduct a consultation with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undertake an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Company, Movember has created the Movember Movember Movement tool to evaluate for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, it seems the best means to reduce the risks of disease adoption of healthy lifestyle principles.
If everyone eats healthy and moves enough, it is estimated that up to 30% of cancer cases can be prevented.
"If everyone stops smoking, this data would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman of Canadian cancer research company.
On the contrary, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer disease is caused by inheritance.
Some percentages are also completely unexplained.
Canada’s cancer research society remains a priority for the fight against smoking, although the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes cost 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This has great harm to human health.
"There is still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
Incitative estimates: 10 years after smoking stops smoking, the risk of cancer death decreases by half.
Weight
Bodybuilding and obesity, according to SCC, are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, thick intestines and ends, intestines, mucus, and uterus.
“The research shows that regular physical activity protects from fat intestinal cancer throughout life,” the report adds.
Nutrition
This organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid the use of the same.
Conservation of meat by taking, drying or salting can lead to cancerous substances.
"They can cause damage to the body cells and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet made clear conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory according to SCC.
Although one of them believes that there is a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks rather of its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to discuss how important it is to talk about his concerns and precedents from his family with his doctor.
"Control in the investigation does not mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs's boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs's boson triggered a legitimate break in the summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matters in the universe.
And furthermore, it is the last particle, whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or at least "bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
Among the physicians, however, there is no 100% certainty that it is Higgs’ boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle available, which is very similar to Higgs’ boson as predicted by the standard model.
New data published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto are confirmed rather, but there are still missing all data to ensure absolute certainty.
However, let's suppose it's Higgs's boson because the risk of error appears to be small, and let's look at what's going on in fact.
In this world, a completely undeniable law applies, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be obeyed - and do not try too hard to do so, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particulate physics is a very strange world, it shows that it also applies to a similar law: the principle of Paul’s exclusion, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum state” - this “state” approximately creates some of their properties.
The physical particles are also divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we find organized citizens, or fermions, who obey Paul’s principle.
And on the other end, the boss are moving, under anarchists who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can be calmly at the same time.
These bosoms are further divided into two groups according to the device (in the meantime totally amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley’s laboratories: meats that we leave here without notice, and “power particles” that spread large natural forces and with which Higgs’ boson is probably in some way.
However, it is necessary to say that these bosoms are not as exotic animals as possible.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or a "part of light", which is a "porter" of electromagnetic power.
When particles with an electric charger accelerate or change their direction, they "broken" the electromagnetic field in this particular location, similar to the cloud thrown into the fisherman.
This "disruption" will result in an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation etc.) and this wave is nothing but photon - and therefore one of the "power carriers".
Stable fields
It's the same with Higgs's boson, just with the difference that "disrupting" is another field, Higgs's field to get this boson out.
This Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitement, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen levels of fish, already black just a lot of large ballvan.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as a CERN laboratory accelerator - a large hadron accelerator with injectable connections is a circle with a circle of 27 km! - so that such energy can be developed.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again suitable for clarifying the relationship between Higgs and the nose.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - for example, a piece of paper will never hold onto the fridge itself.
And it is also true that with the Higgs field they do not react to all the particles: those that do so have a certain quantity, while others (such as photons, let’s look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Novack asks why all these researches are what they'll bring to me?
From the science point of view, the validity of the standard model (SM) is confirmed, allowing physicians to undermine any inconsistency between SM observation and predictions.
In addition, little physicians literally want to find them, because a smaller difference could open the space of "new physics" and cure some misunderstandings in the model.
It should be noted that the model has enormous deficiencies, does not bring any clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matters, which constitute about 80% of the space matter (uha!).
However, CERN has not yet revealed such contradictions.
Odezvy
The responses to these researches in the daily life of Mrs. and Mrs. Nováckie can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe that there would be no one.
Look: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell’s laboratories had no idea of the revolution, and their work was already triggered.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physician Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser rays (previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially considered such a "labor toy".
Just imagine it...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan it at first at all, now serves as "about" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around LHC must necessarily change our lives, but that means that a person really never knows...
Paliative care - The best way to get out of life... | Le Devoir
Through its Commission for Decent Death, Quebek has recently been involved in the challenging questions about the end of life.
The debate should continue soon, while the bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still stayed alone in his apartment in Montérégia.
The prostate cancer that fed her gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," he says without emotions on his bed at a palliative care house Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived last day.
"It's still a shock, you can't get ready for it," he adds.
The disease carried out its work: an incomplete weakness prevents him from taking himself to the toilet or just eating himself.
She is rejected looking at a delicious breakfast and agrees that we can help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop him, bringing medication to him, offering a bath.
The courage to normal death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of this diarrhoea, it humiliates me," he says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found the medication for his problem.
"Man has been taught that men are wearing vestues all the time," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on the abilities of a person,” the psychologist says.
According to the opinion of a number of people dealing with palliative care, essential moments take place in the core of such a return.
Patients who go home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
Their prediction is up to three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "treatment" care.
In the case of Ms. A., 89, the worst worries is to die "in full consciousness."
The disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I have no desire in my life anymore," she says, and then she allows us to install her breathing device.
He is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the next few days.
At Victor-Gadbois home, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, the body care is provided with nutritional help.
This looks like a palliative care that occurs unless anything else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québec, a single bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants appears.
It's very little if we realize that we're all going to die once.
Here life continues in optimum conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it’s a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, a brandy or pepsi can be given to him, according to the taste.
Diabetes no longer need to protect their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
They brought a beer to Mr. X, who died later in the night.
This morning his son drinks a beer in honor of his deceased father.
"We help patients as well as their relatives," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care Service.
Victor-Gadbois’s home is going after each other days, but they don’t like each other.
In addition to a thirty-nine-year-old man, who is happy with his last meeting with his family deeply undertaken on the pockets, while bearing to him for his honor, a sixty-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, wife and two little children, dies tragically to try all the possibilities.
“There are always three to five beds for people with cancer under 45 years of age,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, and 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, i.e. care, designed to relieve suffering as soon as the sick reaches the final stage of his life, whether at home, hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois home and the palliative treatment company in the Grand Montréal area, specialize more less exclusively in the care of oncological patients.
This essential lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are worried about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed in the course of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia.
She recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days preparing for tremendous pain without taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is fearful that patients will not be asked for murder because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists take care of their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the negative forecast.
The hope of survival of Hélène Richard was already totally minimal when she left a challenging chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was finishing the treatment, she replied that she regrets the fact that I stopped fighting, she tells us.
And at the same time she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the sick who want to die grate their doctors for not fulfiling their desires when their palliative pigs relieve their pain.
However, it is necessary to note that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the Director of Paliative Care at the Home Paliative Care Society in the Grand Montréal Area, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of the lifetime, doctors often use a palliative sedative, which will sleep until the moment of sleep, whether it is injured or permanently administered.
We cannot see this part of suffering.
A patient who will not get rid of pain will have an increasing opportunity to access palliative sedatives.
Those who are sick who do not have sedatives always say the same: "I want to die."
But that doesn't always mean "I want you to give me euthanasia" rather than "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this reporting enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Road management officials, construction entrepreneurs and public practices, lobbyists of political parties and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which the construction industry, state officials, politicians, trade unions and mafias are mixed.
This "burrow" came very expensive Quebec taxpayers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has scattered since we took essential measures," says ironical Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec deputy and former police chief in Montreal.
Thanks to it, in 2011, the scandal broke out on the basis of a coherent investigation on the cross-examination of the road construction contracts in Quebec, which was approved by the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest after long delays.
"Duchesneau's report" confirmed a direct link between the industry, the untransparent financing of the parties and corruption of state officials.
"It has been since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "the Ministry of Transport has only savings on orders of billions of dollars," when some people have kept their instincts on the edge of getting a share on them!
Charbonneau's commission "and brought two mayors to demission," adds with the hope that she will be able to "discover the illness of some people".
Constant Corruption Fighting Unit founded in 2011
The Constant Corruption Combat Unit, established in 2011, is also involved in the fight with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
To this end, the policemen "Marteau's family" who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "money pipeline" significantly relieves the swelling of contracts.
Over the past few weeks, they have conducted a number of surveys and complained about fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of one of the municipalities.
The other one on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
He is suspected that he repeatedly received charges in exchange for public procurement.
Official charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called for sensation by explaining to the Commission the "system" mechanism of procurement of public procurement.
During these years, he spent 3% of the contracts he earned in Montreal, an intermediary associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to Union Montréal, under the nomination of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Within 2000, he was generous to all parties and devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were at the time in power.
He also admitted that he had organized illegal funding for former Liberal Vice-Premier Nathalie Normandeau.
Orders with cash pipes whose prices are fixed
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked very much.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in a very detailed detail in front of the commission: in the course of ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invited tournaments, tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pockets at a total of $736,000 in exchange for orders with money, at the price he had given.
Other public transport agents admitted that they had left paying rewards for overvaluing invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-processing.
Mayor Martin Dumont later accused Tremblaye of sharing his eyes on the simultaneous budget that brought dirty money into his cash.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, casting Montreal into a vast crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, he has committed himself against the sale of the municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of the growing real estate store.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "she's behind the nails in an attempt to understand the functioning of the promoted morgue system in order to stop the gangree and to overcome the guilty."
The process is "painful, but positive."
We are in the cleaning phase of the wound, but we need to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure supervision so that these doubtful practices cannot be returned.
As if he was cleaning himself.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that “public agents have printed hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is particularly concerned about the roles of “deputy members informed about this lace” if they have not entered these chess!
It estimates that 70% of the funding of Québec election campaigns comes from dirty money, and with irony adds: "I've heard that it's just a weak failure of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to restrict gifts to the parties to $100, but it does not solve the situation: "Until the election expenditure is strictly limited, the dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It suggests a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer drop; if we bravely focus on the essence of things, we can rebuild on more solid foundations and with greater control and compliance with laws."
If this story has depicted the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who laughs at him to look at his own palace.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and PSG have set a completely new pace.
How do you explain this evolution?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into one another, or a completely new PSG dimension.
The big players came to us.
I get alongside them every day.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And in the matches, it is easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From the beginning of my preparation at INF Clairefontaine to the transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always been thinking of a single degree.
You are using the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The forces of this summer are usual to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that the player like me has a greater taste of the game and wants to give the maximum performance.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played on the same post as me.
And Ancelotti has a decisive word in the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all technicians.
Today, she is not equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a huge experience and has earned a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he won another title in Paris.
I had a calm conversation with him in January.
I had a number of injuries behind me.
The confidence he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the first league, Lyon picked up our front position.
But we're still in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have made it very easily to the eighth final.
What is the goal of your club in this contest?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a hard competitor for quality European teams.
We want to first win our qualification team in front of Port so that we can play eight finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order to become a big European club, Paris must win the titles and register in history.
It's not yet today.
On the financial side, PSG has funds to achieve this purpose.
Would it be a big failure to not win in the first league as last season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We still missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we wanted to win.
We had a great season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had the season even more amazing.
I think this will happen this year.
Although great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to win the title, I think we have weapons available to win them.
Do you think the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us because of what we have invested here and what we have players.
We're totally accepting that.
The fact is that when we defeat Troyes 4:0 at home and there is still something we read in our newspapers, it's not really nice.
A man asks what people may want more from you.
You can’t win 4:0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved to be able to play.
Look at Manchester City, who has no longer tried the second season in the eighth finals, while also investing large amounts!
Given the amounts invested, you could expect to have a surplus in front of the other 15 points!
You insult the other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which weren’t too successful last season, moved to the next phase with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the first league is.
I hope we will be able to smile in May and say that despite all the difficulties we have been able to win.
It seems that the PSG in all depends on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is good that it is said that there is "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovich is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proved that he's the star of the 1st league.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
We respect people and players in our team.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is really exceptional.
This also led the others to increase their own game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow next to each other.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French representation?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I experienced it and I got out of it stronger.
I can also play good matches today.
I’ve been hoping for this since my arrival in the representation.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our performance an example.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps in the head of the national team?
They talk about the results.
In MS qualifications, we are in a good place.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to players and can inspire for victory.
Laurent Blanc was the same.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is the remission (1:1) from October 16, Spain a solid default match?
This match has given us self-confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I haven’t experienced such a match for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
In addition, as it is often true in these technologies, there is a clear political view: the belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (then transferable to dollars, euro...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin rate first reached a maximum of $30 (€23) in June 2011, five months later decreased to $2, today it moves to the border of about $10 (the overview of the rates is shown on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world’s exchange for real money or financial products, it’s nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finances released in October.
Bitcoin refers to “the most successful virtual money”, “competitive dollar and euro” and “the period of normal money”.
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual money by being used as "credits" for the process in the video game that a person gets a game or can buy (and leaks even exchange back).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the networks are depots of books of regular accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two email addresses via e-mail.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual key encryption system.
This means that the network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of ordinary accounts that are distributed across the network.
The key phase is the recording of this new transaction in this book.
It is conducted by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solvent, some temporary central banker, will be entitled to reach this additional row.
This is the phase of file cutting; i.e., the transformation of a huge file to a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will "transcend" this new transaction and add the number to it, only afterwards the whole "disambiguation".
The goal is to find the number that provides a specific print (null at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.
The transaction will then appear inevitably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user wants to pay the same money twice for the purpose of fraud very quickly (up to ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be left because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this award is divided regularly into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided into a hundred million, so the space for the margin is here.
The difficulty of the assigned task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rise and falls.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stored bitcoins have been decomposed.
"Useed stock does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also monitors the possibilities of washing dirty money thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizman Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of regular accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not offering.
In November, "big discounts" were launched.
"The exchange of $30 thousand was made," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to transform bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book about these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or contactless payment on mobile, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are more expensive.
The holder also manages its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured for traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address that can be "photographed and recognized by phone", explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and to move to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin gets out, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB assumes a review of the various risks that are considered to be increased today if this kind of money will be successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what about it?
The French units left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. units should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not to wait for everything from us.
The biggest damage was caused by the people in the countryside of Afghanistan that we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we also, because we have come to 88 soldiers killed, and all of these injuries and frozens.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often are rural people who reject the presence of foreign armies as in the Soviet era.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though Djihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbekistans, Tadžikistans were added to them.
Now they experience tolerance and often the help of local rebels, but if western forces drop, their support will decrease.
The departure of French units from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the tops of the mountains posed with mandls thanks to French loans, took place in order.
Trucks and panzered vehicles arrived in Kabul without attacks with air escort helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
From their non-stop procedure between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed significantly.
The cable was then empty, and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of the fights between various defence groups.
Their take of control over the land was then considered to be its kind of liberation, return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the dark of these rural people, which was fully controlled by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved until our time.
Former Mudhahdinins, the Afghan government and current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women under the control.
In 2001, the major officers of the war against the Soviet forces returned to power.
They became chefters, entitled state lands that sold as construction lands to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and took advantage of huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never in battle.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people are looking for a government that they won't make up thieves.
A number of young people want to go as they go who have been able to use American wisdom: the escape of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and associated with ideology.
During the extermination in Iran or Pakistan, the modern world was known and its benefits were gained.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; currently 5 million people live in Kabul, five percent of the total population.
In the towns, schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to provide work, they no longer want to return to the dark of previous parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, loves mobile phones; TV and Turkish series showing the modern world watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that will be placed in her head be considered legitimate?
The former fighters against the Soviet Army have already restored provincial militia, which will be outside the control of central power.
Afghanistan, a top country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralization according to the pattern of Western states, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, which led to the abolition of the position of Prime Minister that existed since the constitution was adopted in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially when the elections are scheduled for April 2014.
However, its country has been significantly dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has failed to restore, no retention works, no essential moisture system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
The priority is a private initiative.
In the country destroyed for three decades of wars, governmental control of infrastructure would be necessary.
It has been reported that Afghanistan has huge poor wealth.
And that just led to the feeling that western states were here only to be able to power it.
Without energy for processing iron or copper on site and without means of transportation of raw materials across the mountains, however no mining of growth can take place.
Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak copper and left international archaeological teams (for the support of the World Bank) an opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area to maintain the role of the most important employer throughout the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on much of imports and exports, will also be required to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French units was completed on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys lycea, French departments at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural fields, supporting archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "acquiring heart and soul" has been an easy task to harmonize assistance and military activities, in which the service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was revoked in 2012, but has achieved a number of agricultural interests in the area of the agriculture and the uncountable French non-governmental organization.
These work, involving many local workers, helped to shake up the rise: moisturizing, fountains, drinking water, foresting, fruit trees, soil protection and enlargement of processing areas.
What memory do we have after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often at an overseas height above 2,000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural assistance from local communities in the province of Kapis.
In order to free these farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, they wish, according to their words, to achieve uncertain civil aid in their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected by them.
Hard work in the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursí left himself to another poker party.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the announcement of a constitution, which temporarily grants him unlimited powers, he decided to play a vabank.
He announced on Wednesday, regardless of the view of all the others, that the Constitutional Assembly will approve the final text tomorrow.
A few weeks ago, the head of the state assigned this meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, weakening the constitutional stability of the country and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative only further strengthened the disintegration of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president continues in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "infringe his word" and "infringe the right".
However, his followers make sure that it is a means to escape the constitutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transitional process.
The referendum should be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that makes Brotherhood resign from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to explain the article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to re-acquire national and democratic legitimacy, while the entire country refuses protests.
As he confirmed in an interview for the U.S. Weekend Time, Muhammad Mursí appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this rapidly organized voting is made by the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You either approve my text, or I will hold unlimited powers," which otherwise should end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 Members of the mentioned Constitutional Assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
The majority of the liberals were missing in voting.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was announced, they bore doors with the fact that they had no opportunity to speak of their opinions.
The defenders of human rights, civil society or religious minorities have imitated their steps.
In order to achieve tolerance, 11 of the substitutes were quickly supplemented yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles of the Constitution were often unanimous.
The commentators further stopped by the fact that one of the few disputes took about that day... hours of prayer, when some committee members stopped the view that the hours in the meeting room were not correctly arranged.
The text, which was voted last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains in line with the 1971 Constitution version and states that "the foundations of the rights of Sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term "supply" with the term "rule", which would allow more strict application.
For Islamists again, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their good will and respect for the other parts of the Egyptian society.
"The coverage," the liberals, who see only a speech problem in that.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers the advisory role to the University of Al-Azhar, particularly in the matters of checking compliance with the laws of the Sharia law.
According to the Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, it's uncomfortable because "people called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of the theocracy.”
The concerns of the liberals are even more distorted by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the existing.
“There has not been any concrete religious implications so far.
With this Constitution, Egypt remains a framework citizen state.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not upright, but university workers, many of them graduated in French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a constitutional transition work in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be disputes with regard to the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to a religious dictionary.
There is a reference in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic Law Sciences, read.]
And in the future, a question can be raised to the extent that civilian judges are competent to express themselves.”
Yesterday’s approved text has been very criticized in addition to religious sites because of the enlarged powers given to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood persists in the fact that they have been significantly restricted compared to the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of military representatives, the Parliament will not carry out the audit of the budget for the defense, but the National Council of Defense.
Furthermore, there will be no prohibition in military courts to proceed with civilians as required by the association for the protection of human rights.
This association speaks about its doubts in connection with the text which they say is directed against freedom.
Criminal offences are preserved and offences are still prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article is dealing with the protection of women, Heb Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word has not been mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to attend a television show last night, protests are scheduled for this afternoon.
The heads of the state will then manifest themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for sacred places, world puppy and sea from a saturated solution of salt
The promised land combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and the ineffectiveness of nature.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To worship the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
For all who enter this "prisonment" will come to the mercy of God.
And Galilee - instead of the miracles of Jesus: transforming water into wine to the wedding, walking through the water, calming the storm, and filled the network.
Jesus also appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
The most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here will go through the path of pain, or the path of Jesus’ Cross (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment took place, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the temple of God's tomb on the Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stones of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian puppy of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree from which the cross was made to the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews - the wall of the necklaces, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people here leave records with desires that will then be fulfilled.
Start the way to the vertical
The cutting of the fortress of Masada remained from the secret hidden from the enemy Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The cutting is located on the hills of the mountains at a height of 450 m above the sea level.
Only those with their own powers can get to it who deal with horrosion.
Others on this historic mountain will take off the lake.
And in the north of the country, at a height of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge flow of tourists in winter months.
To this skiing paradise, tourists are transported by a hill bus from the hills.
The total length of mountain trails is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, the pagan gods believed to be at the top of the mountains.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t visit all over the course of one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It stores ancient Qumran manuscripts, or sweats from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and further approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exponents.
There is also a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition, their plates are widely represented by impresionist and expressionist Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which is represented by visitors by several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figures of the users of the baths and the baths of the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the soils of Dalí and Rodena.
There are no guides or awards of souvenirs here.
Entrance is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum – Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv – tells one of the most dramatic sites in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built on a memorial of 1.5 million children who were killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You'll get in and find yourself in the dark.
The stars are shaking.
And the names of the children of the Jews and the names of the land in which they were destroyed.
Ukraine is also introduced.
Improve your health
The three main bath centres of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
The hotel offers pools, aquaparks, delfinaria and oceanaria.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can also bathe in winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and people buy it all year round.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the most special sea in the world, located at the lowest fortress point of the planet - at a level of 417 meters below the sea level.
Azur water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps at the level even people who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealisticly beautiful.
Get out here to undergo treatment by using salt water - salts, and medicinal baths that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the pancreas, diabetes, to cure your swelling nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by an ancient part of Tel Avivu, a city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Among them, the famous sea routes linked to Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love towels with the streets that are named after the signs of the animal.
It is said that if you press on the walls in the street of your "your" sign, happiness will be rewarded for you.
In Jaffa you may meet new spouses coming here from all over Israel and even from other countries to let them take pictures.
And in Caesarea, in the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre and "acquire" the fortress of the crosses.
In the Roman times, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the headquarters of the Roman prosecutors including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is used for evening concerts and opera performances today.
Tourists, for the word
If you are going to Israel, you don’t have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population speaks in this country.
On the way, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for cheques (now it is about $3.8 cheques).
City transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem and in the city of Haifa is the only subway line in the country with six stations that connect the lower city with the upper.
It is essentially a underground lane trail.
Travelling with all kinds of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, which you can drive 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, it is the Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sun west on Saturday, it stops working in markets, stores and public transport.
And on Sunday morning it starts a working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you only get a basket of meals: except pig meat, seafood, fish and dishes that contain mixtures of milk and meat.
They offer a wide selection of foods from lamb and cattle meat, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cash hummus, various types of beans, bowls of mild chickens - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs in the streets of Israel.
Therefore, there are a lot of caterpillar cats here that are graciously "toil according to their taste".
In the evening, you can see how you sleep on the rooftops of parked cars.
The leading cats love popular places, and with taste they go into every kind of goodness.
Car rentals will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $ 188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80) according to the brand.
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And lending a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
Numbers expressed
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Knowing the country and relaxing was accepted by most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"Great and Powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money for language
While Members and Ombudsmans are still discussing the law on compulsory language tests, frauds who sell "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country
13 million foreign workers arrive each year in Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, a law has entered into force, under which every migrant who is working will be obliged to submit an examination of the knowledge of Russian language.
To date, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that the appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors over time.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Language knowledge will also be confirmed to obtain and extend work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to people who have succeeded in achieving a certificate and obtaining an academic diploma to the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Use, Condemnation and Protection of Rights
The network of testing sites will work under the protection of the Puškin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can carry out tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are now opened in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by the State Duty and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law entered into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: what will it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So, above all, - responds representatives of the migration service - it will allow to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "child labor."
Many people today are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, Russian FMS president Viktor Sebelev explains.
The protection of their rights should already be initiated from their departure.
Only the system of organized collection will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems occur in migrants without professionals, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language, Sebelev says, the future migrant is condemned to conflicts with unfaithful people who will help him to provide "indications" to the terrible, narrow hostels in which he will be and dozens of others, like him himself, to spend the whole months without food and documents, and to spend up to 12 hours on the day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise one thing in their country, but when they arrive, they will be deceived, they will entertain their passports, they will not pay the promised wages," said Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tasmanian labour migration head.
Don't give up!
Less than many citizens of Central Asian republics, who intend to marry for work in Russia, recognize not only that they don’t know the language of the country they want to get to, but they don’t even have experience with that work.
Of course, it is not their fault as much as the disaster: very few Turkmen, Uzbekistans, and Tadžikistans can be allowed to gain at least reasonable basic education.
Because their families also need something to feed children, not talking about the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped to school.
As children are aged at a productive age, they must be prepared for work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliation and less value."
It is true that, in view of the law on linguistic tests, human rights defenders indicate one important thing.
The testing will only be carried out in those migrants who have a legal status.
If they do not have it, they do not have any tests or any other official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unaccepted Entrance is Banned"
Many of the incoming employees claim that getting an official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason - bureaucratic barriers and all those language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police officers know that we have essentially fake documents, without registration, and that leads to cases of release.
"They require a hundred, two cigarettes, tea," he shared with journalists about their experiences from Tadžikistan citizens Umed Chuškadamov.
"Don't be ashamed, buy a painting."
On the first day of the Language Act, it was found that there were not only migrant registration documents.
FMS employees have already engaged several fake certificates for the completion of the language exam.
Fake documents are printed on ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get free of charge: each migrant in the hope of making the problem so easy with testing, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
It is two-and-a-half times higher than completing an official test: it will cost migrant workers 3,000 rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to ensure the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, in that they are in line with government officials and human rights defenders.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed to test for the first time will take the time to complete the basic Russian language course.
Visitors who do not know Russian are supposed to work in areas where no active negotiation with people is required.
MVD (Internal Ministry) does not bring into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of criminal offences using legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents a proposal for a disruption of the law regarding civilian weapons owners.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the underlying were the cases of shooting on weddings, which were not victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban wearing dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which we can obtain a license for wearing weapons - from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea is supported by Irina Jarovaj, head of pride in the Committee on Security and Combat Corruption, who promised that changes to the Arms Act will be presented to the State pride in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian governments are trying to deal with the problem by the way of "sliping screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the refusal of the law of "unsense destruction".
The percentage of swallowing with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed using firearms by registered authorities of the Ministry of the Interior in the six months of 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of an open letter are convinced that the disruption of civilian weapons legislation does not require criminals to move to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can now be found at a low price in Moscow.
The Ministry of the Interior is currently saying that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from race to officers
The "black" market with weapons is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Barannec, who has been working for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Stadium.
Screenshot of the website that receives gun orders
The first of them - "Army or Military Road", is a weapon that was cut off during the fights on the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by the Russian officials and the Caucasus themselves,” says Larnaca.
Another type of "black weapons" is the weapons stolen by criminals from security forces.
Baranek explains that there are also thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly by employees of criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" is available for sale from military stocks.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It has been proven that some fires have been deliberately founded - so that the lack will be covered," said a former soldier.
Their contributions are made according to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturers.
"There are currently private arms companies that are not competitive in the international market and are throwing out weapons that are delivering to the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the “black” market is swallowing.
A large number of guns and machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are made here in the painting plant, and there is a mafia that organized their gas production," a former soldier explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have figured out what is the approximate share of individual sources of illegal weapons supplies to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was conducted in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists have collected reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Bureau of Statistics, Criminal Literature, and data from public data portals focused on the theme of weapons.
The majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were attacked on the black market "with the guilt of officials whose work is associated with weapons," the report said.
According to data that researchers have available, 17% of weapons originated from armed conflicts, 14% of weapons stealing occurred in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
A dealer-consultant of one of the arms stores who asked us not to specify his name is convinced that the weapons found in black "archeology" wasn't buying for a long time - they're simply too old.
Most often, as they say, sellers are driving for new shipments directly to military stocks.
Despite the deputy, the recipient buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You'll order a gun to him and he'll sell it to you through a plot.
"He will bring it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros for a piece of two warehouses," he says.
"The right is that the police are good in the picture, and therefore, whenever they begin to burn the plan in clarity of criminal offences, they will make a control purchase of illegal weapons traders," the advisor said.
"As in a luxury shop"
Sellers with the buyer most often find each other through their familiar.
I visited the websites and blogs until a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Experimental" platform, where there will be a man who would lead me to the "Spot" where we will act together.
I found the price mostly out there.

If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, the seller tells me - a adviser.- I have such a friend, but I don't trust him completely.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanoviče, who asked me to make the daughter fall out of the teeth."
And now I'm going through the man I'm sure.
He'll give me only because he knows I don't know him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Ex-soldier Viktor Baranyec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working to publish this topic.
The schemes did not change according to his words.
They gave him the album with pictures where he was "everything you thought about."
"I felt like a luxury shop," the soldier recalls.
To the buyer, according to the words of the Lamb, they do not offer incense in the cake - all you can try.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we're going with the seller to the forest and we're going to build a field.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I believe that the gun is shooting well, we start acting," the expert said.
Reservoir on the sofa
Search engines will take you to the websites and groups to "Contact" where you are offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
There are no documents or personal meetings to do so.
"It's worth having a fixed amount of money," they write in the advertisement title on the website "Buy a fighting gun or machine."
Users leave their notifications on this website and ask questions.
What about the sale of minors?
"Of course, without a license," the user is asked "Ivan" (the law is preserved).
"I'm buying TT.Moscow" - shortly formulated the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently decided a huge network of hard-websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can pick up a lopato.
People are hungry like hungry fish in the flood and then get coal in Siberia.
Military reporter and senior military positioner Viktor Baranéc
I have heard about such schemes: websites are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian laws.
People get orders.
The buyer will make payments through a banknote.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description of the directions where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitri Kislov, a press spokesman of the NGO.
Viktor Baranyec confirms that after ordering on the website, you can stay free of weapons and find yourself behind the networks.

Macarov for $100
When purchasing illegal firearms, you will pay the estimated amount of specialists usually from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislova from the NGO "The Right to Gun" you'll get the Makarov gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for a month and a half.
The weapon is expelled from stocks for long-term storage through stocks of the middle article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period of January - October 2011, and was 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of explained cases of theft and destruction of weapons, bombs, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
Fastfood and supermarket workers in the United States
"McDonald" will go through up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and in popular fast-food restaurants such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will be transformed into a nine wave or whether it is soon condemned to disappear.
All this action is supported by trade unions and a number of left social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages received by many employees in Walmart and in rapid dining systems, the aim of protest organizers is to achieve the creation in them in their trade organizations.
Currently, the economic sector is practically uninfluenced by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The events started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, killed millions of people and in some cases were accompanied by kidnappers.
This day, some employees of Walmart, who work for 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplace and demonstrated with trade unions and left activists of transnational business chains companies whose goods are intended for people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, ranging from bulbs to hunting bulbs and car batteries to dryers, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid employees in Walmart stores only shop at work.
The availability and range of goods have made Walmart’s chain one of America’s largest companies.
According to critics, Walmart may allow it to sell goods so inexpensively partially because only few pay their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic cars or manual scanners.
The protesters on "black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee receives $9.5 per hour, but it does not correspond to the height of expenditure, employees say.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley show that if Walmart raises an average salary of $12 per hour, it will cost $3.2 billion a year.
It is an average of 1.1% more than this company currently spends on wages.
If Walmart moves the salary increase entirely on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will only state by 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will lose about $ 12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s defenders point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and society should not cause virtually any harm.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8:00 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Its total cashes took place in nearly 100 million transactions in Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman said in an interview for the left-oriented Huffington Post website that the jobs left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was everywhere "a further media sensation" organized by trade unions.
"Unoccupied cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart’s business houses (those in the said advanced city aren’t too popular and therefore they’re almost not here), but “McDonald” and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn’t even pay you sickly and he doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
It currently makes a minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and New York State regulations of $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average their number of New York employees receive $8.90 per hour.
There is no lower wage in this precious city.
I don’t understand how you can live in New York City for such money.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who are working at the table after school for part-time and living with their parents will be employed at McDonald’s.
Only few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
Currently, I’m constantly meeting with "McDonald" employees who complain that they have to live for these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, a commentary on the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Protest participants who started at 6:30 a.m. at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue on Thursday morning asked for cash and cookers in fast-food businesses to start receiving at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also asked for the establishment of trade unions in the field of fast dining.
The U.S. laws prohibit government to defend the establishment of trade unions and punish activists of the trade movement by shaking and dismissal.
On the other hand, reporting helps them rarely make life easier.
However, introduction of fast food in the businesses of the trade unions is complicated for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extraordinarily high fluctuation of employees.
Nesouhlas
There were also noise protests on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The outbreak of this event was in the afternoon meeting at "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, particularly a member of the City Council Jumane Williams, said "McDonald" is selling billions of portions, and then not paying you a sickness and not paying you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also looking forward to supporting other prominent New York Democrats, such as Bill de Blasio's Mayor, who said, "we must intervene together to support fastfood workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the American sphere of fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, although not all of them were fast-food employees who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It seems that this event will become a certain time that will blow the flame of the mass movement, it's still unclear.
“The brain can lie on average.”
Among the fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular topic of expanded reality; recently it means seeing the world especially through the edges of special glasses.
At the beginning of the year, Google presented the work model of the news to its annual conference, and in November it was announced that the application for the respective patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
In an interview with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim, it shows that glasses are already past for scientists.
It is a perspective of virtual object manipulation in the air with holes of hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us the framework about what your research team is concerned?
We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has seen at the stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, at least sometimes touching the finger screen.
We want to look at 5-10 years in advance and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is for sale today without Kinect sensors, because for all there is a very interesting option to manage using gestures.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
Despite the fact that Kinect has transferred interactions to a physical level, a lot of interactions still occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts a greater amount of data), but the input flow has not yet been particularly important.
We try to change this, we work on really three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projectives.
It is necessary to enter the computer world into our physical world, to make it more realistic.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to supplement virtual objects in the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all - fucking with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it?
"It is certainly not possible to be considered as a general," the question of privacy arises because we do not always want to inform others about our activities and intentions in our surroundings.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, in order to control the equipment in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not of interactive, only of such shorts, shorts.
The gesta would not dream of a camera device, but a necklace that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it’s big, but it can be reduced by the size of the clocks.
However, in general, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- And how?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this lemon plate?
You'll say it, and you'll show it at the same time.
Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can detect the reaction of a person more accurately.
For example, these can be laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.
- If you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or anything else today?
In essence, the current generation – that’s what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s speed.
But it's not just about megapixels alone, it's like matrix and depth.
At the same time, all current technologies are insufficient for us - it assigns the work to algorithm designers.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So very important is the speed, the number of images per second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and the current data flow of 30 images per second is honestly a little bit, especially for gesta.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay in length of 1 to 100 ms, while current, serial-made sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects the interaction of a person with the machine.
For me, it would be a very useful equivalent of such a device at work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some pictures per second.
Is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
"The Kinect system now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And already the third camera - it's actually a common sensor of visible strip.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worse it because it would increase the required volume of calculations carried out.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with the camera location curling and see how it will help to determine a three-dimensional position.
If I remember, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Do you not think that when it comes to everyday use of expanded reality technology using special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, walking and constantly keeping smatphones in your hands is not too comfortable, but I think: the most powerful variant would be the "portable" image of reality expansion when it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphone, projection screen and around.
Glasses - it is a very personal device, there is their strength (private things you only see), and also weakness at the same time - expanded reality based on glasses does not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touching response!
His hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
“In my lectures I often say that expanded reality is the seventh interference between man and machine.
I think complementing the bulbs could calmly become the eighth blow.
So far one of the interesting tricks is used - using the second hand as a certain type of base for display.
It records compression in a great way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding the matteness to these "air images" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound rays at a defined point where the finger is located, it triggers the matte feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you'd climbed to the finger bar.
There is also a belt belt that affects nerve finishing in your fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you ever tried to defeat your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that will be struggled for a long time - how to force a person who is physically located in a very sharp space to believe that he walks in an open, practically infinite space - we also work on the concept of runways (not like at all in the clubs), moving corners and platforms as well.
If brain fake becomes a goal, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so attractive for researchers - a lot of things are at the beginning.
Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petersburg Avantgarde", dedicated to citizens who are in front of it, are the avantgarde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant characters of the sculpture scene of Petrohrad, whose eras exceed the frame of the city, often found recognition in Europe without reaching a universal announcement.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is the incredible designer Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a young man who is fully dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in the fashion hosts and on the vernis.
The pictures of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract the audiences.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical speakers of Petrohrad, the creator of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is an apparent man of the Petrohrad avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his manifestation in the streets tries to smile in the face of citizens, increases all moods.
Recently, he took a bottle and became a Petrohrad bottle, because he matured in this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyrile, why are you walking through the whole city in red, not in yellow, or, for example, in Turkish?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although in general, it is true that everything that only differs a little from grey, awakens aggressiveness and awakens bad properties.
But my provocations are aimed at showing a conversation.
The entire history of my provocative actions is primarily the invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you have to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nietzsche, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my way is.
Then a wave of old free informal artists passed over and I couldn’t understand the new, free types of artists.
I was friends with the artists of the new waves, with the post-gazonnevs who brought us to the "Puškinsky 10", and there were no other waves.
It lies to theatre, clothing, music, to all genres except words.
- And all this was in your art clinic...- It was important for me to sit in the center of the culture of Peterburg where they should gather all the best forces of creativity.
In 1995, I occupied a place at the Puškinsky 10, and there was a music-art club, a Bohemian club, a home of Peterburg Bohemian.
There were many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Snura brought with the project "Ear van Gogha".
The snur and his friends singed lightweight songs, dressed in adjacent tricks, in the middle of them the composer Igor Widow, who is now in fashion.
When the chapel started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hal-Galivia Times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, so he began his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the sound of Art Clinic.
Our employees and hosts left here.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture was something else.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press, a special price was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed, so I finished my top.
In new times according to old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In the present years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my pictures - these are hits in which actuality and penetration are captured lively.
I'll have a program exhibition "The Russian Museum in the Clowns".
Clowns are a pre-time category.
I've been a socialist, today it's so painful and terrifying.
But in the clans, everything goes down, tragic.
I love the grotesque, I have great ideas.
For example, to save the world by the way of totalitarian reconstruction in order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, focus on external mechanics, not on the inner man.
Or maybe he can't get his hand and he's got to swim in his face.
And the lie will be removed by clothing.
- We've seen you recently as a city bottlener. - The cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be if I don't?
Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactical, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
In the past, people met in the fools, Bohema loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken into micro-sociation, today it is very difficult to love everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar banknote to like everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has its 100 fans.
- And there will be thousands of viewers on Stas Mikhail!
- Fans come to him, there's a sexual social sphere.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land, and 10,000 will not come to the land, and the result is less management, money, everything will be ruined.
I've got fans, the main thing is that nobody's neoklame and doesn't break what's upset.
When I was young, I had little pictures that wearing on the wall with Falk and Larion at one collector.
I started with pictures that people usually end up.
Nowadays, people often make concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it has been removed.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for paintings.
And I am for such a culture.
- Cyrile, what's the lack of Peterburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is such a concept: an agent over culture.
Not all of them can engage in culture.
During the time of the real emperors, it was not in all, the emperors might not understand the culture too much, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
At us in Petrohrad we have people who might be experts, but they are trapped somewhere in the corner, because they need great experts who correctly appreciate these experts and take them on the right path.
Today the taste is prosperous.
The same Erart, but it differs sincerely by saying that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think is Peterburk?
"Petersburg - it's not the capital city of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And in our ears, art is bad.
We need cultural land, but we have more than readers today, that's bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are jealous who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have such a layer of weakness.
We need the art to become a fashion matter, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented under the grant of St. Petersburg
Born in the Space
The land is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a suicide asteroid.
The caravans of cosmic curves on board are going on the way, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in conditions of difficulty or on a substitute planet?
I don't think the choice is great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if it is hypothetical.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a highly built scientists of the State Institute of Astronomy P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better living conditions on Mars, Venus’ surface temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live there in a large height or on the orbit of Venus... in the universe.
Resolving the issues of reproduction in the universe began by scientists with flora.
Half a century ago, tests on plants were made.
The four generations of games grown on the roundways are nothing different from their landslides.
Then the inhibition was carried out on the orbit - very small fruit mushrooms of Drosophila.
In 1979, it was sent to the universe to verify how the embryo is developing in a state of difficulty.
At the exit we get an absolute normal bird.
But then the problems start.
“A problem that this bird has to find resistance is to build on its own legs and begin to move,” says RAN Vladimir Syčev, head of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP).
Unless they find resistance, the birds fall chaoticly and make cowboys.
After 10 hours, freshly cleaned birds have completely destroyed instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the difficulty was that they just died within four days.
"We let the birds go twice, but then we refused it because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev comments on the failure of a chicken experiment in the universe.
The last "miniarch" had been flying on the circular path 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
In biosatellite "Bion" but there will only be beings of one gender.
A experiment was conducted with rabbits that were broadcast into the universe already pregnant.
There was basically nothing overnatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts must be carried out," said Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground, the spacecraft were born descendants.
Nevertheless, approaching the problem of reproduction directly in the universe has not yet succeeded.
It's a hard task.
Animals can’t realize their sexual instincts when they lose the usual environment.
A person, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens governs abstract thought and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not conducted.
Women are flying into the universe for 50 years.
The greatest dangers were threatened by Tjerkovo.
The most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our Tea has fled, and no one on Earth could say if it would take flight to the universe.
Will he be able to give birth to a child after such a flight?
"No one has answered this question yet," says a rocket-space veteran of Vachtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into the universe, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tjerres' daughter, was born.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolajev.
In 1988 was born the son of the second woman-cosmonaut of Lightlana Savicka, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in an open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born after long years and have grown in the health of the descendants.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," said the spacecraft pilot, Hrdina of the Soviet Union and Hrdina of Russia Valerij Poljakov.
Humanity must, however, inevitablely seek new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions with zero attraction, the cosmonauts take the habits necessary to work in an open space.
The water resembles the state of difficulty.
Although for adults, water is to be comfortable, but in its way strange environment, for small children, it is a natural life.
Little ichtians seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a relationship between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the mother’s fertile water, and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first waste, it only takes two weeks.
"It's very little to make the baby forget something," says the newborn swim instructor Marina Aksenov.
In short, if the newborn baby is more difficult for a natural condition, then for women is more natural inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In a state of difficulty, the abdomen muscles, the pan muscles, the ability of the body to excrete the fruit, occurs very quickly.
We can leave this side if muscle stimulants are working during childbirth.
Finally, it is possible that the birth occurs in a special chamber in which the organism of the mother is excreting the fetus.
"What about the next?" asked Valerij Poljakov with difficult questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If Earth’s attractiveness does not affect the organism, it cannot properly shape the muscles or the system.
A newborn on the circular road is not possible to dress as an adult in a special dress loads in which he can train.
He will simply get rid of what he needs for his unconditional development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a health-cared person to the Earth who will be completely intact to the environment here," predicts IBMP's bioethics chief RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
But once will the time come when they become a reality and when the earthly ones will be released into their beasts on a remote planet that will become the home of their descendants born in the universe.
NKÚ: Control of the swash system failed to blame politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but is in its application.
In an interview for Aktualmente.cz, this is said by Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think is missing in us," Kala said.
Similar conclusions also indicate the common control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter’s approach to the so-called “svarcs system” is indicated.
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not disturb the entrepreneur with his controls - is it therefore prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be set in a way, and if something prohibits it, then neither the president of the government can prevent the activity of the office which is responsible for carrying out control and execution of duties," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Parliament, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and the German side, which compares legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply speaking, the European legislation regulates the way public procurement is addressed, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have given this all together, and although the control has not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, legislation may be even "more accurate and more perfect" with us, yet the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more accurate rules, but it is necessary to devote itself to the application of law.
What can this project actually help you to do what will come out of it for you?
Just such a common control could contribute to stop making efforts to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the limits, if this does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means obtaining an appropriate thing for reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, if possible, criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the limit of contracts, we don’t have to achieve this.
Perhaps that system will be swallowed by such a amount of paper that those who want to look for holes in that system will get them much easier than if the limit remains higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office here similar to our NKU, or is it differently set?
As for the authorities, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, has also a college, only forms a little different way, but in principle both authorities act similarly.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but the fact that Germany has federal arrangements is that of the accounting courts at the level of the individual federal countries - this system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can only control the federal funds represented by us by the state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by our country and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
What about the legislation there, is it so simpler than ours?
In general, I wouldn't like to compare it without specific data, however, in some ways Germany is considered a pattern, but it can't be said that it's better in everything.
Is it necessary to have better controllers?
No, but I say again, I don't like that comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries we consider as a pattern are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, wouldn't it?
What about domestic legislation, which means the novel of the Public Procurement Act for your office, is already manifested in some way by its impact?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, we have not yet seen it in controls.
Because we do ex post checks, it is necessary to calculate a certain delay.
We have only observed this until now in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new "insolvency risk detection" tool through which we have searched nearly 14 thousand public procurement contracts, and we have analyzed them - these changes will, of course, be manifested because limits will change, conditions of certain types of tender procedures will be adjusted and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law rather beneficial, or any further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that the rules are "complete" and cannot be followed.
For the functioning of the previous rules, the controlled persons are bound by the provider (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act involves infringement of the budgetary penalty.
Does the law value this way?
I don't think this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who make formal doubts that have no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So what about it out of here?
Let's show you where the road does not go.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "Svarcs system" - and what does that mean?
Is the squad system prohibited or permitted?
However, the law must be set up in a way, and if something prohibits it, so that neither the president of the government can prevent the activities of the office which is responsible for carrying out control and execution of duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it," but he can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act there are relatively stringent rules on how to be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the beneficiary with the best offer is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think is missing in us.
The roads are cold, but mostly landing.
In a number of places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
But mostly cars are sliding, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovar
In the Karlovarsky landscape this morning, the roads were landing, but the places were frozen and also snowy.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it is slightly warmed.
The snow in the region was established and only a weak layer lies in the lowers.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the hills of Krušní Mountains.
The locations were also lower visibility due to the mosquito, resulting from the specification of the country's routers.
The R6 speed roads and first-class communications are now unlimited in the region.
Caution, however, is on the site, for example, on some overseas, where the surface can be wet and smooth.
There are also all roads of second and third class including mountain roads.
However, there are still remains of ice cream and places of snow in some sections.
Especially in higher locations, it is necessary to pay greater attention to driving.
Pardubian and Royal Warsaw Region
In some roads in eastern Czechoslovakia, in higher locations and mountains, a snow layer can be trapped on communications, informs the Roads and Roads Management on its website.
The motorists warn the drivers from the rail, it can be formed especially in the higher locations of the Pardubian region.
It can be located in the vicinity of Lanskkrouna, Orlicia, Polička, Svitav or High Myth, especially on roads of the second and third classes.
The roads I/43 and I/34 are chemically treated in Svitav.
The snow is particularly on the roads in the Krkonoší and the Orl Mountains.
The trapped snow layer is at the highest locations in the Rychnov districts over the Priest and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic, it is most commonly clear to sealed without precipitation.
The temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blowing.
Plzeň
The roads in Plzeňska kraji are landing this morning, but places with increased caution and ride need to be adjusted.
This is frozen after the wound, temperatures move between three to nine degrees below the frozen point.
After the previous snow and subsequent cooling, some communications can be cold.
The locations must also be counted by drivers, but the visibility will gradually improve.
This is based on the information of the country's roads.
The D5 road is almost unlimited, but increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the south of Plzensk and Tachovsk, however, there may be cold sections.
Communications of second and third class are wet, and also in this case a warning is applicable to cold cuts.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequented roads in the area of Schumava.
Olomouc country
Today, with a snowfall on the road, drivers who are heading to the highest position of the Olomouc region must be counted.
After the chemistry, she stayed on the Red Horse chair as well as on the way to the Videlski Cross.
The motorists dropped into the field in the night of snow, on the Shumpshire, according to the road managers, snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the country, cars are mostly landless.
“On the Schumpersk lies in the highest positions of snow residues.
The drivers must count in the direction of Autumn with a snow cake on the Red Horse chair,” said the TK-speecher of the Shumper Road Administration today.
Even at night, their colleagues in Jesenicka were expelled into the field, the roads to the highest positions are now considered to be naked and wet after chemical treatment.
On Olomoucka, roads are unlimited, but in Šternberska, drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the cars remain moist.
Ustecký Kraj, Liberian Kraj
Several difficult departure sites are reported to the road roads in the north of the Czech Republic today.
In addition to several places with the attacked snow or ice, the mountain road is also closed from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecka, resulting in the police database.
The temperatures are held even in lower locations below zero, so the ice and snow appear to endure on the roads.In the nine, especially southeast of the Czech Central, there are no problems on the contrary and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not been reported yet.
The occurrence of the ice is reported to the motorways, particularly from the area of Štěta.
According to meteors, there were ideal conditions for her at night - through the day and the snow, light and cold at night.
There are also reported adverse conditions on the road I/13 at the borders of the Ustick and Libereck region.
The lock from Telnice to Kninice was forced by the fastened branches of trees, which turned to the car under the snow.
Simon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think of the end of the world in a few months?
It’s just one of the other terrible news we like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make it more fun and say that we are the only chapel in the world that can accumulate enough positive energy to remove or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also organize a totally unique project with three concerts to the end of the world.
Can you present it closer to readers?
This is a national beneficial event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
On December 20th, at the same time, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
It will end when the May calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is within the time zone of 12 hours before us.
Who came with this idea?
At first, it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our designer Honzo Augusto.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we and the public also want to think about the state in which this world is once transmitted to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing on www.e-tap.com.
The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang a so-called hymn against the end of the world, called "The End of the World Abolished".
She is very popular on YouTube today, will she be playing on these favourite concerts too?
Of course, in the full conclusion, that is, if we all succeed and the end of the world will not happen...
They are all singing at all three concerts at the same time.
The hymns are also connected in a unique direct streaming on the Czech TV.
The words of this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomáš Hanak, singing in it Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other Czech cultural scene characters, given that we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts...
We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.
Most of them have been interested in and enjoyed with us.
What will be the result of the concerts to the end of the world?
At the equipment of the Studeo’s barrier-free education center, which we have been implemented for six years with the Tap Civil Association in Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedličkova institute regularly attend the doctors and devote themselves to activities that they have fun and are interested in.
Students themselves don’t have the means to publish themselves, so we try to allow them to do so.
Within the framework of the construction of the Jedlič’s Constitution in the future, separate buildings will be created to which we will move with this project.
There will be several music groups and interpreters at each concert.
By what did you choose them?
We have tried to create a program that will address all generations including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bártou, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Dry will appear in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombs" in the future?
In May, we will be presenting for the first time in Prague Spring, so we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests here.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are already in the US, I would like to link it to the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group that is composed of hendikous people.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organizationally?
It's not as terrible as it looks at first glance.
We have five members on an electric carriage, its carriages must travel in the luggage space, and we, of course, draw a large amount of cargo and bean with tools.
Nevertheless, so far it has always managed without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were greatly prepared for us to see how many times I was surprised.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to travels abroad, you can compare how individuals vary in barrier routes, public access to hindues and so on.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than with us, we were witnessed just in Russia that everything is still at the very beginning in the east.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barriered, there is still unusual to move on the electric car itself in the city centre.
There is no such thing as, of course, that you prefer the drivers in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already a civil association that is trying to warn the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, do we still have to do a more advanced country?
There are a lot of things in which we are still behind...
However, it is important to note that improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people to whom it is concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that even people with heavy hendikep move on-site to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they go.
But it’s not so usual that a lot of people with disabilities would participate actively in social life, on the contrary, we’re with The Tap Tap a little before!
Respecting the public or barrier is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers are going to change things.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The Cape The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years ago what made you build it in 1998?
I went to the Jedlič’s Constitution as an educator, where I had many young people around me who had an interest in something to devote.
And as I am a musician, I play a saxophone among others, so I and my colleague founded an interesting music ring.
Well, over time, as our moderator Lady Angelovich says, we have a bit out of the hand (laughs).
Did the popularity come over the past few years, or was it wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started connecting with famous singers and also actively working on the promotion of the team.
We found that work that is not seen is essentially as if it weren’t.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can also allow quality readers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning I felt the potential for something else to be done.
Showbusiness is overwhelmed with things where one simulates the other.
It is logical in its way, everything new is accepted carefully and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique are very few, but I hope to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression in the person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it is natural.
But this regret is totally unnecessary, because people with the hendikep are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full-time life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary resources to do so.
I say that when something happens to people with a hendikep, it's not just a move for them, it's a move for the whole society.
Did this also help you to be a strict boss, how many people pointed out?
When we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require certain discipline.
But I think that's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the test twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time on their journeys to concerts, the excitement quickly leaves.
This is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap chapel has twenty members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only the only Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, it can't be avoided.
Whoever has the will and the taste, always has the doors open to us.
The day before the expected end of the world will take place on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21h
It will take place in the Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fleda and Ostrava Gasoime for 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will join the telemost at the end of the evening at the joint song of The Tap Tap "The End of the World Abroad"
The aim of the concert is to collect funding for the equipment of the STUDEO multifunctional barrier-free education center at the Jedličk Institute in Prague in a volume of 25 million Kč
Entry to the concert is £400, children under the age of 12 have free tickets in the pre-selling Bohemiaticket
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was adopted as a twenty-fourth member of the European Space Agency, as a second country from the former East Block countries (as a full-time member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of agency projects over the next few years.
However, the journey of Poland to space has begun a lot earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were devoted to space flights before World War II, but not always met with understanding.
For example, I remember the lecture of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw astronomical observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entry into cosmonautics.
The thoughts of a young engineer (born 1905) left listeners cold and after years Šternfeld reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha prize for Space Age in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautics and his benefit was also awarded by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named in his name.
In 1925, a railroad was built in Poland, which had to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used for the departure of the rod or for its noise.
Information about this drawer is only known for daily printing.
Since 1933, rocket shots began to take over Polish armor.
The research was provided by Cell Technik of Arms in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustawe Mokrzyckieg.
It is evident that research has gone into the stage of practical tests.
However, the arrival of the German army was discontinued.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric rocket was found in the press, which was proposed by Rohoziński engineer, and the following year the work of Rakiet - air turbine and air turbine was released by the author of Leliwy-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy) was dedicated to all projects for military use of missile techniques, which coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of its operations it ended the start of the war.
Other work devoted to cosmonautics appear after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of The Problems magazine, which contains four more extensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is designed to create a company that will engage in cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects have already been launched and it was clear that space research is a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has strived to enter the International Astronaut Federation (found in 1951) and has become a regular member in the autumn.
And in the following year, the first PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice President of the International Astronaut Federation.
He stopped this function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Meteorologischna), which has become the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a reach of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
The RM-1A improved version was later built and in the summer of 1959, the Bledov Desert flight tests of two-stage RM-2 missiles were launched.
The missile was 1.4 meters long and its weight was approximately 11.5 kg.
Another development type had already been capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 missile had access to up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor height wind.
However, in 1962, further development was suspended.
The first RM missile was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed that differed in the size of space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A missile there was a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, he developed the Meteor-2 missile at the Air Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry useful loads of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAU (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second inter-cosmonaut after Vladimir Remk.
Abolition of the law on public practice is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public practices.
The resolution led to a live discussion to the public.
It will certainly be interesting to take a look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalized world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the individual economic services, the national economic systems, are in a permanent conflict between them.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, nothing unlimited in the movement of private capital, along with unforgettable financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in the price of labour, (measurement) occurs in price voltage.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the condition in which the producer seeks to remain in competition with importing cheap goods by “compliant” the price of the competitor in order to draw more market share on himself and thus increase its own profits.
In the mass, it means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production abroad, or to buy cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility and, therefore, the responsibility for unemployment generated by it, the state’s social expenditure is necessarily growing.
The whole situation strengthens the absolute independence of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus replace the economic and social harm that has resulted in gains.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Infringement of private capital practices create a situation in the individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital all their own population, regardless of social collapse.
This is especially true in the changes to the laws in force.
The objective is economically to force the private capital’s price dictatorship, especially in the field of salary.
This is the same with the system of economic enforcement in the case of long-term unemployment, and the same with the limitation of workers' rights in the field of employment law.
The result is growing poverty along with the increase in differences between poor and rich.
In the SRN, there are many years of public food expenditure for the poor who cannot enjoy their own work.
The number of these people is already to millions.
Within the framework of an increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common in cases that properly employed people receive such a salary that the state has to pay them to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal has been published even in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Chamber.
Sustainable measures of almost all Southern EU countries will certainly lead to the same state when people under the pressure of disastrous social defeat are forced either to migrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages on the edge of society in the hope that private investment capital may once come to the country.
We need to ask where it comes from.
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty is moving from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because China, India, Brazilian, Turkey, Morocco, Egyptian, or Africa are still working for breaking European wages.
That's all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media are saying that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy that the governed economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital of the swap holds the view that the State should not interfere with the economy by managing interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, now it is actually governed by politics and thus by the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer already yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually all-powerful lobby in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is criminal, but nothing is criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is so that the state ministry for the lack of funds introduces draft laws to private legal firms that are lost in connection with the industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All such powers come not from people as western constitutions declare, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting into the situation, as Appiános describes it in its work in the Roman Republic Crisis during the times of Caesar and Pompeia: “The State has long been in full disintegration and the authorities have been involved in violence.
For payments, unlawful gaining honesty and with the use of stones or swords.
Subpayments and corruption were without any prohibition and the people went to elections with a pre-selling voice" ..." characteristic people weren't talking about the office at all, so once it was as a result of this disruption was a state of eight months without consulates." ..but the man's sense of power began to talk about the energy itself, and the sense of power began to say that the only remedy in the situation was bad.
Conclusion Like in ancient times, the present company is based on the unprecedented preferences of its own benefit regardless of the general interest.
Private capital is no longer able to understand and apply the overall benefit of society.
The result is now, just as at that time, the unfair decade of elite without any effort to reform the deeper races.
We must therefore seek the causality of the emerging of the fascist and communist regimes in the uncertain liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state, the destruction of these systems in favor of liberal democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of another wheel.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites completely ignore the potential loss of thousands of lives in the future, humanitarian and social disasters, which we now witness together with crimes against humanity, as known from old and new history.
Abolition of the law on public practice is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition, both internationally and within Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is aimed at political and social reforms that will strengthen state capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken monopoly position of private capital in the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes from violence and can't ever" Sting in Fragile's song, whose main verse in the refren is "Let's forget how we're crushed."
"If my sons wouldn't want war, there wouldn't be any of the dead Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849."
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
One stands behind Israel, arguing his right to self-defense, and Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed by the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel match the role of the terrorist state.
I don’t want to think about who is in the periodic waves of the murder of the victims and who are victims, and who are the inhabitants of today’s Israeli people, including self-governmental territories, who have been born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
It is meant to offer readers a look at the rear, a look at the one that has been serving the 95-year-old voltage (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the historical facts available, some of them are drawn from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main hideout of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the history of the battle for power.
At any time, we can follow some of that Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether they were always those personalities, who were fully autonomous to manage their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who targeted their actions to the advanced goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the powers resulting from them could not have occurred for the life of one generation.
Among these astronomically-rich families is one that can be considered the head of a turtle (if someone still stands above them, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschield.
It's not much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) purchased in the 1990s to stop connecting their names with high criminal acts in which they were standing and which always indicated the strengthening of power, the multiplication of wealth or both.
They have the main shares in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where the shares in the central bank do not lead or prepare wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the collapse of Kadhafi, but Russia was undergoing the central bank government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank of Rothschieldo Bank of America, began spending his own (governmental) money during the civil war and was killed in the theatre in 1865.
JFK began spending its own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered in 1963, and Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to accuse the FED of resolving the major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate the plan of three world wars by the winner of the highest, 33th degree of consecration by Albert Pick.
The first war had to remove large monarchistic state generals in Europe, the second had to remove colonial rule, particularly the UK, and the third had to lead to a reduction in the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury are sufficient and do not consume so much of absolute resources), the creation of a predecessor of such a universal religion.
The method that a group of the richest families in front of Rothschieldy works is to create a crisis and subsequent offer of solutions (order ab chao - the order of chaos).
However, these solutions are fake and always lead to worsening the situation (see FED founding to avoid recovering the crisis such as the crisis caused in 1907).
So, after they had succeeded in killing the Habsburg successor R-U of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to dissolve the First World War, they destroyed Imperial Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, military and economically non-essential, capitalizing Germany (no war needed to destroy Imperial Russia) and subsequently a devastating central European power, Austria, occurred.
To make it easier for the Second World War, the bankers of politics to create a latent conflict situation by introducing huge war repairs in Germany, creating the assumption of radicalization of the burdened mass, and then it was sufficient to underscore the colonization of the Germans, the multi-powerful, the multi-function of the Germans, the criminals that mark the war, and the simple solution of the very power.
At the end of the nineteenth century Rothschield's founding of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (the return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration has already created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, beginning with the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War emerged, if Hitler escaped from the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or everything he did was hard to estimate, any suffering of European Jews in concentrations constituted a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany's war repairs started for World War II, a third war fire was created by the State of Israel.
If international bankers manage to dissolve it, the Jewish nation, like in the second, will be victims of battles in the first line, now together with the Arab or general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a source of weight and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (we will only consider how strong people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli conflict, where the curve produces the curve in the endless chain of violence, when the chastisement of individuals and their desire for global power was at the beginning?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers emphasize people to choose exclusively their own candidates in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, to international bankers loyalty, a policy that does everything in order to dissolve a war with Iran, which would, due to the membership of Iran in Shanghai, the world-wide global organization that is widespread in terms of cooperation (China, India, the world-wide conflict, the world-wide government, the world-wide government and the world-wide government.
David Rockefeller said in 1994: “The only thing we need is the general crisis and people will agree with the new world order.”
The new world order in their view is the world of masters and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves the convenience of financial aristocracy.
The world where every newborn person is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a totally controlled being.
And he causes all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave and the free, to buy or sell, whose name is not marked, or the number of its name.
You need to understand this: who is wise to count the numbers of the beast.
This number indicates a man, and it is the number sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he captured the U.S. Embassy of Islamist students and captured 52 diplomats as an army.
They had to be released in exchange for the shake of Mohamed Rézu Páhlaví, who, after the revolution, fled to the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive east – she could not allow herself to throw a shake across the board, as it would substantially threaten the confidence of allies in other countries.
But in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, it was unable to achieve.
It was a wound to the United States prestige, which later deepened the failure of the attempt to free the handheld force.
The prisons of diplomats were finally released 444 days after the Algerian government had mediated the negotiations.
Their education at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
Debakl in Iran has significantly contributed to the loss of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in presidential elections in 1980.
The film of actress Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy, six employees escaped.
After complicated perpetrations, they ended in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran, helping the extravagant coverage of history - leaving Canadian passports as a member of the film stake, who watched the locations for the Sci-Fi film recording in the country.
Combination of genres
A plan, invented by an expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood cooperation.
To make the legend reliable, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, a press conference took place, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been secreted for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendes.
Affleckov's film is a special combination of several genres.
On one hand, a realistically captured political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a piece issued, the subtraction - an example can be Danny's series of partners.
In the film so the moods are changing - on one side the documentately captured sequence from Tehran (in the title sequence the iconic time photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in it).
On the other hand, sheltered passports from Hollywood, matched with irony and mild oversight.
And then still scenes from the CIA and other institutions - men in clothing are breaking up the situation at the trial tables, at the office walks, at the phone...
Ben Affleckov successfully restarted his career in a remarkable way.
From a smiled actress he became a respected director and his acting ceased to be a part of ironic notes.
Argo is his third full-time film, after the dark crimes Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck's photo to not take place in home director Boston.
It was one of the characteristics for the atmosphere of the place, which the director's older films exceeded the Hollywood standard.
Affleck also shows it in Arga where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are taking place in the streets, when reconstructing real events - the introductory sequence of the embassy falls is impressive in its transparency, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and invisibleness that occur when somewhere the devastating movement of history occurs.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve the same effect on the scenes of thought (fake stake on the Tehran base).
Too many stories in many places
The director had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of stressful scenes.
It is very successful to work with this little, sometimes it thinks something about reality - it doesn't go so elegantly (the scene where the threatening crisis at the Tehran airport turns off the phone call in America, and the snake after the rave seems pretty attractive to the hair).
The Arga’s weakness, however, is the dizziness resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood co-workers, but their characters would deserve more space and are not the only ones in that film far away.
Afflec's film is a little losing dramatically, it's a film that can be viewed with mild interest, appreciated the performance and retro style evoking thrillers in the 1970s.
It's hard, but it's hard.
As a reminder of one so far in a certain way of living history and evidence of how overwhelming the concepts of all-powerful and all-knowledge secret services, it is enough.
Rules for sweating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which declares an annual survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU factory".
“It led us to the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women led by major European companies,” said Patrik Nacher, Law organizer.
For example, among the nominated absurdities is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the rates of insurance for men and women.
So far, women have been favourable in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote will be held by the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulation also includes compulsory mixing of biocommodities into pollutants, which is due to nature harmful, further prohibiting the use of reliable resin temperatures only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of blinds, which reflects the eggs this year.
Critics previously also faced the actual ban on the use of the expression of anointed butter or the removal of classical lamps from sales.
Quality bananas have 14 centimeters
The Union’s apparatus often decides under the pressure of the business or industrial lobby, whose requirements are usually imposed in Brussels by a state or by a group of states (the Czech Republic is now and the veto threat is imposing the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, high-quality bananas had to reach at least 14 cm in the Union and should not show "alone curve".
However, the European Commission has defended itself by only harmonising the uncommon national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU's standards for fruit and vegetables have already melted through the resistance of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year’s EU regulation can also be a candidate for a win in the survey, which requires a warning that children under eight years of age should not be swallowed without the supervision of adults.
The EU has appealed to American research that balloons among the toys are the leading cause of children’s death to be drunk.
Similar limitations are now applicable to children under 14 years of age when flying into turtles.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rules on European officials themselves are relatively absurd - everyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia for Greece in view of the sensitivity of the theme and must talk about FYROM instead.
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, Laissez Faire has nominated the survey in addition to some of the above absurdities, such as the Union Regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amounts of food stocks that could be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volumes in conservation hubs, which threatened him a high penalty.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for their lack of sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on request for a grant.
However, these ideas did not occur in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are disabled by having no sea.
We are asking the European Union for refunds," said former Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that there was a lot of grain among us and, as a result of the so-called interventional purchases, the stocks that he had to export had to be paid.
For the fact that the Czech Republic has gone further to the ports, the EU has to pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to the Palais.
The European Commission finally released the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
The grants for obtaining were offered by the Municipal Ministry for Local Development, led by Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular to write a Brussels grant application.
EU: Byzantine regulations are an exception
However, in Member States, the regulations make it easy to make criticism, while the EU’s efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to improve the functioning and development of the whole of the Union deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
According to experts, a more serious problem is, for example, pumping EU subsidies on projects that have no sign of deepening European integration but which have been forced by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The emotion between the Czechs also encourages the fact that, as with other Union countries, the Czech Republic in Brussels must fight for the right to specify its traditional products, not always successful in this match.
After a six-year-old battle with the Germans and Rakušany, the Czechs threatened the marking of the olomous shapes, but the domestic space, the tradition of which we had in the nineteenth century, had to rename our manufacturers as foreigners.
The designation of rums can only be carried out by products made of corn distillate, not from sugar ripe.
In the official list of EU registered products, feta cheese and gorgonzola, Marchipan from the German Lübeck or parms have already been found in the company, for example, Carlovar droughts, pottery and turmeric cappuccino and jet chmel.
The EU trademark can also be proud of pardubical pearl and fire pipes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I am amateur, Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how do you attack a man who wants to appoint the president?
I don't care about being a senator or president.
If it would work in our country without any problems, I wouldn't be anybody else.
But I can't see how the last twenty years the earth is breaking down, how thieves run, people are increasing taxes and age of retirement.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to get a solution to change it.
And since I was forty years old and I am an independent non-partisan, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to apply for a senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you got the battles to the Temple.
Don’t you turn your back to the people who chose you?
All the time I said I would go to the battle for the Temple according to the result in the Senate elections.
Later, I stated that if I were elected Senator, I would be candidate for the president.
My goal, however, is not a function, it is a tool to accomplish my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the most powerful mandate.
The problem, however, is not only that as a nation, we deliver at home and on television, but that we send everyone who wants to try to change.
There are media that dishonour a man, and that make themselves free to lie with freedom of expression.
I may have been claimed to be a paying journalist or to be a consultant of Jiří Paroubka.
Let's go to your vision.
In the battle for the Hrad, you’ve defeated with the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and returning property confessions of more than twenty million.
You have to change the law.
You have no such power as president and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I was lobbying for guidance to be free life, and it was successful.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good suggestion to the left or right, the lawyer rejects, and the citizens refrain from it.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to obtain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party boxing and dogmats I can take something that is best for our country, from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-hand or left-hand person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people order me to the left.
It doesn't matter if it's a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go ahead.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solutions, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODS, and I will still be against bad thoughts.
You're sure when someone tells you that you're a populist.
But do you not prove that by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Someone may call it populism, but all the suggestions I am talking about are working in the world, or important experts have spoken about them.
But without Parliament's support, you will only have passwords.
You don’t have enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you follow people and talk to them, you will be able to take account of criminal and physical responsibility, for example?
I have no other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to promote it.
If I had been elected a president, it would not be a problem to organize a direct television transmission where I would ask the presidents of parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal responsibility for politics, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell me why they don't want her.
When there is a strong personality that will be called uncleans, it can be pushed on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the debt of public pressure.
At the level I say I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my views and visions, I'm trying to find an ally.
I’ve just started in politics and I’m trying to get a majority support for my program.
I'm trying to put things down alone, if it doesn't, I'm going to end in six years and I'm going back to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not doing anything in one person, so I've surrounded a number of known people, whether they would also be nominated to the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchura, who refused to do so much work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Janu Lorenc, who flashed fraud with light heat oils.
I've been candidating that people are really unhappy, but now I'm on the guards.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and those who went mostly chose the establishment representatives.
We are only two independents in the Senate.
People called the Senate so that the changes would be difficult to promote.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as for the direct choice of mayors or heighteners.
Are you considering the establishment of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the pure past of every potential party, and I don't even have money for it.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, but there's only 20,000 in my transparency account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
Private property is estimated to be about 60 million.
In Prague, I have the land for about 25 million, a ten-million apartment, another eight-million apartment, a collection of artworks for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and the Superb Schode for a million, and then I have a few million in account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyfriend's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, was brilliant to women and at the same time fought against evil and mischief.
You drive Aston Martin, you have a property of 60 million, and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want your own money to spend on it.
It's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I owe that?
I've got 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors indicates that I'm probably not interested in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign from my own.
The expenses for the campaign will basically cover me how I will receive a Senate salary.
But I wouldn’t survive it, for example, I couldn’t pay a child’s English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be anybody else.
So you're going to continue business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're blowing these activities?
But it does not relate to the amount of wages.
As I promised, I’ve been part of my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much did you like a entrepreneur get used to taking a month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'm going to take.
And if I were president, I would end my business.
You will find the entire interview in the Law edition on Saturday.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures are not only in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Mount of Books - 2 images
"This building looks happy to me, looks futuristic. Finally, it's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the nearby big business, says, "Of course, this house is nice."
I wonder what we need a library today.
Everyone has the internet, iPads and electronic books.
No one is going to go to any of these books in old style, right?
Spijkenisse, located close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities, which are not worth a visit, has a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted ironbeton miniatures of fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive wasn’t a disgrace.
And so the city councillors knew that there was just the only way to become the master of statistics: we have to have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural theater MVRDV, a master of crazyly brave column graphs and the builder of funny, often even cynic buildings, accepted something with ordinary calm and at the competition negotiations in 2003 appeared with five books under the sides and on the face.
And while the commission was still amazed to look around and kneel his shoulders, Maas made his gifts on his own according to the size and his actively justified speech ended with the words "Beautiful town town!"
So this is my suggestion on the Hora of Books in Spikenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed for €30 million.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, postal and several adjacent housing and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Hora was recorded by the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project was nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The little gray, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern walk zone and an unusually sharp mayor, behind which you would rather expect a milk farm, is richer in a slightly modern architecture.
But now Spijkenisse has the first public cultural building in its history.
A long way to the book
First impression: a reader's eldorado under a cheese cover.
The masive of the mountain, however, rides an elevator, but you will discover real spatial and reader passions as long as you walk into topography.
On the other hand, the glass interior is bright and transparent, the floor from a burning cabin and the elegant street lighters clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You can see park lions, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
Everywhere books, books, books.
"It normally stands with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is usually uncomfortable and unpersonalized," says Winy Maas.
We have built a classic spatial configuration upstairs legs and space for readers have been lifted out of the inside.
The inside of the Hory books is specially used: on Wednesday there are offices, internet library, shack club, ecological center and central home technology.
Special comforts are black tiles on books, which are once covered with walls, once with a parapet, and sometimes with stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are strange.
Over the unknown construction material, the heads of the architects and construction engineers are even enclosed.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials here,” says Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a question of Standard magazine.
So, in one Frisian farm, one day, we put an appropriate agriculture waste product.
For many years, it has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base under the roots of a millimeter rod of synthetic matter.
It is cheap and timely efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons and is then mature to be thrown into volume waste.
For the library, the roll - for the first time in such a quantity - was cut on boards with a thickness of four centimeters.
With light and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colors into dark, homogenous and loadable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps, you get to the top.
At the end of nearly 500 meters of long trip you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch crocodiles and figs in flowers.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly of the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You wouldn't believe this, but this house is a project for ecology in spite of many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
It warms up and cools with earth temperature.
Although Mount of Books stand under a glass cover, the sun shines within only a short time, even in sunny days.
Widely tied wooden connectors, which stand a rope to a glass facade, serve as shade and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The air condition in the room is very pleasant.
With the rest, you can handle fully automatic rollers.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even referred to as "the long-expected soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: every resident of the city was invited to open a few weeks ago to dedicate a book from his own personal fund.
So, first of all, it should be filled with the optical ladders in a not yet fully equipped library, which currently counts 70,000 pieces.
The concept proved.
The police are full.
“There’s nothing worse than a semi-free library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship to a new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she was just on the decoration.
This included MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the creation of identity in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
Whatever young and untrained.
This is finally the starting point for identity.
Sabo: "Germans have to play a greater role"
Germany stopped voting when deciding on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the U.S. and Europe, Stephen Szabo, Berlin balances on the narrow border of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany initially signaled at the beginning of the week that it would vote against the proposal for the Palestinian status observer in the United Nations.
Berlin then stopped voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it will support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from voting in terms of the establishment of a non-year-old zone.
Finally, NATO asked for it.
Is it difficult for Germany to focus on serious international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it is just changing its foreign policy, from the policy that was so-called the U.S., towards the German foreign policy.
It is more difficult for Europeans to have a coherent and coherent policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just living in their role, but they're on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or in the UK.
What is "normal" foreign policy in Germany?
It demonstrates the willingness to engage in national interests and attitudes that are independent of US positions or European partners.
I think German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Had economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and voting in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large residence in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, they must be careful not to scare the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
But I wouldn’t even like to ascribe too much meaning, it’s not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, it plays an important role in the German strikes.
Did Germany harm the relations with the United States when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, for example in voting on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding of the German attitude in Europe and even in the United States.
I don’t think it was as dramatic as in Libya.
I hope that Germany will have some respect.
This signals that it must be considered an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has clearly expressed itself for the veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. internal policy.
I think Obama's government is likely having a significant understanding of the European position.
But as a result of this political situation, this attitude cannot, of course, be kept public.
I think differences in opinions are actually not as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama isn’t really excited about Netanyahu’s policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to identify in accordance with its close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes the Germans difficult.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot, therefore, be part of a broader line and have to do things in advance from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Want to take the main role at all?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a larger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany plays a larger role, anti-German moods emerge.
That doesn't make it easier for the Germans.
This is an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by enemies.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for various neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The impact of the U.S. on European policy is now constantly declining, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment.
The Germans will just have to play a larger role.
Even though they don't like it, it's uncomfortable to them, and it's even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Protending brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What is Armani Polo?
This covers the labels that are fully officially registered in China, but have nothing to do with the original company.
However, it uses protection for as long as the real brand owners violate it.
And even then it’s not clear whether the laws can come home.
"For foreigners, it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of laws in the Far East.
Every week, a new case is on my writing table.
A few more letters are enough to sign up for the liars.
For example, from the Gucci brand, Lu-Gucci becomes, and instead of Prada, they want to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies are also legally copied, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens the order with the records of the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company left there to protect the brand Zegna DF Puma, a artificial name that also parasites at the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and breaching intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey business houses, in which there are almost exclusively fake sales.
However, Pattloch's cases are different. It is under the authority of its mandate that the Chinese companies have the right to fully officially use the labels that are already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", the associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
These are the names of women who are hunting rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any faults.
"It hurts the business, we have to ruin it," Pattloch says.
"The marker dissolves, the exclusive position disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and judicial costs of affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive evidence products.
According to CLSA market research company data, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing market, with a volume of €15 billion per year.
However, the deletion of suspicious records in the trademark register can be achieved hard and it costs something.
The driving can take up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells about cases in which the court refused the complaint, because the denounced name became a long term of "trade reality".
When the complainant has compassion, he still has to pay the plagiator because he has damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
Also known cases relate to graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost legal disputes with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took German pump manufacturer into a concrete mixture of Putzmeister.
Today, China can use an emblem that resembles the star of Mercedes.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used the blue logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was equated, Geely had to change the logo.
Lacoste’s fashion maker lost in China with counterfeiting from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any faults.
However, the CTMO official admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too little staff and space.
But last year, it is alleged that "the process of work has returned from the emergency to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75% more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still in the office.
Something against this is expensive.
As often in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million brand protection applications were submitted to CTMO, which is almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and it means that China is undertaking a list of new applications around the world.
This applies also to the number of valid brands - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were selected for fees.
Simply, this means that each login costs an average of 1280 Yuans or 160 euros.
The dispute against this is worth several times, as indicates the case of German family company Freudenberg.
The group has been fighting against the Chinese plagiator for over seven years.
However, the Germans have achieved the cancellation of its illegal production of simulated automobile parts.
However, the counterfeiting has secured Chinese rights to Freudenberg.
We would remind ourselves of this, because the names cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO official also rejected the Munich company’s opposition.
In other two instances, Freudenberg has been entitled to the right, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight until today.
You need to be careful.
The case is now discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler believes that this will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "driving is extremely costly and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company’s archive, they even had to view hundred years old records to submit evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, on the contrary, has unwillingly offered a "high six-seat amount in euro" to resolve the dispute.
“You see what this means for us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers from the Far East will also affect Europe.
And in case the imitators have unprotected brands there.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to sign up the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long been abandoned by the group, yet it has managed to revoke the registration.
“You have to be careful,” Wentzler says.
He also advises Pattloch’s attorneys to German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark laws, but foreigners should rather have “everything worthy of protection in any way, sign up in China,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg in the last story of its drama falls under the brand, then the counterpart will probably have to pay the license fees for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pressured from the market in a disputed segment.
World Day Against AIDS: Swimming, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is tested - and in Svazia, orphans are happy for parents who have died of AIDS.
A connection story that exceeds more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there are dumplings: cowboy high boots, basketball boots, ladies boats and men's mocasins are looking for a parking lot and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly, the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and sopran - are urgent, mothers and stripped each other.
Fiete Hopfa, a 29-year-old director, almost raises it from his textile shoes when he combines his voices with his wild gestures.
It's Monday evening. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbongi's congregation tests a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from the researcher of human genetics to the indigenous.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every assembled voice has a different text and in a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesothu, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swazijska.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of which 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Svazia, there are 245,000 orphans after parents who have died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40% of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found a collection of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them visit secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, a patronage can be taken.
It guarantees a child's school, school uniform and one warm meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in the Zulu language "reporter of stories" or also "who glorifys".
No one can speak in this room with a gas bustling, just sing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has been singing songs in this foreign soft speech and sometimes brings them back from where they originated: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, it is located in the northeast of the Swazian Kingdom of the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the power of the German congregation.
40 percent are infected
There are approximately 2,000 people living there, some still in simple aluminum or sliding shells. Most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have suffered from HIV.
In Esitjeni it is seen in a small, so the state of the whole of the United States: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of a male pre-cutaneous skin, which proves to be significantly reducing the risk of half infection, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in the United States carry a weakened immune virus in themselves. There is no rarety that they die in less than 30 years of age.
In the spring of 2005, however, Imbongi members saw many children in the streets missing not only parental care but also cleansing everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, they have no chance in the poor country at all.
Initially, it was a private placement of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed the child to go to school and give him a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, a community of Voices for Africa was founded, which has since taken care of orphans to parents who have died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and cappuccino (gonorea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papilomavires, herpes genitals or hepatitis.
Mums and swelling belong to the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the most disabled group?
Syphilis and cappuccino occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Kocha Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (plain), cappuccino and human papilomavires.
HIV is relatively little widespread among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected people belong to this group.
In adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections are related to young people aged between 15 and 25 years.
In addition, human papilomavires often occur among youths.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to the Robert Kocha Institute, the number of infected syphilis increased from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected people has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
It’s about a tenth less than a year ago.
What symptoms warn about sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulties in urination, exacerbation, abdominal pain, and pancreas or brass.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unobserved.
How can we protect ourselves?
The risks of infections can reduce condoms, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because the origins of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infections from impurity and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially in the case of frequent interchange of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPIs and avoid subsequent consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable gifts, and, in the end, to the honors that the congregation earns by singing throughout Germany, some money will be collected.
"We have sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni all over," said Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confidence woman who can manage.
It also takes care of the needy children to find grounds, for example in some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in zulu language, are the resistance of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and make sure that their children are delivered in uniforms every day at school in time.
Children who don’t have anyone anymore go to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by a spouse as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, Voices for Africa founded the school of shit, set up two chickens, and along with the U.S. health organization PSI ordered that many people in the village were allowed to test HIV.
Of course not. Even if the disease is so obvious throughout the world, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is absolutely a taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do sexuality.”
In fact, it is quite strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his infinite lifestyle.
Polygamia instead of democracy.
This state-approved lifestyle is also blameless because the HIV virus has so rapidly spread over the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the land.
Annette Lennartz says the condoms are free at every corner, but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
In order to support at least a bit of cultural exchange, the Imbongi congregation travels once every two or three years together across South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, struggle, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, many of whom in the southern part of the Black Continent know from the age of apartheid.
The bus full of white people singing songs in the Blacks - such award not only brings mood and joy, but also has already shaken tears with many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children with a patronage.
Although this village is hardly found on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is light,” people say.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometers away from here, to the smoking singers at the Bergheimer Straße test, you see that the light shine here too.
Messenger: NASA Discovered on Merkuru Ice
The Messenger sonda found evidence that there is a Merkur ice on the planet.
The ice cover can be thick up to 20 meters.
The U.S. National Office for Aviation and Spacecraft (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as it appears from three studies published by the professional journal "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger sonda has found evidence that there is an ice covering in the area of this planet that is in a permanent shade.
It is estimated to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even 20 meters strong.
This water came from the comet or perhaps from the asteroids that landed in Merkur.
But let’s recently find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet,” said Sean Solomon, leader of scientists working on the Messenger sonde.
The temperature on Merkuru can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, findings can help us explain how water and other basic elements of life have come into other areas of the solar system.
Sons, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved by the earth, participate in the exploration of the depths of the universe.
From time to time, pictures will be sent to Earth, a small window to infinite transmissions.

One of Hubble's largest and most sharp pictures: a believer galaxy
Pictures of spirale galaxies, according to their coloring, become real artworks.
The photograph, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows several thousand light-years away the Trifid flood in the Co-Star Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divisioned into three parts, three parts), as dark dust strips divide the heart of this star parent into three parts.
In Hadon's constellation, astronomers photographed the prelude of the space rain: within 400 million light-years from Earth, the nucleus of two flashing galaxies has to occur inevitablely.
This star's birth was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the spirale galaxy M83.

This image was made of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called the Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spirale galaxy is called by scientists UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way is located in this star flour.
A number of stars gives rise to new growths.
Also, this star cloud, associated with the Rosette flour, is still born new young stars. They are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe it occurred only shortly after the Great Treasures, when it was mainly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
In 1608 Hans Lipperhey was claimed to be a remote viewer and used him to observe the stars a year later before Galilee.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been increasing - and the views that are mediating are increasingly deeper.
The world's largest remote observation for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diega.
The mirror on this image had an average of five meters.
Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe with two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
However, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap design method: the telescope is secured by a height angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height corner.
Its particularity is the high reinforcement of light flow.
Despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, it is equal to the world’s largest mirror views.
Using the radio telescope in Arecib, Portugal, scientists are looking for alien signals in the universe.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.

Overview of the Observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chilean Andes.
It stands here Very Large Telescope - and honors its name.
This television with a total of four mirrors can also welcome the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned for ESO’s Chilean observatory.
Its main mirror is 42 meters full and consists of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keckov telescopes on the Hawaiian soup Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keckov telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which, besides them, looks into the universe through the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
The Mauna Kea is also supposed to create a new huge telescope - with a 30 metres diameter of a mirror.
Here you can admire it on the picture.
However, the most important impressions from the universe are mediated by Hubble’s space television.
The remote worlds have been recorded since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009, especially those who are inhabited.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The picture documents the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
James Webb’s Space Television (JWST) will be shot into the space in 2018 on board the Ariane 5.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Great Earthquake.
Scientists believe that the ice is also on the Southern Merkuru Pole.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger circles around this planet far closer to the northern pole.
Radar measurements have been demonstrated for decades that there is ice on Merkuru.
Thanks to the Messenger sonde, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to circulate around Merkur, scientists now have certainty.

Looking for tracks in a country where 97-year-olds are relatively young.
We can call the wild romantic.
The microbus runs along the road with many rotations along densely forged hills, delicate rivers and simple sea stations.
Everything is green and juicy, almost appears to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the southernmost Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
There is a Caucasus ethnic group of Talishs, of which it is not too well known, besides speaking Persian and Azerbaijan perfectly and having a very high age.
Finally, it's Lerik.
This city is honoured by the monumental architecture of the Soviet times, which does not fit into the picturesque mountainous landscape.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here. Arrival from Azerbaijan capital Baku is too easy.
It takes 8 hours to reach 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The magical wealth, for which countries are grateful for oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in rural areas.
Nevertheless, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that Lerik wants to become a tourist attraction.
"The Grandma celebrated the Grand Prix of Eurovision in May - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year," Fatulajeva said.
He is the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozens of Talyshs from the surrounding area who are over a hundred years old. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was still born.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the shepherd of Shirali Müslüm, who was allegedly 168 years old.
The family letter does not exist.
And since the eldest man with evidence was 122 years, Muslim's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulajeva.
He was claimed to have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136 he was still born a daughter.
Wasn't Shirali Muslim in his age for a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the ages of people in Central Asia.
"Of course, many high-age people live in some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "some very old men live in Sardinia as well."
However, no scientific evidence of age can be given because of the missing grounds, especially when the matrix is missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact, however, is that people around Leric experience the Bible’s age often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many people live in the south?
The Azerbaijan guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talish.
The director of the museum of Fatuljeva believes that it is in nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of the Talishs, who love meat, bread, and mostly milk products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, does not look just reliable.
Or is this the original way of life that keeps young people alive? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, the resident of Rubaba Mirzaev.
At the age of 97, this geographical width is relatively young.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He is sitting on the ground with a pearl that he is tired of.
There are eight people under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzai and the daughter of Mirzai. Both of them have long been grandparents.
Two small children are also struggling around.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical bottled glasses "armada".
The white teeth of Mirzajevy form the perfect series and under the hat hides a long dark blonde copy that proudly covers her son in front of us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzajeva says.
Monthly retirement for life is enough
She always ate just what came from her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven’t even bought food in a supermarket for my whole life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was World War II.
But everything improved when the feast took over the "beloved father" Gejdar Alijev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of old women.
However, the cult that turns around the characters of the fathers of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, does not know the boundaries of Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003 and then took his son Ilham's passport.
Old people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from emergency.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly retirement of 230 manats (around the same amount in euro). This is the amount of the amount from which you can enjoy well here.
And maybe the seven-year-old son of Mirzajevy is right: "The old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of big families, are loved, excited and happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The demonstrations in Cairo revealed the profound disintegration of the country.
We are discussing the future constitution based on the law of the Sharia.
The Egyptian president did not save pathogens.
We need to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible, in front of people and in front of God," he said.
His word was intended for the whole nation, especially for the Christian Copters, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secular persons.
All of those who are still unholy in the confused opposition, namely, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" on the Nile issued for the grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost excusefully said he had temporarily restricted the competence of the constitutional court and extended its own to "saving the revolution".
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has a doctorate degree at the University of Southern California really wants to save, Egyptians do not understand the world.
Should justice be freed from power?
234 paragraphs, which were rapidly approved by the Constitutional Assembly with the majority of Islamists in a fifteen-hour night marathon, partially raised concerns.
As in previous constitutions, it is said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the foundations of Islamic law".
But what does it mean to be "posts"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation and it can be feared that Islamists will use this unclear formulation and the associated legal free space for a rigorous interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this is reflected by the newly added paragraph: In all matters concerning Shari, it is necessary to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the country’s most important Islamic institution with a great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
This may not, but it may mean that the clergy will supervise the law, which would bring the jury to the fact of the removal of injustice.
There are a lot of interpretation in the constitutional proposal.
The problem is also that the civil powers of military courts must continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarakov's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11 000 civilians were in military jail.
As stated in the proposal, the State should also protect the right essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values.
This is so inexactly formulated by the legal side that by means of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature.
In an understanding speech, this means nothing but censorship.
Otherwise, no paragraph defines in writing the explicit equality of men and women.
The other paragraph therefore prohibits to hanob or speak of the Prophet Muhammad and his messenger.
But it remains unclear what is deceit and how it will be deceived.
It is also doubtful that the formulation that is forbidden is "assaulting people".
In this case, is the president's caricature or a joke on the account of law experts?
A matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursí will submit to signing and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of the people's vote.
"The revolution came back"
For a few weeks, an opposition against the overthrow of Islamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual meeting on Friday night at the Tahir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the Constitution before it began to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbáhi, who was placed in the presidential elections in third place.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, stated that the draft constitution belongs to "the ground of history".
Through the service of short reports, Twitter accused Mursi’s supporters of wanting to make a “fire against democracy”.
"When he announces a referendum, we'll go to his palace and cut it off," opposition member Jásir Said said.
“We’re not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not been punished yet,” said the Egyptian opposition policy media Chalid Aliho.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a rebellious demonstration, but with caution not on the Tahir Square, but on a crowd of prayers on the other side of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
Many of the women and the supporters of the salaffists took part in him, shouting, "This people requires the application of the law of God."
And they said to Murshi, "Let the earth be cleansed!" And they said, "The Qur'an is our statute."
The battle for supremacy over the symbolic square of Tahir, on which everything began, would probably provoke a similar civil war.
Mursi's supporters obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents and supporters of the constitution’s proposal were expressed with voice and clearness.
Now is the time for the people to decide in what direction the country is to go.
Most of them are considered to be in favour of the proposal of Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' does not exist once"
A forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, says Hafize Abu Sa'ad.
The eighty-four-year-old human rights defender and the Egyptian President of the Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or standing before the court.
Not because they share their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable for them.
He was killed, sentenced, and imprisoned.
"And now in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not once or once," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
The forced expansion of power to all three power components in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous crime against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the president's civil society, it actually cancels it," Sa'da complained.
Without civil society organizations, however, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned by an international community that follows the game of ideological fractions in the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be his fault.
The demonstrant on the Tahir Square warns: “You have created a monster that you can no longer control.”
The most fragrant fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of success of the land be associated with local appetite for an extraordinarily fragrant fish?
Take a few overwhelming cheese.
Place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty and wet soccer equipment.
Let it go a week.
So you get a paralyzing cheese of rakfisk, one of the largest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, beautiful view - and in the air there is a scent of everywhere.
Rakfisk is a salted pearl swallowed in the water for up to one year - depending on how much you want to fish.
As it smiles and begins to be cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes are starting to gather for a festival dedicated to the best, the most submarine meal.
"You dream raw and then you'll have a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional boss, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", which is responsible for the festival.
People around us eat small fish bottles and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that was on the long way by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of very different times when there was poverty in Norway, and since there was no freezer yet, fish were flooded into airy vessels with water and salt in the fall.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well dipped, they pulled out and ate - the feelings of alcohol were undoubtedly dipped.
Thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and search for work, mostly migrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted by large numbers of jobs, high wages and a wide system of care.
The residents of Sweden, an ancient rival, which was much richer than Norway recently, flow into the country for work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, intact, although a relatively enticing part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Even if it's expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich will get you for 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway is often missing in global reports - and most people seem to do so.
The name of Anderse Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, people are still talking about disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called a "July 22 event".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
The current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason why we are doing so well,” says Anna, our chicken, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, represents a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as the English of most people here, is totally inconvenient.
We don't show up, we don't like proof.
Norway is very careful to manage its oil wealth - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading to global financial crash scattered the money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had sneakers on their place tightly sealed.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and walk on tours in the summer, we are happy,” Anna says.
"And eating rack fish," he adds with a dirty laughter.
I'm standing in the snow front for something to eat - I've got enough rack fish.
Such a lucky burger is definitely something different and is beautifully juicy.
But the night's a buzzy fish here again.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the most demanding fish.
They have a connection with a live TV, in which a moderator with a motif is surrounded by a taller with a rakfisk.
It’s like a song competition for Eurovision.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"Here's our point, Havard."
It calls for a smile and a laugh.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps capable of aquavite.
Or maybe steam from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a heavy start
As the upcoming Mexican President Enrique Pen Nieto is preparing to take over the office, Will Grant from the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is swallowed even in the best times, steel blocks have been linked to closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, it was not the aim of preventing people from getting into work, but to prevent protesters from getting into parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pen Nieto, will receive the president's body and take over the nation's leadership.
He faces a challenging task.
In the time of Felipe Calderón’s departure, Mexico was well economically conducted, but the country is in a burning drug war, which is already estimated to have killed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to reducing violence against the Mexican people," President Pen Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval work at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before he wash his hand with the U.S. President, President Pen Niet gained political experience as governor of his home country of Mexico.
The views of a new leader are different in his old homeland, the people and the vast state surrounding the capital.
Direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember it in a good way.
Citizens are assigned to the development of tourism in the summer and the construction of infrastructure.
Now you can get to the city on one of the new roads that let Pen Nieto build. These roads are a huge improvement compared to the holes and backways that were there before.
The boards with its name also depend on the wall of the modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," said Friend and Political Allied Gabriel Olver Hernandez, a State Member for President Pen Niet, the institutionalized Revolution Party (PRI).
We are particularly hoping for interesting and real changes in the field of security and economy that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was released by Vicente Fox.
Mr Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the president's Los Pinos palace, Enriqua Pen Nieta is much expecting.
And he refuses to express the opposition that characterizes the new president as a person without substantial content.
It is a very direct man, very busy with an excellent view of the land.
He is a great citizen and mostly a person who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have from their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the devastated streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
It is trapped under highways in many places like the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also permanent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help overcome drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly inches of violence against women.
Only in the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been buried in empty places alongside huge waste treasures.
At the time of Pena Nieto being governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, Pen Niet’s critics say he failed to address the problem of women’s murders in his office.
And in the worst case, his leaders accuse him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical for the fragrant neighbourhood, Irinea Buendia shows me the pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses the cry.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I came to her house, it looked like someone washed her body," Mrs. Buendia recalls.
There were signs on him after the guards, and there was already a famine after death.
As her mother tells her story, Mariana looks down from the image on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is the only word: "Justity".
However, this is what the family says, exactly what they have been given.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old fool, a problem, and a knockout.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when so many mistakes and forgottens have happened," he says.
The shepherd that President Pen Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
During the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by a violent crime, and the new president promised that during his office action they would be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," said the PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
This is exactly what the families of victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about wrong treatment, the military prosecutor said.
The military prosecutor is trying to reject Bradley Manning's allegation on the brutal treatment of imprisonment.
Hearing focuses on Manning's stay in a military jail in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants the case to be rejected on the basis of harsh treatment with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the army of Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest escape of secret material in the U.S. history, has missed many possibilities to complain of harsh treatment that he is allegedly suffered in military imprisonment.
Attorney May. Ashden Fein at the cross-examination of Manning's military at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the records of weekly visits Manning had with officers of the unit during nine months of bonds in Quanticu, Virginia, show no complaints of misconduct.
A cross-examination that took place during a defence proposal to deny the case against Manning due to a brutal treatment at the time of a binding, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning proved that he had thought of suicide in the binding.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the Friday hearing, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, went through the form that the officers filled out after meeting Manning in a jail prison in Quantic, where he was held in a regime with increased care from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday for these forms, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards was considered "excellent" and the overall treatment in the facility was considered "very professional".
Formers have no complaints about wrong treatment, even though Manning officials have asked directly how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that the concerns about the various problems were expressed orally and that the officers who visited it spoke to him about these concerns and pointed out that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
“They wrote “no problems” (when they discussed concerns), and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t mention them,” Manning said.
Lieutenant Denise Lind also asked why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 during a meeting with a suicide committee, which he expressed in the form for several months earlier.
Manning responded that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injuries" regime.
The army stated that this restrictive regime (one degree under supervisory regime due to suicide) used him to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the inmates to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy an increased quality of life as I saw it here," Manning said.
Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was detained almost two months before he was transported to a sea jail in Quanticu, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once he was defeated there because of the heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what would happen to him in the surrounding world was very challenging.
"My world was frozen only on the base of Arifjan, on the crash," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cave.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica, he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small area without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, a cover, ankles, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because he was sleeping or just lying was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face, when he turned on the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint against Manning’s military in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for the charges he brought on Thursday on the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his Quantico cell naked, he was also forced to be naked in front of the guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning told him that when he counted, he was not allowed to hide his cover.
In the Friday hearing, Judge Manning said that from the order of his guards, he condemned that he had a cover that he could hide, but admitted that no one gave him the order to dismiss it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to prove to the officer that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning stated that he said he could use a tape from his lower washing machine or his necklaces to hurt him, but he didn't do it.
Manning told him that night his underwear, his necklaces and glasses were removed from his cell.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the case of his sentence before a military court, whose beginning is expected to begin next year, his punishment will be significantly reduced.
Defence said it plans to admit Manning is guilty of lower crimes and will fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend connection conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was kept in line with the rules on all arrested with maximum caution.
The allegations against Manning include the support of the enemy, the illegal cause of the publication of news documents on the Internet, the transfer of information on national security and theft of public assets or records.
If he is accused in all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are the lap between the two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely walked through the dave and arrived in the immigrant agenda where I hit the problem.
The lines indicated one of two fronts: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Citizens").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and I was called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy".
So later I ended with the label "Mexican American".
But that was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage both sides of the interview in this language.
However, I don't have a vocabulary of my parent speaker, and I can't get rid of the American attraction.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in front of "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment that newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pen Nieto visited the White House of President Obama this week.
The program has common issues that are taking place when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why there is the same probability that the Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cards, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of enemy feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leaders under the threat of weapons to overwrite half of the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for the Mexicans who think within centuries, not for minutes, the memories are everywhere present.
So, a minute after the U.S. representative just says something critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaints about how Americans intervene in the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And Montezumy's children will go on the war road.
However, for Mexico, there is a real challenge for more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about enemy feelings?
That's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and defeats, people the country offers opportunities, and others not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point of our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandfather who had a chance to go north in Mexico.
And more often than it appears, this person corresponds to the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even if we live an American dream now, we go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And yet we know that many of the elite Mexicans who belong to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and look at us as a subordinate race that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our journey to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, according to them, is only a failure.
If our families weren't living in Mexico, they would never leave her.
And now we wouldn't be imprisoned for a challenging gun, with a good life in the United States, but yet with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally travelled to the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more than they are, and Mexicans don't like it.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know do not feel as part of one.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteena.
You’ll get the best of both countries, but you don’t have roots in one.
He looks at us as Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of intelligence, as I learned, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and push on political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No, no.
So that's not going to happen.
Too many enemy feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of revenue and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are unsure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's on you, friends.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the United States of the way they treated Mexicans a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexicans still feel ambitious for the way they treated their family members in a substantially closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be the uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a permanent peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another cycle of bloodshed indicates that any such incident is lost.
Among the usual unnecessary agreements on who started it, many buildings were transformed into careless, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelites, and for the first time missiles from Gaza, near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to have embraced their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing everywhere around them.
The Arab spring has changed old orders and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are captured in the emerging chaos in the region.
Maybe it will make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this can interrupt their deadly path situation.
A war that doesn't win or win.
At first glance, there are no many reasons for optimism at the moment.
Even if the shutdown of the fires closed on 21 November, the fights from this week would be stronger on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, an Islamic movement that has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have forced Israeli people to depart, although Gaza has suffered a defeat.
Despite the murder of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most sad and humanised corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And in fact, Hamas has an influence on the West Coast, another piece of Palestine, which is currently governed by his defeated rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian fraction.
In addition, Hamas leaders can very well condemn that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, re-resurrected regional power, which once was the closest Muslim allies of Israel, added to the side of Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The writers of Hamas say that the Islamic half-moon is surrounded by Israel, north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party/military ruled, across Syria, where rebels who are increasingly cloned with Islam can settle Bashar Assad until after Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood has changed under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the far-reaching and hardest Arab country, the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despote that ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is Hamas' cousin, and his leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as a player that cannot be excluded either by Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israeli supporters of the hard line will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was restored to the bed.
Israeli missile anti-Iron Cobbles has proved its price and many missiles of Hamas have been destroyed.
Israeli people can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unprecedented as always. Many European countries also blame Hamas for the launch of the last wheel of violence.
And above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the president of the government, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza missiles have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, it has been quite quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, part of the wall that attacks the West Coast, the main part of what may be the Palestinian State once, and protects Jewish settlements that are still expanding through international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined even a more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the beginning of the campaign on January 22.
Why do we deceive the traitors of Palestine by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, would they not fire missiles as their landlords did in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind the wall, and we'll beat them when they get out of their heads.
Prosecutors may win hard lines, but the Arab Spring can change their preferences.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have too much love for Israel, their main priority will be addressing domestic problems.
Israeli defence expenditure is higher than the expenditure of all its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a new war with local superpowers will hardly help new Arab governments to heal their economy.
The fact that President Mursi worked with President Barack Obama in order to stop the fire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
Israeli people should also look at this situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, the defeat of the Palestinians' rights to self-determination courts with a fire dust that one day must explode in areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
At present, the repressions are weakening in the Jewish state of democracy and demographics are increasingly worse as the Arab population is growing.
Blood strikes against Gaza that take place every few years with a view to suppressing Hamas will make more and more diplomatic taxes.
Both sides need incentives outside.
The answer is what reasonable people declare on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: two countries where Israel will enter the territory for security.
In the short-term view, there is a little hope that stoping the fire will give pressures from the outside at least a little greater influence on the procession of this matter.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, has a better position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arab outsides must also press on the agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would be more than a direct offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations for the establishment of the Palestinian State.
President Obama also has his role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first election period, he ignored the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it appears to be equally delicate in his entry into the process.
It's sadly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful comparison between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia enters into force laws on smoking cigarettes
On invisible green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are displayed warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on smoking tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, have replaced the logo and colors of the brands with the general olive green boxes, with a widespread image of the sick parts of the body and showing children and newborns sickly resulting in the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, it is mandatory from Saturday the only difference between the brand name boxes that are printed with the same small letter.
This is the most urgent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to remove young people from smoking by getting rid of this abuse of its attractiveness.
It is based on studies that show that if people don’t start smoking up to the age of 26, there is 99% of the chance that they will never start smoking.
"And in very small children, you can see that they understand a message that tobacco companies try to sell to them with their product," says Tanya Plibersek, the Federal Ministry of Health, citing studies that, for example, have shown that children are linking a crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries consider introducing similar steps.
Tobacco industry has lobbyed against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and affordable cigarettes.
“Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintentional consequences,” says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging from silicone used to cover non-taste boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals regarding the laws of the Australian Supreme Court.
Ha said Zico had sold nearly 6,000 pieces to wholesale sellers and expected new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
As a possible strike, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
Throughout a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from direct views, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re a marketing professional in the tobacco industry and you just have this small space to promote your products, online space is an inexpensive place to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman has seen an increase in the ratings of social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "median Honzo".
We need to ask ourselves, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has done the job and created this video, or is it a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry focused on how to invest with new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far that it has paid to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia trade significantly.
The resolution of the SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek said the government had conducted interviews with other governments that consider similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The stricter laws are considered by Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of smokers in Australia are smoking.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You pull a cigarette and you pull a box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of a tumor in the mouth.
Honestly, there's just one reason to stop smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack traffic in the center of Sydney, claims that thanks to the united boxes, it is harder for him to deal with the regals.
"I took the charge for an hour, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should simply ban them completely, then we would say to one another, 'OK, it's the end, we'll close the cream'," he said, and he decided with his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it’s not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving Day I spent five hours in an unexpected way at the airport when our aircraft had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about boring.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite spreading books, magazines and iPhones (not talking about duty-free stores).
But some scientists and children’s development experts are increasingly coming with the glory of boringness.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to bore sometimes.
It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen today, we don’t have a chance to enjoy boring.
So should we support boringness?
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
But I'm going back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that took place with the coming of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of nude) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, he has a long history of boringness," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription on nudity originating from the first century BC.
And then the question is how we define nude.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University of Ontari, Canada.
After considering research literature and introducing ideas to the target group, about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined nude as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it."
The boringness of apathy differs from the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there is no need to do anything in apathy.
She says the nudity core is "a disruption of the process of attention associated with the bad mood and the feeling of slow--current time."
A lot of nudity can resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have mutual relationships, boring people tend to see a problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we only have trouble focusing.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out a previous experiment in which participants listened to the band on which a person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and non-associated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV show quietly reported more annoying than the other two groups - they had difficulties with focusing, but they were not sure why and assigned these problems annoying.
When you try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, an attention disturbance can lead to annoying, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontari, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "as the search for bad components on the factory line, spreading music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that scratching and scratching, often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically more careful.
“A study shows that children who are allowed to scratch will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace,” Professor Fenske said.
We've all experienced boring sometimes - the delay of my flight, a heavy-duty speaker, especially a long film.
But some individuals have more chances of boring than others.
To help measure nudity in the 1980s, scientists developed "Boredom Proneness Scales for Nudity" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The degree includes questions such as: "A lot of things I have to do is repeat and is monotonic," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these stages, scientists found that boys tend to bore more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, said, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally unfair.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and in doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if the percentage of bored expression would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that "aging is a top time for boredom", which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and youth are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is it boring for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, gambling or abusing habits as a way to relieve them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between nudity and creativity, Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Boringness is a way of telling you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a NYP psychologist.
But the brain doesn’t always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will make you happy for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is boring and you give him an iPad, he will no longer be boring, but he will not learn how to entertain yourself or manage yourself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate management is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child learns not only how to entertain yourself, but also gets greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate nude.
But we should not even be too critical to her.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are from the reach of continuous distraction of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of having more boring, but boring is painful, uncomfortable desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people actually are looking for is a way to relax and enjoy their leisure time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overturned," he said, "it is difficult to find ways to entertain when the noise turns off."
There are no guidelines on the new marijuana law in Colorado
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a higher professional school and a footballer from Southeast Colorado, faces charges of crimes for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and smoke that he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one day of February he went with several friends in Lamar, on plans near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the policeman found a marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued an appeal for drug holding and drug use equipment - small crimes in which each is charged with $100 - and the date of the court was set.
"They looked like criminals to us," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends rather than on site than on law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana detention offences have already been cancelled here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department stopped blaming adults at the age of 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in the more conservative Colorado districts said they would continue with existing marijuana cases and still accuse people of detention.
At the same time, several cities from Denver's suburbs towards the western mountains vote on preventing the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This issue is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going on next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief at Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads of the woods and regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set a license system for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all up to 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or in bad, is primarily in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now even for recreation.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, spokeswoman for the Washington State’s alcohol sales licenses.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggesting what could work.
“There is no real precedent under which we could control,” he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, enters into effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will still be no State License System, but legal holding is.
And there are complicated mechanical issues that must be solved over this period, for example how to balance the State Directive on the "relevant access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on the trade of cannabis up to 330 meters from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
“No one will be harder to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in Seattlu’s metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman of the Center for Legal Cannabis, recently founded research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates from the city of Aurora sent an email to his officials, noting that the city prosecutor will no longer injure for holding a small amount of marijuana in every 21-year-old and that the police will stop "with immediate validity" accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would promote urban laws governing medical marijuana farmers and continue to strike drug dealers and dealers.
In the Weld district in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a more strict view.
After voting, he stated that his office will continue to investigate cases of marijuana holding, mostly as a way to press the user to search for treatment.
Currently, 56 grams or less marijuana are accused of having 119 people, although many of them are accused of further charges.
"Our office is obliged to defeat criminal crimes that were crimes at the time of their occurrence," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer accuse adults of holding a small amount.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all ongoing cases of detention.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time by continuing to promote the right until it changes,” he said.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And anti-governmental reactions across the state revealed, in view of this large state green experiment, a profound disintegration between local officials.
For district prosecutors it is a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, Denver’s lawyer, who represents the accused of holding marijuana, and the local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"They spent so much of their lives chasing people that they still can't really accept it's legal," he said.
As the first countries to build a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national test cases for legalization of drugs.
Defence and government authorities plan new borders for legalized sales, while at the same time they are also anxiously awaiting directions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization of marijuana defenders hope that the Ministry of Justice will be supported.
Despite several arrests of marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients taking it that attracted attention, the federal government mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states operating.
While anti-drug agents are likely not going to push out the door to catch a small drug bag, they are likely to refuse to allow state-regulated trades with recreational marijuana allowed by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former anti-drug policy advisor for Obama’s administration.
Several Colorado cities do not expect the federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments have approved moratorium for any new marijuana stores, even if it will take about a year before any store can open.
Last week the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation where we'll give someone a license and then we'll have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this addition.
We look at what the municipality voted for, compared to what the state voted.
There are really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
Only today’s university students are attacked by their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother studied at the university I thought it was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern greedy Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, in two weeks after I went to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my bags, and turned back to my first scandal of life.
My father collapsed and wept.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard said I gave up because I had objections to the love of students in the extra room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said that I was gone because I was forced to drink from the hairy pigs.
The truth was less comic.
I've fled.
Yes, I ran away because I was subject to systematic shaking and scaring.
Not because of my somewhat strange name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this group of alleged lighting it was both bigot and barbaric: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was highly constructed by Margaret Thatcher's adviser and I the supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm taking it out so far.
Just because the latest reports indicate that the new generation of students right from midnight suffers from similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hate for conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students had the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative Members of the Younger Years Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College argue that due to their political views, they are “freely actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and given to them that they are not welcome.”
They call for a position in the university committee for equal opportunities to ensure that their opinions are free to communicate.
Their situation has not even helped the recent BBC Two documentary show Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about a student political event that conservatives counted as strangers and neo-Nazis.
In the series, the former President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) was introduced by the graduate Joe Cooke, who was riding Rolls-Royce, dressed in silver clothes and had a roll with a silver head.
At other high schools, conservative students say that they were treated as "official sheep" because of the introduction of high school.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of Nottingham University Conservative Association, said in a Sunday newspaper that "Left influence on universities is growing.
“People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all.”
A 19-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind a movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unpleasant," while the nineteen-year-old OUCA elected president Stephanie Cherill says that access to JCR members has been deteriorated from mid-right.
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion as well as to the good health conditions of the members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
In September 1986, I was 18-year-old and in a shameful way.
Hate against the Conservative Party was the most correct.
A year earlier, the university refused to grant an honorary degree to former Margaret Thatcher's student due to the funding of the high school.
Atmospherics are also worried.
During the first few days of the start week, when new students meet with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the pencil that was supposed to come.
I found that not only teachers quietly approve the dedication of conservative students, but also tastefully participate in them.
The policy of the mountain range, privatization and resistance of the government to sanctions against apartheid in the South African republic was introduced to the woods covered by listeners.
My first lecture was about translating the 18th-century French text into English and I wasn’t ready for what followed.
"Mrs Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please pass the first paragraph."
I've got a lot of trouble.
Professor Pitt, a little man with his face like a cake, was very yellow.
"Thhatchers refuse to teach French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students moved away.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic lessons in French in your free time, so if you are not too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt said.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt a light stick on my shoulder.
He was a second year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said boldly.
Unfortunately, that's the case.
Anyone who is suspicious of conservation is a liar.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most conservatives say they are labourists.
Later, at the local hospital, I tried to get rid of it.
I continued to disagree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick proved to be unsuccessful.
Student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (which irony) went to Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students have noted with him.
I was reversed, dirty.
"How do the conservatives love?" one asked.
They're fucking each other, aren't they?
I felt like they had to feel homosexual before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to join people who think like that only after the end of the day?
Should I turn into a labourist and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years ago, I developed as a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived at my faculty.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy advisor and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He was almost there.
He hated this place for his provinciality and humility and for his example to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he served as a professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to travel from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, looking for a place to stay with my unexpected metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
All political opinions were adopted during his studies in Oxford in the forty years.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of a dream mood.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His dirty eyes laughed.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a jerk.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exaggerated by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience has worsened.
My friend, also the supporter of the Conservative Party, underwent pressure and resigned from his conviction.
The next week in the course of the lesson, when another professor of history proclaimed in absolute seriousness that I was "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was red inside with cold, I admitted that my "parents had broken my brain" and I called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-term.
My father closed my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week to the newspapers of Murdoch.
My doors were locked.
I cried in and my persecutors gave it up after five minutes.
When they left, I packed my bag and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a deadly weakness.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and toughness in the educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers rose, but also hides behind the unworthy reputation of places with equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance rather than glory"
At the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which began this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentin Garavani’s exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the start of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unchangeable Italian adventure.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which lasts until 3 March, overcomes private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important celebrities, from Princess Salimy Aga Chan through the Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as a troop of his social rise: from a simple crossroads from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to an international "bohemian" idol.
Love the royal family is nothing wrong.
"They at least don't surprise you to sweat a cigarette to a great cover, as some wonderful pop-music celebrities do," baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz said.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy a lot and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains Thyssen's ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always had elegance rather than fame.
And it is a star from him."
Valeria Mazzo presents Valentina
The designer’s charism is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazzo.
“It’s been a long time we’ve been to him for dinner after one visit to Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were twenty, and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he saw and felt his spirit.
Thanks to him, all the invitations could feel important and loving," he recalls the top model who started working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"It will never get out of fashion because its designs are artistic works," he concludes.
Overview of birth
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsession, but a truly repeated love.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was built on a 70-meter-long passport that offers a role exchange: the visitor turns into a model and walks passports to observe the "obedience" of the dreams that Valentin's masterpiece has on herself, or the coat of the coat, which he picked Jackie Kennedy's coat, and the coat of his coat, on the coat of the coat.
In the public, there are names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norwegian, Rosario Bulgarian and Sophie Habsburská.
Naty Abascal and Designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget him."
"I don't remember it perfectly.
They were shirts, shirts, veste "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-hiver collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designers.
"I prefer him to others for his feminineness and great love for women because it emphasizes our beauty," said the former Duchess of Ferii.
"I like the colors that it uses, brighten a lot and give a "scroy" face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Neither the princess nor the fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how she dressed Valentina for the first time.
When she was teenager and lived in Italy, she wanted to be full-time and have the opportunity to dress one of her evening dresses.
It finally reached the end of the 90s.
“I bought my first dress from Valentina to celebrate the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
They were red dresses that had dresses with vocals, adorned lifestyles, and frames without frames.
It was a dream that became a reality,” said Rodrigo d'Arenberg’s widow.
"Valentino is lax for fashion, his passion is perpetual," explains an Italian aristocratic whose lives take place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a designer's festive dress stored "very careful... because dresses are not just dresses, it is also a set of memories they have in itself."
"King" fashion
The golden grain of the exhibition at Somerset House are the wedding dresses Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul in Greece in 1995.
To create these sleeve dresses of elephant colors with all of the pearls, twelve types of different landscapes and a four-and-a-half meter length was required for four months of work and 25 "hole" (as the designer calls his wedding).
According to journalists Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of specialized press, these dresses represent the top fashion range at the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from a high-speed company".
Valentino's elitary "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce, Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and awarded by the Honest League, collect as much honor as any of the husbands of his clients.
"My attention has always attracted his selection, calm, adjusted and perfect appearance," Princess d'Arenberg acknowledges.
“The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with county Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was uncomfortable, the time left no trace of him."
When the princess says...
World's hardest work: Syrian bearers in the area of Kawah Ijen
For four euro, wearers in the Indonesian soup area are playing with their lives and health when carrying 70 pounds of silk down the rough stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 hills who earn their living living by obtaining Syria from the Kawah Ijen soup on the eastern Indonesian island of Jáva.
This means that every day it has to crash up to the bottom of the crater, where the syringe gases are avoided from the inside of the Earth, and when contact with the air, it passes into a fixed state.
After cutting large blocks of syringe, weighing up to 70 pounds together, they wear them on their shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the stretched stone paths.
To the top of the soup, which stretches 2,386 meters, it’s only 250 meters, but for exhausted carriers it takes more than 40 minutes before they rise up with a speed of rise, because they maintain a balance and consider their steps so that they don’t climb and fall down.
They know that any crash could have been a life as it happened to a French tourist who crashed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen tops make five cents for each pounds of syrup that weighs
When they are upstairs, they stretch the way around tourists who photograph them as if they were oaks in the circle, and they wear tiredly heavy baskets to the weight that the company placed somewhat lower, at an overseas height of 1850 meters.
It is the PT Candi Ngrimbi company, which has been enjoyed in the stock since 1960 and has never paid to its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupee (five cents) per pounds of syringe.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because it has its place in everyday life and is used to produce fireworks, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamics, and even to whiten sugar.
"Because we usually wear 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupee (3.8 euros) for each road," Anto explains, who usually runs three roads a day.
One way takes three hours and it is destroyed at the end, but it can earn 138,000 rupee (11,5 euros) per day.
Although it appears to be a negligible amount of such inhuman effort, it is a triple of what he would earn on the field.
"The day wage of the hills is very high here. For example, for the collection of coffee is paid for 15,000 rupee (1.2 euros) per day and for 14 days the salary is two million rupee (167 euros),," explains a carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a cowboy.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupee (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the soap, for a serious reason in Indonesia that is as convincing as the breast: "I married a young girl from Bali to convert a girl I is Hindu to."
Anto has asthma, he feels badly breathing, still has coughs, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks her life three times a day in Kawah Ijen, whose gravenness has already begun to pay its taxes, although her face is protected by special masks and glasses.
I have asthma, I have a bad breath, I still have a cough, and I have eyes irritated with toxic gases that escape from the soup.
That's the price you have to pay for to achieve your dream.
“I’ll work for two years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” he promises.
This friendly and intelligent young man reached by the fate could be a tourist guide, a cleaner or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead do the work of the carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden chatter with other carriers and rises every day at two hours in the morning, because the cheese stops screwing at night and its characteristic yellow color changes into blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding dark, Anto goes into a crater and illuminates the path with a small light that she has attached to the helmet and bought it for her own money.
About 400 carriers carry on their shoulder basket with cheese from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high income, the copper mining has not mechanized due to cost savings, nor provides any equipment to the carriers working on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of 30,000 rupee (2.5 euros) for a photography fee, which together with a ticket for 15,000 rupee (1,2 euros) are chosen by natural park guards from tourists who come to photograph the soup and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, not for people," Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 pounds and ensures that he can endure working as long as it goes because he needs money to educate his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life.
Although the cheese burns the throat and throat in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and blows the tops in the dense vapors that come out of the soap, the tops are so claimed that none of them complains that they are suffering from serious diseases... but it is obvious to their shoulders, pain or respiratory disorders.
A unit that balances its back basket can only charge 50 pounds at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues take 15 tons of syrup, which then bring three trucks to the store in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the soup has been my whole life," Unainik says, and opens a widespread mouth that lacks several teeth.
The eldest of his five sons, thirty-year-old, he also earns the silver.
Time goes away, but the ongoing poverty of one of the world’s hardest tribes continues from generation to generation – tribes performing human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans understand that they don’t have children, career, stress and cost of living and education.
"Singapore's residence needs growth."
I'm married, and I'm a landlord, you're my wife, and you're a landlord.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of an ad on mental potatoes, but yet - or perhaps just because - the video in Singapore was massively expanded on YouTube at the beginning of this year.
These sentences are part of the rap that uses local touches of the type "we give a bush into the oven" as a smile on the degree of birth in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency that created the video hopes that this advertisement will be able to warn them about the problem in a funny way.
Douglas Hamilton, Art Director of the Agency, said he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfil their "citizen duty."
“It’s only about the Internet, so it had to be fun and fun.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that it was the subject we had to touch.
We knew that the government has tried a lot of things like expanding perfumes with feromony or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas could be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, "Why not do the most creative thing possible, such as the composition of a rap, to solve this problem?"
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take too much to light weight is the Singaporean government.
They spend $1,300 annually on encouragement of citizens to have more children.
The government’s marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its representative conservatism and strict social controls.
The rate of birth in Singapore in terms of population classification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
It last exceeded the birth rate of value 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the Marriage and Family Committee of the National Office for Population, says that it is due to "better education" and "a broader range of career opportunities."
"People have a broader range of options as regards life goals and priorities, it is not just a marriage and a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of free people and to the delay of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in the rate of birth in Singapore.
While in immigration policy, there were efforts to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against the decline of the population, this led to uncertainty among locals.
On some Singapore websites, there is uncovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
An increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government has recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, the attempt to address the problem arose using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rate has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenue, health expenditure and immigration policy, Singapore has also had certain unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small homes.
For example, it began to affect real estate trade.
The City Development Office began regulating the number of small apartments known as "bot-crabs", which can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in the shop.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support the youth lifestyle and reflect developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, the CEO of EL Developers, claims that their "boot crabs" are selling much faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular, so they’re sold for days or weeks faster than homes with a larger scale.
That’s why the cash flow is much better for us.”
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small homes in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the nation’s birth rate, a conversation with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city center indicates that they will not have a great effect.
"People are still in stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people are delaying it," a young official says.
“Let the rest have children.
But it’s important for me to rely on my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old boy.
Men and women mention career, stress, and cost of living and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
So whatever the government tries to force citizens to have children, they are Singaporeans who ultimately have the last word about establishing the family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal nature or "the area of private life that everyone has the right to protect himself from any disruption."
What is privacy for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to our daily lives and social media?
Does it understand the dangers it is exposed to when it reveals issues on the Internet that would certainly not tell anyone during normal communication?
Reporters from elPeriódico told five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are common users of the Internet.
In four cases, the concept of privacy was considered "something completely own" on the personal level and "username and password" as regards the social network.
“I wouldn’t disclose my biggest secret,” said Jorge in a decade trying to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world,” he says.
"I'm going to give you some nice pictures or pictures of how you play.
I'm talking to friends there too.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wouldn’t be mine, or a photo that would make someone joke,” she says.
This guy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of crimes, or to write humiliating or rough comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine fans on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
There is also a mother who has a name and password of one of the accounts.
“I created an account on Twitter so that I could express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if someone will answer me, I just give them there,” he added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
He said he would never receive a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone would recommend someone unknown to him.
The case of a 14-year-old Joseph is different.
This teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the last said network admits that he doesn’t know 20 people from his list of friends.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something to do, for example, with music,” he says.
According to this boy, no one of them called him on anything, nor wanted his address or phone number.
"If they were prompted or asked for it from me, I would simply remove them from their account," she admits.
José joined Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
That boys are not foreign experience with what is called cyberbullying today.
“The friends of the social networks were scattered.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was," he confirmed.
According to Joseph, the victim did not appear from the account.
"You've just activated a private regime."
Then explains a series of steps how to securely set your account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish pictures of known in unpleasant or stubborn situations.
“Of course, I would do it if someone was wrong with me or would just like me.
Although I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order to correctly orient children and adolescents on social networks, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
He stated: “The Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks emerged, the rules of the game changed.”
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic employee Marc Prensky, graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Homestay and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
“We are digital immigrants who need to teach them, while we are only learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, in the age when it is not yet mature."
Also, to be - as regards the surroundings - reasonable, at the time when the most he wants is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porras also calls out some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like to have someone published your photo as you published a friend?
Do you know what others are telling about you?
When you mark people on holiday pictures, did you ask for permission for those people?
And one more: Do everyone need to know what you’re doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave in an internet environment as well as outside it.
These are the same rules.
“A person outside the Internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles, and that should be the same on social networks,” he said.
Dohled
Studo Guardia, a university professor, first-class teacher and educational advisor explains that it is necessary for parents to read the rules of social networks carefully.
“If they understand every kind of jealousy, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that the creation of an internet account can have.
For example, when it comes to age or what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
Guardia believes that it is essential to remind children of the traditional rule "not to talk to foreigners".
The Summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without a declaration from Lima, which was notified and allegedly signed by seven present presidents.
The Ef has repeatedly attempted access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidential office, who initially stated that the document would be published after the summit, stated that it would be later published on the Peruvian government's website.
They also stated that the content was published in a few short press releases by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humalou.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the negotiations, a video from the presidential meeting without a sound was transmitted in the press room with a message "confidencial session, audio transmission was blocked".
A small amount of information that journalists had available was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present but not by the Persian speakers.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participants with the presidents, which created nevole hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail with a "confidence declaration" from the summit, but it was only the statement of President Humaly, not the official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA) and there was no initially promised declaration from Lima, although the press was urgently required.
On the official website of ASPA, the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities have strived to ensure a broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent the accession of information.
The summit concluded, among other things, with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court, which addresses disputes on the border between the two countries.
President Ollant Humala and Chile President Sebastián Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decisions of the International Court of Justice in Hague, which will begin Monday by hearing the defence speech of both sides to discuss disputes initiated by Lima against Santiagu.
"We'll resolve and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute we're discussing today in this international court," President Humala said along with his Chilean opponent.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, peacekeeping disputes, conventions and international courts," said Piñera, congratulating President Humal at the flag of both countries.
The affirmation of both presidents that the decision of the International Court of Justice was subjected to, was published after Colombia adopted the Bogot Pact this week, expressing submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which decided on the borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered that this decision was entirely misleading.
The summit was held without the participation of Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay was excluded from Unasur in 2011 following the appeal of former President Fernanda Luga and did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was entrusted with the opening of morning talks and the completion of the summit in Lima shortly after the afternoon.
The President read the final document in which he informed the adoption of 16 agreements and planned activities for 31 projects among South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreed agreements, UNASUR Member States will take "important steps towards the target of South American citizenship, which extends the stay agreements."
He said they were supported by actions to improve "co-operation in combating civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve the availability of drugs and cheap internet in all corners of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, “it does not have economic consolidation (Latin America) to be a victorious essence, but to serve to expand our productivity and to show our nations a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connection of different locations of South America, particularly in rural and border areas... to make our countries better linked and create new economic links," the President of Peru said in a statement.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and its root axis from the coast to Brazil, and two others concern a better connection with Ecuador, but he did not give more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the Union of South American nations," which is currently excluded.
Another issue he highlighted was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is complete and has good neighboring relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before attending a regional meeting, said he hoped that he would meet his opponent Daniel Ortego in Mexico on Saturday to negotiate with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice on a dispute on the sea border, which is questioned by God.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortego tomorrow on Saturday," Santos said.
"We are negotiating all solutions, no one is excluded, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortego to conduct the negotiations in the most civilizated and incomplete form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have to participate in the inauguration of that president, Enrique Peñi Niety.
As part of the summit, EU Defence Ministers have preliminary meetings to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the area.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary president of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, really must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union (Unasur) in Lima, state TV Peru stated that Europeans “killing themselves during World War II” and in other conflicts, “but now there are almost one power.”
In this sense, the project for the creation of South American citizenship, which is supported by the Member States of Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and employees within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andic Community, however, there are still back-to-back areas that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian President expressed his consent to the rebuild of the U.S. State Organization (OAS) provided that the influence of the Anglo-States will be reduced and will be taken into account those who signed the San José Human Rights Pact.
“Those who are in front of us are never bound by anything, and we, South Americans, are signing everything.
It is uncomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is financed by the United States in Washington," the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange said in a statement on the political asylum issued by Ecuador.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that “there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process.”
In addition, he criticized the Swedish lawyer who asked him to submit an interrogation on the territory of Sweden due to the alleged sexual crime, while "the Swedish legislation allows for an interrogation by a video conference call that could be carried out from the Ecuadorian Embassy in the Embassy".
Correa said there was a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health in Assange.
"I haven't talked to him since the time in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had small lung problems, but nothing serious," the head of state said.
“But it is risky that his physical and mental condition is worse because it is closed in a small space without the possibility of moving in fresh air.
That would be the health of everyone," he added.
President Correa noted that the asylum solution provided to Assange on the Ecuadorian Embassy in London from June on the basis of a permission to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that the conquest with London was conducted by the Wikipeaceans.
“We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but conversations were constantly held.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, as Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
He said, “If the UK releases a break tomorrow, it will end.”
And if Sweden listens to Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as there is no problem law and as it has already been implemented in other cases, this problem will be ended tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he certainly does not tolerate "submediacy, bad intentions, and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
“The greatest enemy of the free press are not we, the politicians, but the poor journalists in the services of profits, pressures and pressing,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his excitement for the fact that neither bankers nor hegemon countries nor bourgeoisies have ruled Ecuador, and said that if re-elected, "it will continue to change in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa further supported the decision to maintain the veto expressed in Paraguay on membership in the Union of Unasur at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and intolerant of opportunism and puchism entangled in legality" because in fact "devastated the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy".
In addition, Ecuador’s president said he considered “a fully appropriate” the desire for his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the judgment of the International Court of Hague, which decided for the benefit of Nicaragua.
Currently, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will to walk together must be overcome.
It is necessary to evaluate the scale to be overcome and to have the opportunity to go ahead.”
He also expressed hope in resolving a maritime dispute that addresses the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries are willing to take a judgment, no matter what hard it is."
In connection with the possibility that he will be candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to reach the third mandate already, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa stated that if the elections were lost in February 2013, she would leave the public life.
“I personally never cared about the power, but so unfair situations such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must take this responsibility,” he said.
“If I win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it's the same for me.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hug Chávez in Cuba.
“I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Madure, who said that President Chávez went for planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign was completed.
This is not a relapse in the state of the president's health," he explained.
The head of Ecuador has participated today at the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Governments of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which has been ended with the challenges of increasing regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 when his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a flash hit me," he tells in memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "relief a little," but apparently without success.
The boy hid it in front of the family.
He decided to take his sickness on his own bed, and began to inform her, with such a pledge that he celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is certainly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several fights against the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unrepresentable in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and greater stigma.
At that time, neither the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security Clinical (IMSS) decided he was "because he had a cutting wound."
At that time, AIDS was a synonym for death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to survive fully.
However, there are many people who don’t know about their diseases and come until the virus causes the destruction of the body and extends the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since the world's AIDS disease, or at least from the first documented cases, "meaning great success that the length of a patient's life, which in time and appropriately begins treatment, is completely the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV entities at the Civil Hospital of the year.
HIV/AIDS doctor Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with 500 diseases, with people who don’t take drugs for up to 30 years, with people with up to 200 cells.
Simply speaking, it means that a person who has been diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age may, according to these knowledge, "when he observes treatment, live without problems up to 75 years of age," the doctor explained in a interview.
To emphasise this progress, it is appropriate to remember that the average lifespan of the Mexicans is 76 years now.
Although death has decreased significantly in recent years, and in Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Joint Programme), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
Only 255 people died in the state of Jalisco in 2011 and 187 to this year, but since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviratics has been guaranteed.
Why do people still die from the consequences of the disease?
“I think the problem is not in the possibility of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it's happening in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't exhausted the stocks of drugs. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of infection or late stage of the disease."
“Nine out of ten patients come when some associated infections are already occurring. The only thing we need to do to more impact overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to provide largely tests for the diagnosis of the disease to all those who ask for it.”
In his proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco also directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to let tests in a private laboratory just because he did it by his friend, and despite his low age at him already broke out AIDS disease, and also suffered from a complicated Kaposi disease.
“Everything will change when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather be drunk three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was to be better, healthy, exercise, take medication."
To date, his parents only know that he has suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, have lots of activities, I travel, I live an active sexual life, but responsiblely, I care about myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge of sharing his experience with MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate his witnesses on World AIDS Day today.
"Let them do the tests. If they risked, then let them know if they are HIV positive as soon as possible, it is better. And if they have already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they are responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the fight against AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the pult
Among health programs and ordinary citizens there is a big loss, says Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist, who finds information about the HIV virus.
And the greatest of them are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, one or two have been given to us before, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who have no access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"What do you want to do?" is a common question full of irony and evaluation from social workers, school advisors, pharmacy staff and medical staff that teenagers want to avoid, says a reporter.
He proposed this ineffective distribution to change, not only for the condoms behind the tables, but for hundreds of them to be located in public toilets, in places where young people frequently go.
"It is not the support of promiscuity.
It is not about "paying beer and motel" to them, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree with the distribution of containers in his district.
The best thing is to make condoms available to those who already have sexual life,” he said.
Key numbers in Jalisco
13,435 cases were reported (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This condition is the fourth place in Mexico in new and found cases of AIDS and the 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% of blood y 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, because in one registered case there are four to five people who don’t know about the disease.
A decision approved by the United States appeal court, which does not recognize the restructuring of Grupo Vitro debt established by the bankruptcy in Mexico, constitutes a nearby precedent for any national subsidiary in the neighbouring country and the issue of solvency.
Therefore, the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws appear to not apply in the country of strings and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hal at the Northern Texas Conflict Court leaves Mexican companies in practice without defence against the possibility of confiscation of their assets on the other side of the river el Bravo.
The judgment, however, opens the door to the Supreme Court of the United States to the chief Mexican manufacturer with a appeal against three irregularities.
In the introduction, it must be said that while the judges of this case claim that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Insolvency Act, the appeal court of the Fifth District in New Orleans says that the main procedure provides for a bankruptcy procedure in Mexico.
First of all, this would indicate the unknownness of international process cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In essence, a model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law was established for this purpose, which is determined by an arbitrator by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the vote of branches from the internal enterprise structure, when the debt of the maternal company of Vitro to branches is recognised, the majority required for the approval of restructuring would not be achieved.
However, this option is allowed by Mexican laws.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples of Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debt was handled by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after the votes of the branches, creditors - who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e., funds of "sups" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not reach a majority.
In voting, they would reach about 45% to 37.
The court of appeal does not take this injury.
On the other hand, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation that has been faced since 2008 - on the background of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company González Sady will appeal to a new evaluation directly before the appeal court, to take the evaluation for full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, because only three were initially voted.
If it fails here, it will be required as a remedy for the revision of the process of a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is important that the court mentions the document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae service, in which the Vitro procedure under the Competition Act is described in detail and indicates that the company has facilitated the law by appealing to the agreements signed by the 15-States to confront the chapter of the Competition Act with the two countries.
In addition, it points out that the country has undertaken the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, namely the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Attack on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Total evaluation
Without notice, a criminal notification from the Mexican Aviation Committee against the former owner of the company Gastón Azcárrago Andradem, which was denied by the fraudulent negotiations, was on the table for several months, and according to the union of pilots, the tank has already escaped.
The instance in charge of Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a complaint to the National Banking Commission and the Commission on Securities, which he accuses of obstructions in achieving justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to report to the Republic Prosecutor-General of the transactions carried out by this entrepreneur, in which the IXE bank of Fideics F/589 chose 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
The funds were most quickly aimed at buying shares Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As we know, Azcárraga Andrade is a major shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Martu Dresses
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens who approved the establishment of the association were gathered at the Universidad de Caribe Area on weekends to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kancun.
We are talking about a huge commercial and distribution centre with products from a "large wall country" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include the housing area for employees from 150 companies in the lower part.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has previously managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to build up against a monumental area that would in part deploy the protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the case with ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which the government did not take into account, and which requested an explanation under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador signed the Trade Agreement against counterfeiting, known under the English ACTA, was repealed, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Ownership (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As we know, it has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself excluded the possibility to consider it a threat to freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been engaged in this hall sport for more than 60 years and has processed the whole world thanks to it.
A few people in Portorico have such many memories of the history of local basketball, such as Héctor has "Hetin" Reyes.
In 2008, Reyes was burned in this sport for over 60 years, whether as a younger player, BSN national basketball league player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or president of the Portuguese basketball federation.
"I have grown a lot of roles throughout my life in basketball, including several at the same time as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the general agent of the national team and the president of the Federation," Reyes recalled during a visit to the Prime Hora newspaper at home in Bayamon, where he lives more than 50 years with his husband, Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not transfer in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and notes from his long career, prove that.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest movement from all the guards, those who reminded him of his action in the loss of Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was the player until 1982, at the same time celebrating 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
“It was my best summer, I enjoyed it most because I had the opportunity to join the Los Vaqueros team since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I divorced with one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in the BSN.
The team then took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
“I remember that Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here at the time at Alabama University in Birmingham, told me: ‘I have a two-meter-growing player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Portoriko ever had.
Bartow then advised me to play Raymond Gausse, who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamon a victory in the championship, then Gausse will contribute to another."
The championship, when the loss Vaqueros played Gausse for the team, enjoyed it, but only on a distance, because in 1988 he was already the President of the Basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position in the national team.
"I remember how we first defeated the United States in the 1989 Olympic qualification match in Mexico.
Then the world championship came in 1990, where we finished the neighborhood, but we had to have bronze not to be the Canadian arbitrator who allowed us to repeat the final invasion,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
He is one of the best, like the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Panameric Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we threw out the United States team, which was quite similar to the bronze made to us at the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León's brothers (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 due to play.
A man who may not have the perfect composition, but was able to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a team from the 1995 Olympic qualifications in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on letters such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players excluded for a defeat in the Panameric games in Mar de Plata, we have won gold despite all predictions.
What was the best player in Portorika?
It was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Portorica has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
It's not about his acting in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Portuguese coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla’s work from young people.
What is your success in the Federation as the biggest?
That I was part of the most famous national team era between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s, the BSN National League had up to 17 men in one season.
What didn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, such as the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Children are traveling a lot and playing too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistants of arbitrators and arbitrators.
I'm glad.
What are you focusing on now?
I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.

Actress Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was globally famous for John Rosse Ewing's main role, known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, in which he incorporated a man who acted unrespectably and was manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Ewing's cruel oil magnate in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. this year in a new series in Dallas, died, according to a family official announcement provided by Associated Press by the production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for cancer-related complications.
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown in Dallas, where he played the iconic role he loved,” his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagmane at the moment he died in the hospital in Dallas," said Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew.
"He was creative, great, funny, delicious, kind and talented, and will be terrified to me after him.
He was unique and lived his life full,” Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted he had drunk a lot for the summers.
In 1995, he was found in his liver with a devastating tumor and Hagman was transplanted.
Years before the Dallas series was broadcast, Hagman celebrated as a decent guy in a remote comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here was the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl (jin) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedians, which were broadcast only shortly: The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in the films included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was only Hangman's master's performance in the form of an incredibly deceitful J.R. that led him to the star's top.
The dramatic series of the CBS station about the Ewing clan and other characters around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shooted Javier?", which had to create expectations about the work of full of emotions when Hangman's character was almost killed, caused not only a huge number of speculations by audiences around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in stake offices.
This also helped this work to achieve a record of tracking.
In November 1980, the response was revealed, followed by an average of 41 million TV spectators, thus Dallas became the second most fun series in history after the end of the 1983 MASH series, followed by 50 million spectators.
J.R. fired his Swede Kristin (which played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. were pregnant and he then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left the city, but there were others who had reason to attack her.
Hagman played Ewing, an incredible charismatic laughter: an enthusiastic entrepreneur and an incredible husband, who tried to keep his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, closed to the hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the rock," said Hagman in 1988.
You should be there: "Here is the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he didn't happen.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone who was "light on the plate and outside of it."
It is unforgettable and unsubstitutable for millions of fans in the world and in the hearts of all of us who had the luck to know and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series broadcast TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"The recording of five parts of the second series has already been completed and the sixth has just turned," the TV station said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no declaration from Warner or TNT station on how the series would continue.
Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who has shine in classical works like South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when Larry was born in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry experienced luck on the theatre scenes in New York, and then served in England in the airline between 1952 and 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived in the city of California, Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he released his autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't see anything that I knew could hurt someone or hurt him in any way," said Prensa Asociada.
After liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped frightening patients.
"I advise them, I give them the courage, I meet with them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that explores "the end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Professor Stuart Charmé decided to do this semester a course about the end of the world, he knew that it was an insufficient fan: the end of the "long number" of May's calendar, which is to come on December 21, many people were caught as proof that the end of the world is coming.
However, Charme had no idea what he was waiting for in a few months: the disastrous hurricane Sandy, the budget loss that some call the “duty Armageddon,” and the growing conflict that Israel is enclosed, a place where Christians theory of the end of the world will begin the Apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this would be the worst semester than ever," Charmé told Rutgers University students this week at Camden, New Jersey.
When a person breaks down what is happening in the world today, as if we were staying for 30 days, it’s really a good time.
And remember that it means bad for apocalyptic thinking of good.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses on the "finding of the world" in this semestre, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Barry Vacker organizes a "Resources, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We decide why these thoughts are expanding over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behaviour.
For example, if nuclear material is put into the hands of terrorists, war may be out.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic topics and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” says Vacker.
At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a professional assistant in history of art and anthropology, were together to arrange a course with the simple name End of the world.
“We don’t connect to 2012 because we always count on the possibility of reorganizing the course if the world isn’t over,” Restall said.
Despite the "threatening destruction" students have to study, create projects and make final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held in the Apocalypse evening, giving students no other option than to work "until the evening of the world's predicted end," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He's gone in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-media students who signed up for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received an email asking if there is still room.
Students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I'm fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson at the University of Camden, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
So apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thinking is just a question of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a time when it could be taught,” he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no student, even professor, said he believed at the end of December 21.
"Our first project was discussing May's predictions and in some way we're deniing it," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student at Temple University of West Chester.
"Mays never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is a apocalyptic anxiety, which has been over a few centuries ago, which people respond to changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
The bloom of these speculations caused the internet.
"Where people don't think about it," he said.
This happens mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, asked if he knows about some course of "the end of the world," quickly answered.
"The Philippines will not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, noting an exception at the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years he spoke of many days of the last court, and said that if anything would happen on December 21, "people will begin to think about the next date immediately" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is lightweight by students and teachers.
Some of them said they intend to go to the celebration of "the end of the world."
"I'll call a few friends to laugh together," a 20-year-old communication student, Samira Ford, explained.
