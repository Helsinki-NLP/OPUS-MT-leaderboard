The Prague Stock Exchange has expired to the end of the trade
After the early morning loss, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares have reached nearly half of normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has linked to its Monday decline from the beginning of Tuesday trade, as it declined by nearly 6%.
This time, the loss of shares on Wall Street.
The market response to the U.S. House's vote result, which refused to support the financial sector's stabilization plan.
The fall of stocks in Asia
The dramatic decline in stock stocks in Asia on Tuesday, although the indexes eventually deleted some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong storms dropped nearly four percent during trading, but later some of the losses dropped and decreased by approximately 2.5 percent.
Hang Seng China Enterprises, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock stocks in Hong Kong, declined by 3.8%, Shanghai markets were closed.
The stock in Sydney lost more than five percent, but the loss eventually decreased to 4.3 percent.
According to the dark index, the Bursa in Taiwan declined by 3.6%.
"Termining a rescue action in the United States is uncertain and affects the financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, is determined by its own monetary policy, i.e., independent of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the U.S. legislators should quickly return to negotiations and approve the proposal for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the impacts will be felt by other countries.
Blood bath of American actions
The U.S. House of Representatives declined on Monday a plan to support the financial system, which would have been spent up to $700 billion ($12 billion).
The legislators ignored the challenge of President George Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. shares experienced bloody baths on Monday and the main share indexes saw the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index declined by nearly seven percent and a similar decline was recorded for the last time in 1987.
The Index declined before the vote, but as soon as it appeared that the proposal was not passed in the House, the Index appeared in a free fall.
Congress resigns: U.S. government can pay $700 billion to bank
U.S. Congress senior representatives and President George W. Bush’s government agreed to a broader form of financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
Voting about him will be at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators made a breakthrough in negotiations on the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid for the U.S. financial system of $700 billion (about 12 trillion krones).
However, the winning is not yet.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final form of the law.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the ground of the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was said by Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services.
According to sources, the Senate would probably vote on the plan early on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement should be that the rescue plan will be the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, there will be a "disambiguation" through the complexity of mechanisms that help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We’ve made great progress.
We have resolved our different opinions on how a market stabilization package looks like," Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to him, the final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form of the government fund.
It should purchase non-selling assets from financial companies that drag financial companies into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the edge of the definitive agreement of a plan that will work and must be effective in the market as well.
“It is necessary to continue the healing plan, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets that are sharply declining.
According to Nevad Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers strive to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress decisions could affect Monday trading.
However, it is still unclear when the two Chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, or whether the negotiations can be linked to a problem in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still aware of a number of changes.
The total amount intended for the aid of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amounts if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, in the next 100 billion dollars, and later 350 billion dollars.
Bush assessed the progress in negotiations
The President may vote on this decision, but the Congress may vote on his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained to obtain funding for the purchase of bad hypothetical securities, whose value failed because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgage.
"We worked everything.
House representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
With progress in negotiations, President Bush is also pleased.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciated the “extraordinary efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restrictions of golden falls
The President of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, Chief negotiator, said that lawmakers agreed to be responsible for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of delays, the timing of financing of the plan.
The new law should also restrict the so-called gold falls for the directors of the company participants of the programme and establish a committee that will be supervised by the Fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards a deal that will work and will be useful for the market as well as for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have problems with paying.
The government should negotiate new payments for the mortgage they buy, in order to reduce the monthly expenses on debtors’ payments and allow them to leave their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance, David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement it.
“And that’s because they don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will divide losses," Marek said this week to the iHNed.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important, according to Mark.
“A lot more important is that Congress members agree that this plan is supported and that it will be sanctified as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is the most important at this time,” Marek stressed.
Fight on knives: MP3 player against mobiles.
We advise how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It is clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to make a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use and the demands of the future owner.
It’s hard to get home a top expensive gramophone to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such music products on LP boards do not originate and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you have vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues in your regals, you are likely to dream about such a grammar at least.
The same is with music on the roads, i.e. compressed music, simplify - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on the player, as well as the fan of Pink Floyd can hardly try the earrings for twenty crowns on the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Determines the battery durability
Some top music players will manage much more than just play music, but what most mobiles do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone calling and esmeshing, it can play music and video, both record, it has a better, a worse camera here, and maybe it can also navigate.
And when we take smart phones and communications, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little wonder, because no freezer can grid, and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more mobile features you use, the sooner the indicator will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy roots.
A few mobiles can play music for more than 10 hours, usually much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the easiest) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, count on the fact that they will not play for you for more than a few hours.
If you call it here and there, take another charger to work for certainty - that applies even to more expensive devices.
You will not have this problem with MP3 players, even worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not every one can be connected directly to a computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a few card readers will be able to consult with the miniature memory cards that are used on mobile phones.
You don’t need any special software for players until the exceptions (iPod).
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobiles and players will already create a music library classified by the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre, or for example user reviews.
Some devices only display a tree directory structure similar to the Windows Explorer and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with the operating system).
Players tolerate toughness, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, focus on the battery durability, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and of course also on the comfort of control.
If music is mainly cult to you and you just listen to it every day for a short time in the tram, you’ll need any mobile that plays MP3.
That is what almost any mobile phone can do.
You don’t even have to watch the music formats of a mobile player or player.
MP3 will manage all and the entire majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread, and in addition to it, most of the devices will also be able to handle music in WMA format.
Less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) occurs.
Better mobiles also allow you to buy music online.
It’s enough to visit the operator’s website (or other providers) through the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be an underlying argument for the acquisition of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is usually limited only to fast-covered radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest as well.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way of selling music (be it through GSM, the Internet or the wireless internet) to the future of the music industry.
Most people still wear mobiles.
Whenever you get a taste of listening to something, the mobile you take in your pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always wear headphones or at least a wire handfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of mobile phones will be for many prizes.
The cheapest ones are usually less than 3,000.
In three and four thousand crowns, you will already get a very decent walkman.
However, most of you will limit the absence of output to ordinary hearing aids.
The best and technically the most equipped phones, even with a 3.5 mm headset for ordinary hearing aids, cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy to use.
The easiest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can really control everyone.
Minimum functions, the likelihood of controlling with a previous regular cassette or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There will be no risk of collapse in the form of an error on the mobile internet and subsequently an enormous account for data transfer.
What kind of apparatus to sail
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g., Vodafone 527) usually have slots on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
And with the purchase of the corresponding card you will enter into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can be used with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, click on Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don’t have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more challenging listeners, you prefer to check out specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operation approaches the separate MP3 player.
It is further in the Sony Ericsson sector, whose mobiles from the Walkman series have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 player.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery durability (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), MP3 player will take you from the above characters.
The first virtual operator will arrive in Czech Republic this year.
Or maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we miss something here - a virtual operator that would make the classics down.
Maybe it'll be missing for a long time.
The fact that the Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.co.uk many times.
Finally, it was also confirmed by the CTU, which noted that the price of SMS is higher with us than with the rest of the Union.
Following the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, it is possible that there will be a paradoxal situation - for some Czech mobile operators, SMS will be cheaper abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to go to battle.
Maybe it sounds paradoxal, but we have three mobile networks and penetration high over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to win that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often called upon by the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Pavel Dvořák, who in the past several times expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network is obviously no longer having too much chance (after all, it would probably be hard to look for frequency anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
Just the entry of virtual operators to the mobile market brought significant price reductions, to which even classic operators had to respond.
In the meantime, before entering the market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were voices similar to us.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
Finally, we don’t have to walk too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you of the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic owns U:phone, is also behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, it is enough for them much less customers than for a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of mobile networks.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced with a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a fairly good bet and a bet on a newly targeted target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
“Administrative guys choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual operator.
It’s hard to say if the same concept as in Poland could be caught in us.
The press speaker Vodafonu Miroslav Čepický said: “The Czech market is relatively small for segment approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offer."
In Czech Republic without a chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look too hopeful.
More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region,” said Jan Studničkova, the press spokesman of the Penta Financial Group in a telephone interview.
It was not so indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not enthusiastic about this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything to avoid any potential competitors.
I am interested in launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time not having a GTS Nover group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of O2 Telephone in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already succeeded in negotiating with some of them,” said Pavel Kaidl, a press spokesman.
Maybe they're shining for better times.
From informal information, the first virtual operator seems to be expected by the end of the year.
To date, however, its formation is carried out by an incomparable wall of silence.
“Now we don’t think there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-value virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has been informed of us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Srschen from the press committee Telefonicy O2 said in his statement for Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also addressed by other operators.
Martin Kemr, a press spokesman for T-Mobil, said in rare consensus with O2: "We have not yet recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business project on which we could further build."
He adds, "A virtual operator is hard to appear in the T-Mobilu network by the end of the year.
At this time, we have to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short term."
Vodafone draws its attention rather to meet the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
That’s what we consider the most convenient from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean a rise in competition, would lead to a price drop and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why do we make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to something to the operators, they can draw for a single stroke, the tanks around the formation of the U:phone.
Approximately the highest pressure towards the TSU went at the time of the formation of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
They testify to this publicly accessible information from the website of the TSO.
Now, however, U:fon fits as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemr said: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator to the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would put high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
However, because of this approach to mobile operators, the Czech regulatory authorities are directly impaired.
However, it is not only about the position of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other adult countries - has no power to intervene in competition.
These include exclusively the Authority for Competition Protection (OECD).
However, the whole problem was taken into account by his typical attitude.
The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible after a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator to rent the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded until now, as the offer of potential stakeholders was mostly not interesting enough for classical operators," said Christian Chalupa from the UOHS Foreign Relations Committee in response to our question.
It is probably not surprising from the representatives of the operators that this formulated statement.
From an office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one misuse his position on the market, it is more than serious.
Especially when Christian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators usually work, we can observe that their market entry has contributed to lowering prices for mobile phone services."
Obviously, however, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and price drops are not part of the interests of the UOHS.
In fact, shocking in the whole case, there is only an impressive confusion of three mobile operators resulting from their reactions.
The question is whether it really is just a random one, is offered by itself.
Just like the same price of gasoline for pumping stations is certainly just part of the accident and hard competitive fight.
"The Authority did not seek any signs of anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they have no adequate increased responsibility for their market actions.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual operators are also the most rapidly associated with the telecommunications regulator,” Chalupa said in a statement.
Interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points.
Obviously, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU that telecommunications are the single market in terms of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - to create a virtual operator, there is always a need for the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - it has a logic - on its network monopoly.
So in a certain segment it must be dominant.
However, even if we did not allow this argument, it should be a minimum warning for the UOHS that three mobile operators are supposed to act similarly.
At the same time, the complaints of a series of stakeholders (including the GTS Novera company mentioned) indicate that all operators in the negotiations have very similar obstacles.
Muscleing responsibility on the TSU is then a relatively common trick that the UOHS gives away from the whole issue.
We met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent amendments of the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the TSO’s powers to the field of competition in telecommunications has failed to achieve, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
This must be known by the representatives of the UOHS more than well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
It's going when no one looks
However, without notice, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators remains, which exist in the Czech mobile networks immediately.
They are companies that issue their own prizes for mobile phone services, which are public only partially.
It is usually a multi-level marketing company.
Your own mobile phone services such as Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many more.
The prices of these companies are usually only available to elected.
The magic is that the company acts against the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, you will receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar re-sales.
"If there were cases you were talking about, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in a cessation of cooperation with the company," Martin Kemr answered on our question.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activity would not be affected by responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of three of these companies, it may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators will be prevented by such a procedure.
In fact, these companies have unnecessary profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický notes the potential problems: “The law of similar speculation allows, however, services of these companies only use a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not driven to their name, so they cannot have it fully available as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that’s what it should be at least strange.
Furthermore, another question is open to the UOHS.
If mobile operators climb over a similar process of eyes, why block the formation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to disclose similar activities, and if it does not wish, it must not satisfy the operators’ explanation that they have no knowledge of anything like this and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As the text has fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators to the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in service prices.
At the same time, in almost all countries where virtual operators emerged, classic operators tried to defend their formation more or less.
Their arguments were practically identical - too small, or too saturated markets, quality problems, etc.
In advanced countries, however, the regulatory authorities have succeeded at the same time, which have failed the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and another one was wrapped on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators cross the whole case as a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclearness in their competences is more than appropriate in these cases.
But we don't put the flint into the grain.
If the cumulative information is correct and the virtual operator will appear with us very soon, the Czech mobile market may re-disambiguate.
If one of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult for the UOHS to remain unfair to reject (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we must stop calling courage than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four new versions of the Czech state hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek at the occasion of the Czech Nationality Day, celebrated new recordings of the state hymn where my home.
The hymn was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlavka.
There are four versions available - with a male or female salt singer, in the assembly and instrumental version.
The song was recorded by Katherine Psihnink and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the editing of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.com server.
Beloljavec considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He previously told the Czech radio that he deliberately chose to sing salt variants of singers with young representative voices, which are significant and popular.
“I’ve been with both of them from the beginning, and then I’ve also tried to take care of the congregation to have a clear diction so that the text can be understood well so that they can be confused,” he said.
The Czech National Hymn will celebrate the 175th anniversary of the following year.
The song Where my home singed for the first time in 1834 at the Stavovsky Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovacca Josef Kajetán Tyla, complemented by the music of Františka Škroupa.
She gained popularity and people sponsively took her for their own.
After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first slope of the song became a natural part of a national hymn.
One of the seven national symbols remained even after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
What sounds like a "new" hymn
Prague MHD on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of Prague Transport Company will be enrolled as a date when the first passengers will arrive in the subway, trams and buses who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of paper tickets.
At the moment, it is possible to have about 100 thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (this will be paid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time let upload to their chip card in infocenters and workplaces Transportation company in the metro stations Museum, Můstek, Holešovice Station, Angel, Roztyly, Summer, Kaňovy, Kobyly Raj
Coupons can also be purchased via the Internet from yesterday on the Transport Company website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who begin to use the online store can definitely forget the exit window in metro stations, where they have had to put regularly on long fronts on paper tickets.
The coupon is purchased via the Internet and it is uploaded to them on the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places there is a trained service overboard available to the passengers, which will help interested parties buy online and also replace a purchased coupon on their card," said Martin Opatrný, project spokeswoman.
In addition to the book, you will be able to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service machines that are installed in several metro vestibules.
How do these machines look like?
They are red, resemble tickets, and passengers may have already noticed them at the Metro stations Roztyly, Budějovsky, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavaska.
"Now there are five in the city, but by the end of the year they should be eighty," he added.
The coupon checks the location of the driver
The operation of the machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon is recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow will be paid not only in the capital but also in its vicinity.
Then in urban flags and bus lines with numbers of 300 to 499, which leads to the capital, mainly the inhabitants of the central municipalities.
"In the flags included in Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers to determine the time and bandwidth of the coupons," explained Philip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which composes the schedule of Prague public transport.
Direct buses have card readers built in the cash cabinet at the driver.
When you arrive, it is necessary not only to display a chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the destined place on the side of the cash.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of uploaded coupons, nothing is easier than to ask drivers for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel by buses and will not remember when the coupon expires, can return to self-service machines where the coupons are recorded on the card.
Here is information about the validity of their documents on the device display.
Judges want the U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Suez Germans asked for the inclusion of Schuma in the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the Southern Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
In 1945, some groups of Sued Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This comes from a letter that has been kept in a private archive and is stored today in the collections of the Southern Scientific Library.
Germans from the Czech Krumlov ask in the letter of the U.S. President not to allow the return of the "shumav bourgeois" - banned by Hitler under the Munich agreement - back to the Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that American units come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," writes the letter, "People whose fate lies in the heart."
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia is allegedly giving Sudanese Germans, in the knowledge of the Czech national nature, hope only for brutality, incomprehension, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors ask the U.S. President to take over the protectorate for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign state that prints and exaggerates minorities and nothing, nothing has contributed to the victory of the United States," he said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly concerned about the revenge of "the Czech oppressors".
If the President of the U.S. suspected of thinking about the Germans, it was enough to organize a referendum on whether its residents would like to become part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter can sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of compulsory history, some monuments say it correctly doctrinates the expectations of the then Sued Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least realize that it was going to be their departure from the Republic, only few of them allowed such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the UK to negotiate some kind of autonomy to Sudetes.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Budjeovics.
He was in the war as a Buddhist German settled to the navy in the Baltic.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would get their cheese," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in the Czechoslovakia did not count on the fact that they would be dismissed from the Republic under the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action focused on road safety in Czech history.
However, it should be characterized by an emotional media campaign that it intends to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Alese Řebíčka’s office promises to dismiss drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheelchair.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, movies, on the internet, but also on the airlines.
The drivers should be distracted from fast driving and alcohol behind the wheel.
Remind them also that before they leave, they may be dismissed.
He wants to focus primarily on young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and professional drivers.
What will happen soon?
Mostly human stories that attack emotions.
And this is the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "not thinking" is written by big letters on the experiment.
And in the blood cloth, the word "you pay" is.
This must symbolize that a person can pay for his own life in a moment of ignorance.
The spectators will "threate" the spots until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can usually be seen with drastic images of victims of accidents.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead people on the Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and bite on drivers
"The drivers have a sugar and beef system.
Sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to red, it saves time.
A storm is a threat to punishment or accident.
The drivers must be reminded of the risk,” says the transport psychologist of Na Homolce Hospital Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in the press and mainly negative advertising, less psychologists.
It says that the tables are less effective, which warns drivers about the danger.
"When a static warning table is installed, it will probably soon climb with the surroundings and the drivers will not be devoted to it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli President Ehud Olmert spoke to return virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including pre-Jordan, eastern Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did this in an interview that was printed by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories will be required to return, unless all at all,” Olmert said in a newspaper.
“We will hold a certain percentage of these territories, but the Palestinians will have to pay a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without that,” he added.
He admitted that the possible return included East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or buldozers to want his legs, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to give up the part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in a statement on two July attacks in the city, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places" within the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
“It won’t work,” he continued.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also pronounced Israel to leave the Golan Highs, which, according to him, is an inconceivable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require certain efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving Golan," he said.
“They know well what they will have to give up to win the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up permanent support provided by terrorism (Sihite movement) Hamas, Al-Qaida, and Jihad.
Questions after the accident: Are stevardi in the bus illegal?
The law doesn’t know how to walk in a distance bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident, Student Agency near the Italian Padovy raised the question of whether stevardi and passengers can travel by bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of stevard is in contradiction with the road traffic law," said the spokesman of the transport ministry Karel Hanzelk.
The accident in which a 20-year-old stevard died last week was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus the road.
The girl sadly sat next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she has two more places reserved.
However, the bus can disaster or crash, even when Stevard distributes coffee or newspapers.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with stations according to the technical certificate.
If the bus is not approved, the passengers must sit.
Remote buses Student Agency do not have parking spaces; this is confirmed by Radim Jančura, director of the company.
“We and the ministry did this and initially did not allow the movement of passengers.
Afterwards they revoked it and we found that passengers can walk on the toilet if they have their own seat,” he said.
The law of Stevard does not know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stevard - no legislation will solve this role.
However, no legislation prohibits or prohibits transporters from providing services.
The road transport law only knows the term of the driving vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," says the spokesman Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Joseph Pokorny, director of the Department of Transportation Road Vehicle Operations, believes that the law addresses the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space permitted in the approval.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into towns where there are stations and limited maximum speed, intercity stations with high-speed stations and remote stations with high-speed high-speed stations and seats equipped with security belts.
As in the plane, an expert says.
The BESIP expert on transport safety Jaroslav Hořín in the movement of stevards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
“A lot of risks are not at risk when driving, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
It’s not sure when turbulence will come, and the airplane can get into the head.”
"But if the bus sounded fast, of course, physical laws would apply.
Just like in the city bus or tram.
The safety of stevards must deal with carriers by internal regulations," he says, and also less, the problem is not solved in terms of law.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers stewards services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The Director does not consider their profession as a risk even after an accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I'll cancel them.
Travellers can get coffee and newspapers on arrival.
It would save costs too," he says.
As an interest in security, he justified the absence of stewards in his cars by Asian director Alexey Litvin, who operates a breakdown of lines compared to SA.
“We don’t have any stewardships, we’ve been standing against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end with a deadly level,” he said a few years ago.
It has become an incomparable tragedy
In an accident of a line link to Naples, a young stevard from Plzeňsk, who worked for the company for two years, died.
The Slovenian truck probably dropped off without using the guideline from the stopline and blocked the bus journey.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he took the right front part on him.
To be sold two places reserved for the rest of the stevards, Jančura refuses.
"These places cannot be booked in remote connections, they are blocked."
The company is planning to complain about the driver of the truck.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait at the court's edge, but expects a financial compensation from the guilty.
The correction of the law?
Inspectively
Specification of the movement of stevards on the bus could lead to an amendment of the law on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working over a year.
“There was no concrete conclusion.
Buses do not even solve too much, rather a point system, the highest speed on the road and the use of mobile when driving,” says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stevards to be something that would significantly threaten passenger safety," said Hanzelka, who said that the control of bus safety is in the power of police and labour security authorities.
Hope for Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The big words in a letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the bank are missing.
By connecting the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, the "central institution of a financial group of savings for trading on the capital markets," we read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to a letter, WestLB introduces a "set of competences" to ensure long-term income.
And, at all, such associations can be a decisive impulse to further associations in the sector of land banks.
Such texts emerge when the leadership wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a difficult period.
The WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervision Office, whose message to the country’s government in North Perth-Westfalia that it is time to find solutions for the future, is still fresh.
The link between Deka-Bank, which customers have saved for its investment funds, and WestLB, regardless of any kind, has been discussed for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Deka-Bank Franz Waas, chief of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, was told that in the fusion of his banking house at Mainzer Landstraße with some of the land banks such as Helaba or WestLB, there was no sense.
However, the Deka-Bank Board, followed by one-half of the land banks and the other-alliance, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct conversations with WestLB on joint business activities.
This may be a trade in the capital market or part of it.
However, the interviews have just begun, they are affected by the finances.
The Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial market, will not be discussed for the first time in relation to consolidation in the financial sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba bank.
In the end, there was nothing from this triangle.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessen national government spoke against the participation of the Helaba bank.
Both the remaining banking houses haven’t failed.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, speculations have repeatedly occurred about connecting Deka-Bank to land banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, President of Helaba’s Bank’s headquarters, has been negatively expressed in speculations about the connection of his financial house with others.
However, it appears that, independently of this, the conviction is that a closer approach to different banking homes in the public sector is a need.
Now after the elections to the Bavarian National Assembly, the BayernLB connection with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to start.
That's not a good news for Helabu.
If pressure should rise to further mergers, it gradually comes from possible partners for such connections.
In the south, only the second round would be played, although the financial crisis is far better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Connection with WestLB again at the beginning of the year prohibited the spatial banks of Hessen-Thüringen, which have a share of fifty-eight percent in Helabia.
This would be the most important of the Nord LB.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is the question of how much business models of individual institutions work together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of what business model should be ensured the future competitiveness of land banks, the German Union has spared and the banks have not answered yet.
It could also end the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, in the letter of the Dangerous Governance, it is also mentioned that they are trying to find a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
How and how it will be possible to connect each component to Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as "The Weekend with Italy"
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca, the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena will be like her girlfriend, and so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter court of the Kaiser, there is a stronger sweater and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest show how deep tones can push his throat.
Elena Lucu will dance first and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking near Puorta Nuova station, four buses will depart tonight at 23:45 with the label "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses include mainly Italians, and in one bus only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans sing with their flag, they celebrate at night.
And that's what Marco Guarda says, that's nothing for Italy.
Marco, who has a long jacket with a leather-size underwear and glasses with wide silver curtains, these three buses belong to him.
They have been on the Oktoberfest for five years, but only this year they have three trips.
In the night there, through the day between the beer stands, at 22:30 departing back.
Staying at night would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs €75 including a welcome beer by Kaiser, cooked precisely under the Bavarian beer purity law, health insurance and German-speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses depart at night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
Beer is not given, not yet.
The bus quickly quiet, passengers sleep.
They do well, they will still need their forces.
It takes place in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the road number 8 before Munich you take another stop and many other buses with Italian recognition mark.
When Marcova’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at midnight in the morning, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering together, Marco's last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First of all, put on a yellow hat.
It is written on the left of Švabachem "Octoberfest", next to Marco's website: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "as soon as the door opens into the beer tent, flee!" Marco cries out in the morning.
"Let's go!" Let's go and place places in the back of the tent.
"Not in advance to prevent you, and not all the yellow caps on the same lace, place the space!"
It costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the wrong.
“Let the securities show us that we behave well.
As soon as you leave your places, they're gone!"
Third, "Be here tonight at half an hour." You understand?
And up to Wiesn, a place with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group pushes yellow caps as brands on trees, cedules and even on the electoral poster of a large Bavarian party.
You need to prepare for the departure.
The weekend with Italy is known as the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
The exact number of visitors isn’t available; it’s about fifty thousand people traveling through the Alps and falling into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors came from Italy this weekend.
The Monaco police lines will strengthen seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads national statistics, in which Italians (about 60 interventions) and Rakušany (about 80) with about 200 medical treatments include the first place.
The tent of Hofbräu is especially popular with the Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician has used the word "relatively" and has also included the fact that the German banking sector will not remain savings of crisis development.
That's what happened last weekend.
The Dax-controlled financial house specialized in the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will be obtained from the consortium of several billion loans of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person informed of the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit aid would reach up to €35 billion.
The interest will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the actual amount.
The money comes from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa’s subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, this state finance has refinancing extremely short-term projects for which money is borrowed, which is no longer possible now because of the lack of trust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve decreased by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of its own capital decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Regular revenue and net revenue from financial transactions compared to last year decreased to zero, revenue from the increased value of credits and certain securities, and also from the withdrawal of credit trading reserves decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher revenue from refunds for the subsequent accounting costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from interest refunds under the tax regime and for the mediation of the trade for group companies, the 16 per cent decline on the side of revenue was still moderate.
In 1990, the former state financer burned on mortgages for livestock, which were then separated from the service portfolio and subsequently led by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little public finance in classical financing, Depfa was stronger engaged in infrastructure projects and financed joint private investors and state partners (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
The value of his subsidiary now has to reject Hypo Real Estate, and these withdrawals will have a "suppliant material effect" on the calculation of profits and losses of the entire group, as some have uncertainly heard.
The fact is that the dividend will not be.
For 2007, it was shortened by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important financial instrument of state and infrastructure projects since Depfa took over.
Stronger than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans almost dried out because the banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate requires short-term refinancing funds annually for a part of the Depfa credit portfolio – approximately €50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate statement, the group’s financial needs are covered by this loan for a period of time and the company is protected “from the influence of the international monetary markets at the moment to a significant extent incomplete functions”.
Other sources have not been heard that these funds have been refinancing by the end of 2009.
The President of HRE Georg Funke said the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the cash markets at the same time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the Hypo Real Estate Group’s competitiveness on the market is now guaranteed.
This is what shareholders and bank creditors trust.
But with regard to the dynamics and inseparableness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, it cannot be excluded either the opposite.
After the bank late on Sunday afternoon, according to everything standing against insolvency, it cannot be preliminary, rescue to calm up passion.
The share rate decreased by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond courses were well maintained.
While preferential debt has virtually failed, the secondary bond courses are losing more significantly.
This applies primarily to bonds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and logically bonds with expiry period after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally seemed to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculatives, but their stability needs to be understood, depending on the stability of the international financial system, after considering the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which took it into the company by taking Depfa.
As long as emissions banks, governments and less disabled business banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate securities in their expiry period.
However, it can also happen that almost no one is now daring to hope - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming simultaneously with this partial settlement, the probability of limiting to certainty has now become just justified hope.
This particularly long-term creditors will probably prepare a number of troubled nights when they will decide to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors may use the limit line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the exchange revenue of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital revenue taxes.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, sixteen-year-old, will be introduced to the first day of high school in Tachiban, girls will begin to move: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mang. On her new blog she tells about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I had been tortured from the way to school.
I live on the coast of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and 40 minutes by train to the center of Tačibaná.
I had to find the road myself, fortunately, I didn't lose myself.
It seems that the beginning of the Tachibanese lesson is not as strict as at home in the Lower Saska.
Students will start meeting after eight hours and twenty minutes before nine, a short session with the teacher, called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I had to imagine.
I am not the kind of person I like to talk to people, not even to 40 students.
Because I hadn't had a school uniform yet, I took my old-fashioned mother-in-law dress for blues, blue shoes and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the lake and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajónara Wo še Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and I have my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very pleased that I started learning the language two years ago.
All the 31 girls in the class were shit, shit and shit, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
That's what I knew about my mangs.
It belongs to the basic dictionary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I hurried into my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite widely, she thought it was a honor that a foreign student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong answered, I was literally exhausted.
They talked each other, and they asked me about the possible and impossible - and at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
All of them broke their bents on the break.
My host mother also made me a box for lunch - and that's something else than boring German cows.
I had rice with herbs, small pairs, salad of eggs and rice, fruits and some fish in tofu cabbage.
I don’t know exactly what I am doing here in Japan.
These things look special and taste quite new.
It is sure that everything is really good.
Well, maybe to the salt loaded shells, bl.
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives the boy a hand-made bento, which is particularly artificially adjusted in this case, and hopes that the boy will know more about the pause in the chicken.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school a year in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it just fascinates me."
I’ve been reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started to learn Japanese a little once.
It was clear that I would have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, habits and habits.
And they're high-priced here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen.”
And the cruises have feelings.
When a crash or shark flees from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
But how can it be verified that they feel the same when they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has published posts of well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without proof?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other state of consciousness without me or anyone else to prove it, when we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to devote ourselves to another kind and open questions of perception or general awareness, we enter the inconvenient territory because the hardware does not agree.
When the cruise becomes in danger, it will do the same as many other animals: he will claim that he is dead, crash or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists are deprived of comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our subjective experience to animal experience.
It is also because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include side-side prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and executive or management functions).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems that other creatures are completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that a person differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic particularity could hide the human linguistic essence: since so much of its perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if the consciousness of the language does not matter, the language would certainly influence it, so that the animal consciousness, whether it is constructed in any way, would probably differ from most of the state of our consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to find out how consciousness appears in other animals.
When, as a matter of inner and subjective, it is not possible to measure or, because of the special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experiences, its examination is made up of big problems.
Most of my performances relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to investigate animal consciousness processes regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially for example visualization.
But this approach, devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, is focused rather than on neurological correlates of consciousness than on casual mechanisms: both can be identical, but maybe not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of nonfrontal cortex for visualisation.
What is the result of feelings?
I drive them out of the fact that an emotional system, such as a system of fear, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
“What we call fears is a mental state in which we are when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
Seeing from this point of view, the feelings are closely associated with those areas of the cortex, which are characterized by the primacy, and in particular people.
In conjunction with linguistic nature there is a fine deviation of perception, because by means of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize the conditions to attach them to others alongside ourselves.
On the contrary, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings are derived from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain cells devoted to body sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain cells.
Since this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could be quiet to participate in the feelings perceived by several animal breeds.
I can't object to this, but I think it's unproofable.
Pankseep argues that what we feel in the crash and people are likely to feel like fear both organisms: but how can it be verified, Pankseep says, are crashes and people feeling the same when they behave similarly?
Shame against the danger of shower - does he feel fear too?
From my point of view, only behavioral similarity cannot prove the compatibility of experience.
It is true that the neuronal comparison is assessing us further: crashes and people have similar brain tribes, on the contrary, not even the brain.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in crossing?
I think the crusheds and other seeds, perhaps even the seeds (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are likely to differ substantially from those of us (because human consciousness is based on special circles and language), I prefer to explore emotional behaviour rather than emotional perception.
Anyway, in this case, we can expect progress at the neurological level if we are going to measure the same in crash and in humans.
I don’t know the language and the consciousness of my mind, I don’t know the feelings, because I don’t know if they exist.
It is possible to consider it short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly jump to the wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA Platini President: Duration of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Representative Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said the preparations will soon be led by direct President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to arrange ME with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
It’s just started and there’s a lot to do in both countries.”
In the early completion of the timetable of construction or construction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts climb.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work as soon as possible now,” said President of the Ukrainian Union, Grigorij Surkis.
"Uefa will keep watching us constantly."
Another radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN was revoked by the National Olympic Committee after several scandals and replaced by an independent manager, Robert Zawlockim.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewieckie.
"There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki said to the Polish press agency PAP.
“Uefa President Michel Platini’s letter made sure that this step will neutralize the preparation for ME 2012.”
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to forced down in the last season because of manipulations, and eventually even had to move the start of the league quickly.
Destroyed Dennis Quaid returns to hits
She wanted to advertise a new film, talked about private things - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a distorting marriage.
He's blowing and coming back.
The delayed war of roses at the former spouse Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after divorce, these two Hollywood actors lead an irreversible dispute - in front of the public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first expressed the reasons for her marriage crash: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
He said he learned about the scope of fraud after divorce.
The motive for this mental stripper was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a twisted marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his presentation as an incredible husband was significant: “He’s crazy,” said a 40-year-old actor in the New York Daily News that “Meg repeatedly revives the history of our relationship and adjusts it.”
In addition, it is "political" that a common sixteen-year-old son Jack again "remends publicly the pain and radical changes that are a divorce for each child."
While Ryan lives alone from divorce, Quaid has been married again and has recently become a twin father.
His thoughts about motion end up as follows: “My life is going on everywhere.
I think I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing great.”
Flight prices and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one recent study, flights were even more than 50% cheaper in Germany.
Flights and accommodations in hotels have rediscovered - this is the result of a study of American Express travel and financial services providers.
The company analyzed its data on the reservation made from the first half of 2008 and, after the rise of prices in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been discounted.
From January to March, prices increased by 41 out of 48 observed European cities by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most beautiful trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37% less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is that American Express considers a weak exchange rate of the dollar, causing "the decreasing taste of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices has also been more severely affected by financial centers than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne nad Rhine or Stavanger.
In this city of Norway, hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
Flight prices have also shown a rise trend in the first quarter:
Due to the destruction of kerosine, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-distance flights have even decreased by up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the price of tickets in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quartet, but changes in knowledge in Business and First-Class classes were less significant.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they increased by 11.9%, in the second quarter, they declined by 23.6%.
In German national flights, according to the study, prices dropped by even half.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the aviation market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the stressed situation is the disruption of non-profit airlines by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared the competition in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one branch and simple methods, Hamburger SV comes to the front of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukayov is still unable to build a functioning eleventh.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to increase the unexpected landing for the representative of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach joined the game until late and failed with a balloon on the back.
His report was precisely formulated and sounded convincingly out of his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger at the hamburger arena cabins.
There was a lot in the catacombs, the break between the half-time ended, and most people were sitting in their places again.
After almost three decades, Rieger was a physiotherapeut of HSV and enjoys greater respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Coach assistant Cornelius Jol attracted and lifted his finger to the sign of conformity.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
His commandment sounded like this: here with the second goal!
The execution has not occurred.
"We haven't tried anything well today," later said Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt would like to be more relaxed.
With 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers thank Mladena Petriće (11) and the circumstances that the weak Gladbash could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of its existence on Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and a lively updated table on the video wall, in which their team was introduced as a premium.
It's going to be your birthday without a good party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the ongoing table result symbolizes rather the incalculability of the league than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevese and Silva, the portman Petriće and from FC Bayern received Jansen - is slowly located, but it is still unable to shine.
"We need more quotes and more dribling," Jol insisted.
After the defeat in voting
The fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first reports on the rescue package caused a drop in the Dow Jones index by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow picked up something again.
At around 20:30, this world’s most important stock exchange barometry showed a 5% decline to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
The worst was in Dowa at the moment American Express, who lost nearly 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles were able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs’ shares have lost nearly 10%.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett was a major investor in the company.
The rescue plan should provide funds for the purchase of so-called corrupted mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid on a scale, but in a few stages.
In return, the State should receive an optional list of financial companies that could be paid in favour of the exchange rate, reducing the burden for the state budget.
Action courses in Europe are slowly falling
Billionary aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not have any doubts about investors.
The share rate of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly decreasing and downloads the Dax index.
The American Dow Jones index is losing even though the state’s planned financial market is rescued.
Spectacular exchange rate losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank strhly the German stock index (Dax) deep into minus.
The Monaco real estate financer’s share has lost even after the rescue of the federal government and private banks up to three quarters of its value, Commerzbank has reached more than 20 percent.
Dax cleared under the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and recorded 5,839 points with a minimum of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets went to the knee.
In New York, a business day began on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s rescue package of $700 billion would not have to stay enough to restore financial market events.
During the first hour of trading, Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent, so it was 10 809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives has to vote on a rescue plan, the Senate may be expressed on October 1.
The other European storms were taken in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2%, and the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese leader index of Nikkei declined by 1.26 percent after initial profits to 11,743.61 units.

Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has uploaded 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism company also announced that its shares in Thomas Cook are not selling.
Dark matter affects the years of space probes
Scientists haven’t been aware of one mysterious phenomenon for years: dark matter affects the speed of space tests during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitating practice).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory should not be completely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space sonda "Ulysses" flew into space.
The faults of fuel pipes, which will soon be frozen, are now threatened to death in winter.
Among scientists, for years, one mysterious phenomenon has been working on confusion - an anomaly of gravity.
Gravitation practice is an air maneuver of space probes, where they gain extra flexibility in the gravitational field of some space body, such as Earth.
This allows the test to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research sondage Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar sondage.
But what scientists say in this case for years in surprise: the flying bodies do not behave 100% as a man would expect according to the old good gravity law.
On the contrary, irregularity occurs at speed.
Surveys are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, the physicians have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by an anomalie of gravity.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of the matter by covering space, should not have been completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler, from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, is still convinced that Einstein did not mistake, and is trying to explain the anomalies of the gravity practice using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The responsible for this anomalie could be a dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he wrote.
The existence of dark matter is known by universe researchers for about ten years.
It is apparently based on gravity force, the effect of which on another space body can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just not even visible light.
According to scientists, a fifth of the total mass of the universe is good from this dark matter.
In Egypt, tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Foreign Minister’s statement, tourists are deported again in Egypt.
Sudan’s kidnappers demanded a few million euros of redemption.
He said six kidnappers were killed in the shooting before the release.
Five Germans were captured in the south of Egypt.
The redemption is already running.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists’ dressing in the Sahara are free, according to all.
They also reported the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station of Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our co-citizens and other craftsmen were released.
We're just checking their health condition," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State TV, there are five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians, and also their eight Egyptian guides in a safe and secure manner.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are already on the way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting is still unclear: According to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the military surprisedly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the redemption," said the employee.
He said, "It was just about taking it up," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two of them were arrested.
The kidnappers asked for a redemption of six million euros in Germany; the money was transferred by the German wife of one of the handhelds.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" with a complaint to one of the German mediators said the release of the arms is extended because the kidnappers are afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release a handheld woman after paying the redemption.
Men should be kept until the kidnappers have a safe escape path.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to express this report.
The abuse is "released to suicide"
A number of abuse of fathers led a woman to killing herself, sounded before the court.
After he admitted to eight cases of sexual disturbance, seventy-year-old Michael Trerise from Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
Truro’s Crown Court heard that his unownered daughter, Stephanie Randle, regularly bonded her between five and seven years of age.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
The court also said that Ms. Randle died at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she was a kid in Coventry, Trerise tied her to her eyes and then abused her sexually while her mother worked in the hospital.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, Mrs. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a National Trust volunteer, had pursued a pattern of abuse that was committed twice a week on her.
The prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in 2006 that friends of Mrs. Randle, who also highly devoted to surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and "released her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is supposed to have been kidnapped with a igelite bag.
Randle stood in the face of her daughter's unownered father, who wrote a confession, ending the words: "I bind her and bind her eyes.
"I didn't abuse it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: “You are extremely strange fetishist and for your victim it had to be terrible when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends by taking the victim's life.
Even more terrifying is the fact that if she did not do so, she wouldn’t have been asleep at the court at all.”
"I would particularly like to emphasize the consequences, according to Stephanian's parents, your crime on their daughter in those years," he added.
"Of course, it would be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC learned that a government official who left strictly secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man left two strictly secret documents on the train at Waterloo at a time when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is at least a serious offence against that law and nothing indicates a crime intention.
BBC Defence Writer Frank Gardner said that such a plan would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter would be resolved internally between the Ministry and the Office of the Government," he said.
An employee who may not be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act concerned, which is the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police of the Officer complain on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al-Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and moved from home to an unknown place.
Social backups face debt B&B
The British soccer backups may have to deal with the debt of more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley banks.
The government has provided 2.6 million customers to protect their deposits in Bradford & Bingley £14 billion.
The interest rates of this loan will be paid to all companies taking customer deposits, including 59 affiliates.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Associates (BSA), said that it is "degrading" that the backups and their members must pay.
The debt of 14 billion will be paid by being rescued by Bradford & Bingley’s mortgage.
However, the interest rate that is growing will be paid every year for all 700 financial companies taking customer deposits.
The Fund’s Compensation Money Services Plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 corporate funds are included in this number.
It's humiliating that these institutions who acted carefully now have to pay some accounts of those institutions who were not so discreet.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the deposits should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the debt interest rate will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that backups will have to find £81 million to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Commercial Societies, said the BBC was convinced that it was not fair.
“It is humiliating that those institutions that have been treated considerably during the differentiation of the housing market now have to pay some accounts of those institutions that have not been so considerably.”
According to the BSA, no backups since 1945 have failed.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what the possibilities are to protect the joint backups and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest rate in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be paid throughout the year and it could be almost twice as much.
Since joint deposits are shareholders without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk raises 5 pens per liter
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy said it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pounds per liter from Monday.
This year, it is the second price rise after two-pension betrayment in February, and comes after research carried out by the advisory company.
Retailers should decide themselves whether they want to reflect betrayment at customer prices.
Before the rise of February, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey last changed in 2002.
Causes for Bangladeshi Prime Minister Rejected
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request of former Prime Minister Shaj Hasina Vadjid to be released, which means that if he returns to his country, he can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to give her a claim in connection with the accusation that she had earned more than fifty million dollars (729,700) when she was the prime minister.
The case is one of the several accusations of corruption that are brought against it.
Chalid Zija, a long-term political rival Shajch Hasiny, was released earlier this month for a case.
Shaj Hashin will return to Bangladesh over the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), asked her to give her full freedom first by the local army held by the government.
Writers say that while she was released to be honest to have a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear, under the conditions of her release, whether she remains free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say they are now appealing to the Supreme Court against the regulation of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected the Shaj Hasin's request for a case with the fact that it does not need a case when an investigation is already undergoing abroad for an honest statement," said the defendant, Rafique-ul Huq, said.
"We are appealing against the Supreme Court's regulation."
Her lawyers said she needed a charge to return to the country from abroad for preparation for December elections.
The High Representative of the People’s League said that Shaj Hashin would return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the temporary government had taken power, but she was released from prison in June so she could go abroad for a medical procedure.
Shahish Hashin and Chalid Zija both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of reverse vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children have not participated in recent anti-reverse vaccination due to violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations vaccinated in six provinces last week.
However, he says he could not reach children in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
The UN spokeswoman said that even despite the Taliban’s promises, it would not attack or defend thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB lost court dispute on ITV
BSkyB has lost a court dispute over the review of the Commission’s competition decision which has ordered the company to reduce its share in ITV’s competitive broadcasting.
BSkyB’s appeal court ordered to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9 % below 7.5 %.
The Commission previously declared that BSkyB’s share had a competitive struggle and gave the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased its share in 2006 in a store that, as a result, prevented NTL from buying, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of ITV share by BSkyB had made a reason for doubts about ITV independence, and called on the Commission for competition to initiate the investigation.
Chief of the Virgin Consortium Sir Richard Branson, the Consumer Organization and the Regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportionate solution - especially because BSkyB previously said she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New Investigation of the Affiliate of American Lawyers
The U.S. chief prosecutor appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the Afer report developed by the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report was criticized by officials of the White House, lawyer and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalese.
The investigation was motivated by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the interrogation officials during the investigation had lied to investigators in order to deny justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a report, "The controversy, including potential criminal proceedings, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to speak was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice released nine American lawyers in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry said the lawyers were released for weak executions.
However, later it turned out that the release of lawyers was not assessed for nothing worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to the conclusion that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the investigation of high-built Republican deputies and senators, while others refused to investigate the accusations of deceiving voters against Democrats.
U.S. lawyer investigates and conducts complaints in court cases to the government.
They may be released at any time, but they should not be removed for political reasons.
Minister Alberto Gonzales, the head of the Justice Department, was fired and finally resigned for his release.
Many other ministers of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The General Inspector's report expressed the role of Gonzalese in the affair very critical, saying that he was "the main responsibility" for dismissal that he "abdicated" from his lead position and was "not remarkably engaged in the event".
Other officials, including former senior adviser of Bush, Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's party will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for its epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who will come to the ceremony for his special gold prize next weekend in London said he was "recognized" by a recognition.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The nomination for this year is led by the Coldplay group, which has reached a narrower selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, the chief editor of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with the instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and reached the top fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell was held in the band for about nine years and sold it over forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name of Marvin Lee Aday - suffered health problems in recent years, and was also operated in 2003 due to irregular heart rate after collapsing on the stage.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later appeared to have a cyst on his voice.
Obscur streets, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York has thousands of roads, streets, roads and other land communications, some famous, some just useful.
But even many taxi-veterans and long-term locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village district and leads north of the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is rather like a traced passage than a trace.
There are no cedules with street names.
In the usual atlas, it is practically invisible.
However, the street has a fan.
For example, Avalon Bay, the developer of newly built luxury buildings on the First Street.
The Extra Place wants to newly explode and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques to open in new buildings.
Other fans are long-time neighbours who say they were shortened by the streets simply because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was worsened.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of a Building, which has its power, is not the least interested in keeping it.
At a meeting of the ground committee of the municipal community, representatives of the city office and Avalon Bay planned to buy the street developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers such a variant when the streets will remain in the hands of the city, asking for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city owns very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to stay in its possession," she said.
"Proposals may be made for repair and management, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public accessibility."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that she wants to newly explode a small street and set seating places, some of which would use a cafe, whose interest in renting space is expected by the developer.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this deserted street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she added.
Seth Donlin, spokeswoman of the Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the streets, and suggested that his office's task was to develop property rather than manage.
Compared to his more colorful neighbourhood, Bowery, Extra Place left a trace in history.
Some people think that the streets got their name in 1802 when Philip Minthorn's large farm was split between several of his children and no one was entitled to that narrow stream of the land.
The back door to the Extra Place led to the CBGB, a punkrock monument, which closed in 2006, and the street is possibly the most known as a photo background on the Ramones album's "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who made a photo in November 1976.
"It was full of waste, broken clothes and pieces of barleys, plaques, leaves and stripes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the East Village neighborhood, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public assets should be kept secret.
Others consider Extra Place a rarith - almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who wrote a blog in the name of Jeremiah's missing New Yorker (subtitled "The Book of the Neck: a Gorgeous Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Destruction"), published part of the story about Extra Place from the New Yorker heading, which appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark even in the day, confined by cutting iron doors of warehouses and closed windows, where the old newspapers runs a week in the string."
A couple of exceptions, the street of one lately evening seemed quite the same.
The cruise went through the blind end of the street near the door, which once led to the CBGB, where the store of expensive clothing stands today.
There was graffiti on the walls, and in addition to the fresh doses of the newspapers, there were empty bottles of beer.
A couple of people around said that Extra Place was rarely thinking, but suggested that some check could be taken to him.
On the contrary, Fields said that he thinks some people underestimate the influence of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in places dark, wet and resilient."
Discussion on bilinguality: sealing in English
In this edition, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic employee from California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book “Worse than you think: why the high school needs to choose schools.”
To speak effectively to Spanish voters is a shameful issue.
Barack Obama’s educational agenda just proves that.
Obama’s campaign underlines that “Afro-American and Spanish students have a significantly lower probability that they will learn than white students,” which is true.
In order to fight such performance differences, Obama promotes the educational agenda in particular, among other things, "transitional two-language education" for those who only learn English.
However, the question to Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Let’s take an example of Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in Los Angeles east.
Students of this school are in most cases Hispanic from low-private families.
More than one-third of students, many of whom have recently received, are only learning English.
Nevertheless, the state mathematics tests in 2008 reached the highest level of an incredible hundred percent of the fourth-class students.
Almost as amazing ninety-three percent of the fourth-class students got to the highest level in state tests from English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, continuous assessment of abilities and access without excuse.
In addition, and that should be noted, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are only learning English is "complete injury".
Invasion in English emphasizes the practical use of English in teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a huge success with one completely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would go to class and don't know who it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Will Obama take a Sixth Street Prep school as a model of how other schools should look with large percentages of Spanish and English students?
The results that the school achieves should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (National Education Association is a long-term supporter of two-language education) and its own consistent support for two-language education.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, it has recently trivialized when he stated that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, “you should make sure your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to delete performance differences, he should rather think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than laughing and trivialising them.
Oil is steadily falling due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply due to concerns that even the U.S. plan to rescue financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
The prices of termined oil stores fell in the morning trading at the New York Commodity Exchange by 7 percent to $99.80 per bar.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 per bar.
Over the past two weeks, commodities markets have been threatened by financial anxiety on Wall Street, as well as double-powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching the maximum of $145.29 per barley in July, prices fell earlier this month almost to $90 per barley, and again jumped on the wave of huge uncertainty of the financial markets.
Anxiety rediscovered investors on Monday, even after Congress’s president announced that the weekend had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report has been shaken by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from the end.
In the latest episode of the breakdown, the government announced that the Citigroup group purchases a banking department of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg government partially destroyed the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts from Barclays Capital said the end-of-week negotiations that led to a plan for a rescue of the economy “represent themselves as unable to revive the mood of the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to decrease.
"Observations for global stock markets, interest rates and currencies have greatly destroyed," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that goods will not be able to escape infections.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is to the extent that the American virus will spread around the world and especially to China."
Analysts of this bank restricted their expectations for next year, as oil consumption fell due to slower growth in the economy, and lowered their gasoline prices for 2009 by about 20 %.
Wild ride in the second quarter has overcome the team’s record
After spending in Jets for the last eight seasons more than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which Jets turned the free game into a spine ride.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals were matching their defeated game with poshmoor clouds over themselves.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Colese to a 12-year-old touchdown sprint, perfectly subscribed to it in the afternoon, in which their progressive cooperation moved ahead by miles.
Favre sent Colese in the neighborhood behind the other two touchdowns, including the one in which he fell cornerback, and another 10 seconds before half the match.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre told Coles about all his recordings.
"He's a fucking good player.
It was a good communication to us, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were married, the defense attacked quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warne.
Cornerback Darelle Revis captured a blurred watch and returned him to touchdown by 32 yards.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another recording and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens gave Warnera to smoke.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, may have been the best.
The Cardinals team reached the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely scored a 20-year-old goal from the field, which led 34-0.
That's the most you ever got in one neighbourhood.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe that madness, said, "A second quarter or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without a response - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than that third.
A lot of points fell in a short period of time."
Renounced Gebreselassie improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia re-electioned why many people consider him the best remote racing ever when he overcame his own world record on Sunday in the Berlin marathon and became the first person to run a 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
Winning on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 overturned his previous time at 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, a 35-year-old, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has overcome the world record or is at least the world champion at all distances from a meter miles to a marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie left the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he feared - from a back-end perspective perhaps too frightened - that the polluted air would irritate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he promised he would run to Berlin.
In nearly perfect conditions - sunset and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the target - he won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a flashing average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As trail runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on a longer trail, the marathon record fell in the past decade by more than two minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won at 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had two weeks ago crashes in the pit and left a week of training.
The stop obviously stirred him up rather than stopped.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a bit of doubt today, but it was all right."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia - because he said he was overwhelmingly planning his race, generally avoiding world marathon tops, relying on guides as if it were a race on the road, and building world records over the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running quality.
Keeped at a rate of four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached half at 1:02:04.
After the drivers disappeared, Gebreselassie was constantly driven by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
About a little more than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie, he last took away and fled to Kwambai, who then ran to the second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended third at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, the excellent year ended with the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitěnková, a cousin from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
The record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
The sixty-year-old Mikiten was surprised to win last spring at the London marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games left because of something described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and the third marathon that she ever runs, improving her personal maximum for almost five minutes.
She ran smartly and thoughtfully: let four Ethiopian and Kenya runners run into a big jump and then reached it about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second at 2:21:31 and Helena Kipro from Keni ended third at 2:25:01.
Horror and obstacles to the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the spacious fun parks of Orland’s larger, a few miles from all the bright, noisy and vibrant, is a quiet city in which it enjoys the pride and demand of African-American life.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent his childhood, is no longer as simple as she described in 1935: "City of five lakes, three crochets, three hundred brown leathers, three hundred good swimmers, enough coffee and two schools."
Now it's a passionate place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual eatonvill festival Zora! to present the gift of Hurston, the most famous female writers of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, although it made a stop for tourists by incorporating it into the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
He is still so independent, dignified and private, as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that the countryside blackmen in Florida often dismissed and shared their real feelings with a white man who "we know so little that he doesn't even know what it's about."
Even today, in the year when Montenegro’s presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for open discussions on races, many of the residents here remain cautious against foreign views.
“We pay great attention to how our story tells,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here since birth and is a member of the oldest farm in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both the historical model of the Black rise and the community of nearly 2400 people, where the poverty rate is doubled compared to the global average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shadowed example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes defeated, sometimes praised - that originated from American slavery.
It’s not surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about Eatonvill's idea really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurston says here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through hearty books full of narratives such as "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (Their Eyes Watched God)" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida Tourist Guide transformed the city close to road 17, which leads through the frequently mixed center of Florida, to the stage of Black History and Human Drama.
With the racing of the big bubble in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of first Eatnonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"Beside the road," she wrote, "a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained palaces and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he cannot read or write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of beverages and anything that fits the hourly hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville was linked to the self-government, but also with uncertainty, re-enclosing marriages and sex.
This obviously wasn't Fodor's typical charging.
It wasn’t a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, a ninety-year-old, one of Johnson's daughters, who made Hurston immortal by citing men singing the right songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
She still remembers Hurston as a Cypriot center, who often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Augustus Franklin, seventy-year-old, recalls that when she arrived in the city, she smoked and weared pants in the city, which is proud of the dignity of clothes, and that she was not noticed in the huge Chevrolet.
The majority of the people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were excited.
"People of Zor have always been glad to see them," Franklin said.
But, he added, heaps on the back terrace seat with views of the lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
He seemed to have forgotten Eatonville with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black girl at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unlabelled grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonvill, there were no major shameful ceremonies or large public readings.
"I think they didn't understand her significance for the world or her link at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's lifespan "Wrapped in Rainbows" released in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s and 20s.
Orange County representatives wanted to cross the city five-stage roads instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-stage main road.
Orland’s devastation has already pushed the inter-state road No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still received from a complex historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for the mixing of races of hatred brought to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
“We actually had one lady who killed it.
They went out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the demand of the Supreme Court for forced integration, and for his decision in Brown’s case against the Education Chamber, she stated that “it is more offensive for my race than celebrating.”
The residents now argue that the desegregation of schools, although it was positive in some areas, has reduced coherence in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"The Black children were accustomed to gathering - I remember - in the morning, you took care of your teacher, you took care of your teacher at night," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins, and CEO of the Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville Community).
It lasted until the teachers and the disciples came from the same place, added.
"You don't care about your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," Nathiri said.
However, civil rights helped create space for many other Zory Neale Hurston - Black writers, actors and artists who rose up over prejudice like her with light self-confidence and quotes such as "How can someone influence the pleasure of my presence!
I won't understand that."
In 1975, Alice Walker visited Hurston's unlabelled tomb and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, he came to police in the bookbooks by Robert E. Hemenway's praised Hurston's biography, who re-incorporated it into the American cannon.
The road project arrived at the moment when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found the light ramp.
The former neighbours of Hurston were now considered to be a rescue.
In order to show what could happen to destroy its route, the community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and many return to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the state resigned from the road design.
"These five highway streams have risen up, you would say that it burned directly, a real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it simpler: "The zora saved Eatonville."
Winning over the road project helped change the image of the city.
Outside towns like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to go to the church here in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and the inhabitants began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new single-father library, of course named after Hurston, was opened in 2006 for a re-visfalted and broken Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from the center of Orland may sometimes act as a falling street in the summer rain, as small as it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Now it is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come to look for the story and the significance of Eatonville, it is still often treated carefully.
The permission for most interviews is necessary to have in advance and certain things - such as wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church, painted by whites and displaying blacks on the fields - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonvill, such as Jones, a brave, self-confidence teacher who likes red networks, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as Hurston’s festival has grown, home pride has also increased.
Especially young people are attracted to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, laboring, compassionate and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
Franklin's son, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, sounds sincerely love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or police, which says he would enjoy some help.
And even younger, such as the eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"When most people just go through here, they think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others," said Alondra Kenon recently after the church.
"But when you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we all speak financially.
Nothing changed here at first glance.
If the tourists in Manhattan were staying away from newspaper stains and curved TV screens on the Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never agree that in the glowing bees role of offices over their heads, bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The wheelchairs are still racing with metal cars across the hills and transfer muffins to breakfast meetings.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, fifty-sized shirts hanging from the shirts on their backs.
Office cruises are still waiting in front of their morning bagel at street dining stations, and it is still impossible to get the yellow taxi on the daily day between the fourth and the seventh afternoon.
It didn’t seem like a crisis until I, with all talks about pessimism, decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had timed this task to cover with my late afternoon sister at my local branch JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people were waiting in front.
Not before the cash windows to pick up or deposit cash, but before the overhead, where elderly customers order checkbooks, tourists ask themselves on a way to shop with mixed goods Macy's and new customers create accounts.
Most people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my licensed personal banker, came for the same reason as I.
However, compared to me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places from where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from the so-called thrifts (a little similar to building-savings), monetary associations and the types of savings, whose branches operate only in one state, and who claim to take care of their customers as family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have shortened their silence.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, moved to bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers returned home for the weekend Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, tried to catch a rescue buyer with assets of $440 billion.
Office employees and shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse, moved their cash into a bank that is perceived as a safe port and makes most of the rescue at Wall Street.
The usual New Yorkers have learned financially over the past week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket talked to Lehman Borthers, the short-lived bank, and to her lost senior executive worker Dick Fuld, with such a familiarity as if she was talking about a line-up colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed home for about fifty years, changed the theme of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food supplies.
After visiting the bank, she said to me, "I now have my savings in the cash market funds.
I've moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
Muslim tombs demolished after Austria's right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the Austrian right side of Freedoms and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right side of Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration that presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to the organization "City Against Islamization".
They wear cedules similar to transport marks that show the mosquitoes overwhelmed with a red line.
Police accuse the right-wing extremists of the desolation of the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that the extremely right-wing parties achieved enormous profits in general elections.
Over 90 tombs at a cemetery in Traun near Linze were sometimes severely destroyed between Friday evening and this morning, and the police were convinced that it was an organized event.
The blameless ones have overthrown Jewish symbols on some tombs such as David’s star, but detectives are convinced that this could be a attempt to strike the motives of extremists led by hate to Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident was anyway linked to the election.
The spokesman of the Islamic community here said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of destruction coming at the moment when the Muslim post month is nearing the end of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria enters the wheel of searching for its own soul after the road to the right side of the last parliamentary elections.
Both extreme-right sides, which have won more than 30 percent of the votes together, the Free Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have led vehemently anti-immigration campaigns, and some of their slogans have been criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the votes, protested against shakes and burks in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods in which a relationship with Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke about the "European Brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to prohibit the construction of meshes and minarets, arguing that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections that have put extreme right to the position of the strongest political block in the country indicate that this change has been caused mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel across the border
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star, who was convicted of child sexual abuse, bans the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials introduced this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that they plan to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police had been dismissed last Thursday after giving officials evidence of Glitter's previous sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, my own name, Paul Gadd, did not participate in the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
"On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police asked Ashford's lowest criminal court for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the borders between France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not participate personally."
64-year-old Glitter told the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, how he stored a record in the registry of sexual assaults.
He must inform the authorities if they want to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also pass the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If the obligation to inform the authorities has declined, it may be sentenced to five years.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible roads through the district.
The Kent police spokeswoman said: “The Kent police will do everything they need to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who will stay in the UK because we have extensive systems that manage potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent’s population is the highest priority for Kent police and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual assaults to minimize any risks for the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnam prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he fled to Bangkok, where he had to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel good, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass control and finally fly to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials continued his return to the UK.
On August 22, he finally arrived at the Heathrow 3 terminal and stayed there while his advocate David Corker went to the lowest criminal court in Western London, while at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order to register him as a sexual assault.
Glitter was in prison four months ago in the UK for child pornography.
The source from the Ministry of the Interior said Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was calm and pleased that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"Abich captured the real character, photographing the master beyond the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No shoes, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, dismissed from focusing on interpretation - only so I achieve a relaxed expression of man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
Secondly, man.
Indecisive, if we forget privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, a depth of a fly captured view or a passionate gesture of hands that are inconvenient because they do not want to go to the scene.
German Günther Bauer shifts theatre performance in "Flamenco-people" with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less known master faces.
With this purpose, a photographer composes a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place under the Moon Photography of Flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the increasing international significance of Flamenca," says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photo, you will find that these are not typical images with the art.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of bringing on the scene passion, sadness, joy... and totally capture the spectators.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to photograph on the scene.
He has his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giant.
Enjoyed by the festival "Cante de las Minas" Bauer began a long journey of portraiting flamenc singers, guitarists and dancers to the desk camera in 1997.
These are portraits that, thanks to the selection of the camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The use of different stylistic means is in contradiction with the classical foundation of the image and provides him with the contemporary spirit, which is the idea, according to Bauer himself, mirrors the flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but it does not cease to surprise and develop."
What strikes audiences is not the effect of a dance, singing, or playing, but the character and personality of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experience, was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the El Photomat Gallery.
This selection of nearly 70 photographed artists are composed of famous flamenco characters, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an antology of flamenco and will soon come up with a book edition that will contain the exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer’s portrait has led to the idea of repeating the "sport veterans portals" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", a photographer admits that "photoing people, knowing them, and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
A person meets or confronts people, personalities that sometimes they don’t know, or gives him only a few minutes to photograph.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery in street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedou de Hércules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that a novel that writes is "troubleness"
It is happening in an environment that is still unknown and tells about events for him unknown, although Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - just working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled even in Amazon.
An everlasting Nobel Prize for Literature, yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, confessed that the project that just hired him was "a triviality," and that "everything proves that I should not write this novel."
“If I had a mind, I wouldn’t do it, but I’d do it once and I believe that I’ll finish it,” he concluded his post on the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he saw in the aquaduct in the city in four days around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others.
The author of the novel "City and dogs" was one of the main characters of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of the Hay Festival for the most popular writer - Dickens' old edition "Our mutual friend" - filled theatre Juan Bravo to the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had a consecrated audience in front of him, and a hour of time running as water - a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and notable dose of humor reminded him of the foundation of him from the original "incredible adventure" of the image of Victor from the temperament of the passionate reader, and the discipline of the temperament of Alex, and the temperament of "the temperament of the life" of the temper.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, a breathtaking experience" - emphasized Vargas Lloss by emphasising his choice of "speaking on people" and "speaking" and "forcing them out."
Due to climate, the celebration in Pozoblancu is lost - missing copies
The exhibit with copies, which closes the celebration in Pozoblanca, was cancelled yesterday morning after the notification confirmed that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
The company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Paul Hermosou de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the matches.
The unfavorable weather conditions of this celebration suck for a long time, two out of three celebrations couldn’t take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of other planned beef matches.
During their formation, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista had to build beasts in the arena of Castilblanco.
This was celebrated only on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and awarded a dynamic and aesthetic performance was thrown on his shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two wounds for greeting and one ear that brought him rather uncovered seats in the arena than toreador art.
Another worse was El Juli, who passed through the poultry arena of Los Llanos, who was not sent into the house.
In the second wheel, without a single breath, he earned an acute criticism from most of his obesity.
They captured controls in Alawa in a supply of 2,000 pounds of hashish
In ten minutes five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the urban district of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop two people driving in the truck and they deceive them.
The cost, more than two tons of hashish, is not to stop.
According to a report from the Committee on the Interior of the Basque Government, the nationals were persecuted and detained by one of the persons traveling in the supply, a 38-year-old man identified as A. A. J.
He was detained for drug miscarriage and fake documentation.
The incident occurred when several passengers of the Transportation Unit conducted road checks on the N-1 in places crossing the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They tried to stop the supply for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, he fastened and caught.
The members of the car began to strike immediately when the vehicle stopped at the edge of a few kilometers away, at the moment both passengers jumped and fled to the forestry.
The Ertzaintzy members finally reached one of them and spent 2 178 kilograms of hashish, which was suspected to transport, as it appeared when checking out the delivery of Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and weight of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the recognition brand was "small" and disagreed with the data contained in the delivery documents, hence he was also accused of falsification of state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape in order to ultimately determine the origin of the drugs involved.
A 28-year-old A. A. J. was transferred to the police department to determine the appropriate formalities before he joined another investigation later.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for a ride under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her carrying out unusual manner when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, told People, California's spokesman.
Locklear said that at about 16.30 p.m. "the fool went to the gas, walked ahead and back and tried to get out of the parking lot - while covering several times she crossed the sunglasses".
The Witness, who did not first recognize the actress, saw Locklear a moment after stopping on a nearby road and leaving the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "he was afraid of Locklear's life."
When the police guard arrived in the place, he found an actor inside the vehicle, which partly blocked the truck.
"She looked disoriented," and therefore her relatives took her to a specialized drug and alcoholic center to undergo the test.
According to the police spokesman, the actress worked together and the excessive amount of alcohol was excluded, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was visible to the guards at first glance."
Locklear was arrested for suspicion of conduct under the effects of the nearer non-specific substance and was arrested about 19.00, although a few hours later she was released.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from the treatment clinic, where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU to exercise its powers in the case of Silva
General Chief of the IU and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former Council of Youth and Sports Council in Seville, Francisca Manuela Silva, who left the office last week after being accused of negotiating in favor of his family, will be inviting to the country.
"I am too federalist to do so, it is to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," said Llamazares in a negotiation to which the party will have to move in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, IU chief insisted that in the case of the investigation of the illegal negotiations Silva conducted, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU always struggled to ensure that such matters are maximum transparent."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict ethical code for all public functions".
"May blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garciho's epical betting
José Luis Garci in the "May Blood" (Sangre de Mayo), inspired by the national episodes of Benita Pérez Galdós, revives the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about €15 million.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "design the expression of characters and analysis of the company", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarría during the presentation of the image before a vast team of interpreters.
May’s blood with a subway over two and a half hours will be introduced to the film on Friday and a more than four-hour television series will be scheduled for Telemadrid in the future.
As a great fan of Galdós’ literary work, José Luis Garci claims that he fulfilled the "child dream" by recording this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who gave him three years ago to record the picture to the second anniversary of Madrid on May 2, he will receive the offer from the Episode that he would
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madri has fully contributed, means for Garcia to create a "unique opportunity" environment with cults and costumes corresponding to the image of "thirds of Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for whom it was possible to fight - the struggle for independence, led by the government of Ferdinand VII.
The director, however, regrets that he could not count on the financial support that came to the films of the Stressed Wing (Ala triste) or Goy's scenes - almost twice the May Blood - so he could not record some of the scenes of the script signed at the same time by Horacím Valcárcelem, who worked with his entire film.
The film's director "Start Again" (Volver and Start) works as usual - on the scene with the actors he usually tries before filming and does not choose a casting, because it looks like "humble" and is also believed to be a part of the career, a part of the film's career, and a part of the film's career is going in, among other things.
Many actors who have chosen for May’s blood appear before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations to Oskara, one of which has won, is the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven tables of the French billiar and the last chosen Blind Sunsets, represents the film of the youth of the Spaniard.
Garcia does not expect any awards for this movie.
“At first, you think you’re working for what’s going to happen, but then you realize that you’re only working for a salary, and then you’re going to make another movie more,” Garci, a 30-year-old director career, explains.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual connection of the Séville dancer Tórtola Valencia
Seville Dancer Flamenca will give up another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanka (Georgia Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district, and when she was three years old, she moved with her family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on eastern dance.
She experienced a life full of passion, she was a pioneer female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the cancellation of the corset, which allowed women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of inter-war Europe, taught Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pew Gamboa and she proposed this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
"It's not about the story of her life, but about the capture of the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythm of flamenco.
So, I've got a "tanc motil" evocated Guajira or "tanc hada" some tang.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetics would also match,” she said.
The presentation is counted with the involvement of two exceptional characters: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in the "Open Doors" (La puerta open), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with her ex-girlfriend.
"Matilde represents the older Tortollo, a mature character.
I’m happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it’s a great honour for me.”
In the presentation she also counts with the music and guitars of Jesúse Torrese and Paca Arriagy, with the singers of Miguela Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the bubs of El Pájara, the violet Rafa El Violy and the collaboration of actress Juanfri Juárez, "which has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artists who are always in their hands."
It also takes into account the life of this woman who took place for her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as all over Europe, because she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge impact at some point, but no one knows her today and then even less appreciates her formation,” Bayón said.
The presentation begins today at 20:30 at Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The book "Freely Married Day" also closes the trienal
Introduction of the first illustrated edition "The Daily of the Fresh Married" in St. Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobi in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Nobel Prize Awards for the Year of the Annual Annual Government for the celebration of "The Trinity of the Year" with Ramoby and Juana.
"The Trial of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" is going to end with the new release of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the exhibit "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sun's Radiation" which was opened in May of this year, will have a plan to come across in the New York City, and after the various congress
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered eight hundred copies of "The Daily of the Freshly Married" edited by Pedr Taberner and illustrious by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and the work of one of the world's Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn’t like it anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "without a bad intention" and under a quiet consciousness that Newman left, reveals his unpleasant vision of abandoned American cinematography and across America.
Look how long it took them before he got Oskara.
He has been retired since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
But it was for all the boys.
“Sometimes what a person feels can’t be expressed in any way, and I’ve lost a great friend now,” Robert Redford said in tears, “my life and my country were better thanks to it.”
No one was afraid he would be ridiculous or overwhelming.
The father of the film and country died in a particularly dark time of terror and financial markets, in a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom when they are desperate looking for reasons for pride.
When the time is sharp and people without dignity and just a bunch of those worthy of admiration - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, it was almost the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and the fighter for lost and winning cases, from the drug addiction foundation based on the honour of his firstborn son who died of overdose to his own home food and bio-food brand.
A full treasure for the country, which cost a lot of efforts to forgive the suicide culture.
The storm wave admired Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he died not one man, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, the owner of Oskara under directed by Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was the top of his career.
The evil guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has become Newman's greatest source of inspiration.
"This sheet has planted us all very high," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who now have the courage to try to live as Paul Newman - based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always light in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their pattern.
He divorced once, and since then he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was loyal, although he had more than enough chances to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he laughed.
Let him in heaven be proud of the fact that there is a conspiracy between his daughters and admirers on earth - in America it is not too common.
It is said that “from all the big roles he has made, he was the worst in the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a sacrificed filantropa.”
Incomplete Olympics in Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask myself: Are we ready?
If we're going to run the race yesterday, I'm saying, no!
He was talking about a perfect race, and, according to my judgment, he was the worst in which I had ever been.
Such a senseless dream that if an evaluation occurred and I was testing, it would be obviously insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty one after the other.
The senses start by picking up the race number, for which a person must go out earlier.
It doesn’t seem bad to me, but when someone goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip that’s supposed to avoid overfill the paths).
No, no, no.
Here the person had to first take the number (the first meaning, just for that reason) and (what surprise!) they had only a S size shirt (the second meaning, because I need XL size).
Where are we living?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only a small shirt because it’s less substances and are cheaper?
Well, that's a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having had to go very early for the chip and the front took him for more than 15 minutes, he had to give his bag there.
It took over 35 minutes to wait, which is at the race, where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as it was expected, the race started, and we haven't put our bags yet, and when it was already done, it was much worse with the extraction.
Waiting further extended by 40 minutes of rain, resulting in general uprising and assault on the cabin.
I believe 500 of us will have an inflammatory inflammation tomorrow, and some, like me, will not appear the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip that they gave me and which I guess didn't record the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me for a perfect race, this wouldn't hit me.
And so I think we'll have to make a well-prepared Olympic city just look like it.
Microsoft is looking for reception (virtual)
At the MIT conference on new technologies, Microsoft introduced further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in a way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a message that would move around the whole of the company) and see what they hear in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receiving" can find out how many people are in the room who are - even remembering what they have on themselves - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
They can also divide the present by conversation groups.
On the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that it is not part of the group that speaks with it and that it is not a company employee.
She asks her if she's going after someone, and she tells her that she's going to be devoted to her in a moment.
It's all without a blue screen of death.
Amazing.
But of course it is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to work, for example a new version of Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk about the change of Microsoft strategy this week.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial unnecessity, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as a game when we consider that Microsoft's version adds a new feature to Windows and another "extra".
A change in direction would be a merit.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing significance and similar software is on it.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who appealed to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many legitimately indicated that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something dishes.
That's the truth.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as the absolute truth, but as the relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, to more Internet browsers.
The computer is switched off to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the internet every day than around the window.
What is half of the applications that are connected to the system?
Less is more.
Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
I hope they need it, and I have a little example here.
I made this photo in one resting place for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a postcard on the beverage machine that asked them to use their search engines: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft’s employees used Google to search on the Internet.
Last week, however, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computer.
Because Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for delays.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso weared it on the Azur coast, Leonardo di Caprio lighted in one in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppoly's "Cmotro" and is part of the uniform of the muscle gay community.
And if we want to take a look at his life roles, we can get to the picture of a typical muscle with a top-notch neck that raises the bulbs in the cat circle.
Essentially, it is nothing more than typical cotton men's underwear, fit and without gloves.
The English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels is excited over all the others.
First of all, even if people call him 'Marcel', which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, he was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the singer's lover Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' covers other quality cotton, unisex string, distinctive label and (almost unrecognized) Belgian flagship, which has models of non-emblematic styles such as detail on the neck.
And be careful because the Belgian company is not only specializing in tank tops.
It also produces mikiny college, retro boxers, casselor shirts, cotton shirts, sea shirts, children's clothing, mini shorts...
Thinking pieces for a comfortable underwear.
Although it is unfortunate to be just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Whoever is a father doesn't care."
A huge image of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, although small characters, is a woman full of life.
Their new fashion actions are now taking Cruz's sisters very seriously.
For Monique, it means much more than just that some beautiful, famous girls borrow their name.
In Paris, a promotional event organized by Mango in its new headquarters has also been involved in the announcement of the most significant fashion prizes sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's hearty and unmarried, and she's close to you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection that Penelope’s sister and I proposed for Mango for this autumn-hiver season, and at the same time I took part in the announcement of the second anniversary of "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine.
It was a challenging day, but also an exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you’re working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love the films of the 1950s and 60s, and we have pumped a lot of incentives from them.
I also like to wish around the city and watch women walking dressed, mixing and laying their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, but in the end everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I probably liked her clothes, I still wanted to go to grandmother, to walk in her grandmother's cabinets and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on the road.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
However, you know that we dancers are based on how we are adjusting to feel good at our hours and tests when looking into the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you'll actually penetrate the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've been 30 recently, was there a crisis on you?
Kdepak.
I feel better than ever before, thirty have fun.
I find that a woman is already ready, has experience and enjoys life with less mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
I'm doing what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I will be a mother because my body asks for it, and besides I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
When it comes to my father, I don't worry about that.
But I know one thing, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
When it comes to the movie, you are now waiting for a few premiers of the movies you recorded last year.
That's what I'm looking forward to when they come to the movies.
I am from the theatre world, and so I am very impatient and quiet, I want everything right now, and of course it doesn't.
I am looking forward to the premiere "The last minute" and "In search of the tomb of Christ".
Overall, how will you like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the overseas mould on the side of Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'd go to the moon as a model.
Just called me Naomi Campbell, whom I know for a long time, and invited me to London to take part in the beneficial overviews for her organization "Women for a better life", and the clothes we presented - I also chose two models from our Mango collection -, was excited and the gain was not given to this organization.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
In addition, I will keep the good thing in which he is engaged.
She asked me to present it for charity purposes, but if she asked me to make a stand, I would do it too.
For the benefit of women in the third world, I will do what I need.
Drivers repeatedly landing with alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Interior Ministry requires a driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol to install a system in his car that prevents him from starting a car in a drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal has been introduced in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Higher State Representative, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return the drivers for the wheel, so the drivers will also have to complete the transport over-education course.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Office, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the FITSA Foundation will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of the drivers accused of driving drunk again in this state will be a wheelchair.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the permitted alcohol concentration.
Its price exceeds €1,000 and it must be paid by the winemaker himself.
In 2007, a study in the United States carried out in this sense has shown that over the first year since its introduction, the infringements have been reduced by 65% for vehicles equipped with these devices.
In Spain, it is calculated that it could save 115 lives every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it proceeds in a criminal offence.
And in order to help its introduction, as the legal adjustment can be carried out in a normal way, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The equipment is not yet available in any sales version in the Spanish market, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
Tomorrow the Congress of Members will vote on the proposal for the PSOE (Spanish Labour Socialist Party) in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 p.m., as it stood in the program, a Spanish Air Force aircraft landing at the Benita Juáreza Presidency hanger at the airport in Mexico D. F., where the prince and princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun just came down, but its radiations had to climb their eyes so that it could be seen a pair of followers coming out of the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials were under the shoes.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver if he knew the Spanish prince and the princess would come to visit the state.
Yeah, that's great, it's not going to get to the airport at that time... she's out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's a Spanish, but she lived there for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
However, the Mexican press knows who the princess and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hanger at the airport close to the Red Cover and a military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to shoot a honorable salt.
The Prince appears with a smile on his lips in the dress of dark blue color and a princess, very swallowed and with pink hair, does not have his usual "peeptoes", apparently stated that in D. F. a storm is threatening.
Before they go to the hall where official delegations are waiting, they smile on photographers and don’t have to put them in.
At the doors of the hotel, one of the four largest in the city, there is a Mexican television reporter waiting for them.
Best-subsidyed fashion price
It’s probably not a better place in the world to publish a fashion price than Paris and it’s probably not a better designer and bounty than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second anniversary of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation of new talents in the field of fashion.
The price is subsidised by EUR 300,000.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoliová, winner of the first year, looked at her proposals in the Manga exhibit on the Paris bulwarf Haussmann number 54 and almost wept.
Of course, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and has just been opened on a 1,335 square meter area.
The largest is located in London.
A lot of events together with the desire to thank the designers of Valentine for his appointment as the chairman of the Competition Board, resulted in the ultimate overthrow in the Paris Oper Garnier.
The Mango partyly decorated presidential table looked next to the most important Chagall works even more amazingly.
Nati, whose heart-breaking sorrow over the recent death of his brother, had no apparentity, wearing the clothes of this brand and the jewelry ELAH, on which he breathed, and hanged into his son Luise, a nearly two-meter elegant, accompanied Valentine in front of his table at his dinner for his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, welcomed and as a real gentleman, stayed with Baroness Rothschild without screws, as both offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store in - hand-designed - shirts and shirts, and for dinner, she turned into long black sexy dresses, she saw a night walk through the Opera accompanied by Goyi Toled, she showed us the ballet test hall, and at the remembrance of one time she was swimming.
Inés Sastre didn’t stand on the side buildings of the palace, but before she left, she showed us the pictures of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning, we could be surprised by the presence of Olivier Martinez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own clothes and towels and asked for no smells to be used in his rooms.
Stars under the Paris Star Sky.
Oh, that's life.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and devastating everyday life.
And so that not a little, they are all summarized in a book that on September 30 brings to the library of relaxation.
Wake up every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it’s even worse to imagine yourself in a successful rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods of fighting daily exhaustion and disturbance from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside the yoga position, classical massages and spa therapy on the websites of her book collected the entire "menu" options, adjusted according to the taste and time options of each individual.
The book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the charger Pearson Alhambra and DK brings peace to the library.
If someone thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "guide" rejects this view.
In addition, it offers additional procedures, such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer in your veins, which re-aging the balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on a couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Speech from sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don't think those who wake up and tell us something that happened a day before, but children who speak while sleeping.
When it happens for the first time, it may heal you, but in fact, it's irrelevant.
This is an innocuous sleep disorder called sleep.
It is very common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely no one of you told me that he was talking to sleep at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadicly (for example, once per life in high fever), or with greater regularity (each day, once a week, once a few months...), the other day the child does not remember anything.
There is only one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as night swelling, night swelling, night enuresis (night helping) or miscarriage, but it must not be so.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stress or stressed situations.
In any case, this is a little tested phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak calmly, say individual words, scream, or just the opposite (speaking, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where a child is manifested with a great force, it would be appropriate to observe and consult a specialist to find out if he has no problem that causes great anxiety and thus manifests himself.
We said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it joins another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is eaten with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this to remember a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to get too excited before you go to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous children and those with whom work can be relaxed, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that can help them get some inner calm.
This allows the child to sleep more calmly.
When dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and that the next day it will not remember anything from what happened.
Useful Tips
Don't be him.
It's unnecessary because it's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even though he speaks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember, if you seem to be very sad several times after you, it would be appropriate to talk about advice or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so usual), avoid the temptation to listen to him and draw information from him.
It will not be for nothing, because when he sleeps, he is not aware that he can arrange his thoughts.
Moreover, you hear what he says, but you don’t know what he looks like, and therefore why he says, so pay attention to how you interpret information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even funny.
This causes great anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s nothing wrong, it’s just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory after a long period of time.
Without having played a particularly big game, the yellowmen have created more opportunities and have managed to change one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast pace during this conflict, in which the attackers were hard to pursue.
After the first attempt of Captain Kauffmann, who shooted from a distance just about the wools of the past allies, began to have Illhaeusern slightly design and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemaria.
On the contrary, the opponent built a defensive wave in half of the playground and left only an axial Riahi on the tower of the attack.
The beginning of the second half appeared to be decisive, thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie named Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, for which Marais took care, well positioned for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, Gólman Illhaeusernu did not enjoy the joy for a long time, about twelve minutes later he was forced to return to the dress and leave his co-player in weakness.
But Dannemarie could not get out of it, and eleven of Illhaeusern, who just pulled a little to "beat" the defense, no longer caused any greater difficulties, except in the last seconds of the match, when the ball fled very close to the bridge after a great crash.
Sarkozy goes to angry fishermen
Before departing to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a trip to Bretagne.
In order to face a demonstration of the powers of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several British and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their leaders there.
The last names promised that it would be accepted "in a constructive spirit", and hoped that it would come with specific proposals.
The President's visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by the British fishermen in order to get measures against the sharp rise in oil prices, reaching an average of EUR 1.14 per liter.
According to the Elysean Palace spokesman David Martinon, "the president will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions for the employment and payment of seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be inaccessible to fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations of "small driving vehicles" in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km of crash.
The holiday port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections towards the Belle-île were not suspended.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, a filtration reserve was carried out.
The sailors demonstrated their commitment on Monday, when tires and palettes were burned in front of the ports in Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and la Manche channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where traulers remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of commercial vessels.
Fishers from Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique during the evening stopped the blockade of an important Total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for themselves to act on Wednesday at the ministry meeting.
In Guilvineco, the "crisis committee" will be decided on Tuesday on how to continue on the upcoming road, and on his participation in a prepared meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The state will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave" and "do not want to enter Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Fishers who do not pay oil taxes are currently paying about 50 cents per liter, but they judge that the vessel’s profitability threshold is achieved only if oil is below 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman's Grand Prix
An unforgettable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes worshipped the legend of the film and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
Brazilian aircraft manufacturers rely on supplying 215 aircraft this year, amid the threat of a recession over the world economy.
The world’s fourth airplane builder, Embraer, maintains its supply assumptions for 2008 with 215 supplied equipment, President Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder promises a lot from the Chinese market, particularly with a range of airplanes from 30 to 120 seats.
Embraer has added 41 equipment to Chinese customers within eight years.
AIG considers to increase 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have received over water, thinks to invest more than 15 percent of its assets in order to pay $85 billion to him as a deposit, according to the Financial Times Sunday issue.
AIG is ready to explore sales of most of its activities outside of life insurance on international fields and retirement activities in the United States, a newspaper citing sources close to current negotiations.
According to FT, AIG’s Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine the event.
AIG could not receive any confirmation statement.
Assets to which AIG intends to get rid of include its subsidiary of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in Transatlantic Holdings insurance insurance, as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, provides FT.
No final decisions have been adopted, FT continues.
AIG must quickly acquire cash in order to pay the 85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk that the U.S. authorities will deposit 80% of the capital to him, at the same time dividing it into the right ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House’s representatives rejected Paulson’s bank rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, which is an unseen loss nearing 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped from 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The greatest point breakdown in his history (from 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of renegotiation of trade after terrorist attacks on 11 September.
The Nasdaq Index with a dominant technological component lost, according to the final data after the closing of trading, 199.61 points and was at 1 983.73 points and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 Index decreased by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
Since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally failed after an unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan by the House representatives, a plan that would allow the market to be re-established.
228 votes against and 205 votes for representatives refused to give the Secretary of State money to Henry Paulson the funds he requested.
Two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market that sees that Congress is unable to adopt a certain plan," Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial, says.
"It shows how much the market has relyed on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted will not come "too late in a few days."
“If this project is actually condemned to destruction (...), the staffet will be immediately transferred to Fedeo (American Central Bank, known to the red.) and to other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of Global Insight economist.
And with the emphasis on the emergency situation, Piegza said in the United States "every new day brings the fall of a single financial institution".
After the Friday crash, Washington Mutual was organized by the authorities to purchase banking activities of the Wachovia bank by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly picked up turns and demanded immediate intervention to the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are “not only dealing with the American crisis, but with the world crisis,” a FTN Financial analyst said.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The revenue from the cash rate for 10 years fell to 3,632 % compared to 3,827 % on Friday evening, the revenue for 30 years to 4,161 % compared to 4,357 % on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House followed the second debate to find out who won the two John McCain and Barack Obama.
The tents of the campaign of Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when both of them expressed their victory in the television duel that watched a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, no matter how decent he was, was not “brilant” enough to allow him to stop five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in the survey.
The Gallup Institute, whose survey of public opinion published on Saturday imposes a five-point surplus to Obama (49 per cent against 44 per cent for McCain), judges that a Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Obama is a winner for 39% of the respondents, while, according to a CBS survey, 25 percent assigns McCain victory.
Obama should have the opportunity to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his co-candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would have been wrong to underestimate her.
"It's done," said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain constantly emphasized his unfair experience in the field of foreign policy, while emphasising the "naivity" of his competitor in matters that constituted the core of the first conflict.
"It seems that Senator Obama didn't understand that..." sounded repeated accusations.
“I don’t think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
In this assaulting spirit, they have gone from yesterday's Republican TV spots.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and showed himself short and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still hasn't understood while Obama did," he said on the weekend, a democratic spot that the Republican estimates that he doesn't get enough of the impact of the crisis on the "usual American".
"During this ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said before 20,000 people gathered at a election meeting in North Carolina with a rainfall.
Neither did he pronounce the words as "middle class" or "working". The financial breakthrough clearly favors Obama, which Americans consider to be more eligible to save the economy on the edge of the loss.
"The next week, a decisive return could be hit," the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton’s administration, compared Obama’s “economic transparency” to what Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidates of the Democrats, the present notion is "the ultimate dictatorship of eight-year bad economic policy, as George Bush operated it and as Senator McCain supported it."
The Senate of Illinois reaffirmed that, through Wall Street’s unexpected jumps, it should be able to reduce 95 per cent of Americans’ taxes, and also stressed that the implementation of the country’s potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is its priority number one, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to rebuild a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates were cautious about the $700 billion financial aid plan (470 billion euros), which was adopted by Congress last night and which was highly unpopular.
“What, have you noticed that some elections were held in Minsk?”
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of election rooms on the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although there haven’t been any results yet, many young people have come to protest against the regime of President Lukašenk: “Dictator, demission.”
Some confess that they did not go to the elections, saying, "What would happen if they do what they want to do with my voice?"
He does not believe that this regime, which was friendly to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including the prohibition of a visa for 40 Belarusian sexists and the freezing of certain assets, could be cancelled if elections are considered to be clean.
According to the opposition, that was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the number of votes," said Juri Potemkin, spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and the leading person of the European movement, "because it's important who counts the votes, and we have the power to do it.
If some opposition parliamentarians arrive in parliament, they will be appointed, not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space in television, meetings in regions and bills.”
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union must be launched.
If our economy, which is deeply in debt to Russia, is affected by the crisis and we are not reformed, we are threatening to become a protector of Russia.
We want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the course of elections, will not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that the participation seems too high and that the general introduction of premature votes (26 percent of voters in Minsk) opened the road to all possible manipulations.
"What, have you noticed that there were some elections?" said social-democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August.
“There was no leg in the elections.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in Parliament, those who are most suited to the regime."
The night's silence again grew up with the October Square.
On television, President Lukašenko and members of the Central Election Committee congratulate on success.
Interview - Blood that is sure again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its founding, and his President, Dr. Francine Décary, was legitimately pleased as Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the public's confidence that was seriously frightened after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 80s and 90s.
As it is generally known, the state blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated by the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Due to this drama and wave nevole to the public, the Canadian government initiated a public investigation in February 1994 to which Judge Horace Krever had to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to formulate recommendations to avoid repeating such aggression.
While Judge Krever took off with the report, some provinces introduced a committee to a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Québec, the Gélinea's committee established this role.
According to Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, who had to be charged with Québec, and the Canadian blood company for supply of all provinces and both territories.
“When Héma-Québec started his activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,” says Decary.
“The situation was calling.
We have re-acquired the public’s confidence over the next few years with the constant efforts to increase blood products’ safety and work in this area,” Hema-Québec said, and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 percent of the Quebec population had trusted him.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that “confidence is something very cruel.”
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
"Then we witnessed in Europe the incidence of many cases of human forms of insane cow disease, new variants of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," a woman whose founding in 1998 led the company.
“We didn’t know if this disease could spread with blood.
Therefore, we have argued on one of the basic recommendations of Krever and Gélineau's report, according to which, in the case of the spread of a serious disease, in this case, Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of the brain inevitablely leading to death, should be taken excluding measures.
In April 1999, we refused blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that keeping the principle of caution was meaningful.”
In 1999, a much more precise technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: Nuclear Acid Tests (NAT) allowing the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor blood, not the presence of antibodies on which tests were used before.
NAT tests have enabled you to shorten the dumb periods between the moment of the patient’s infection and the moment when our blood technicians can reveal the first viruses, the specialist explains.
We have been able to shorten this period for less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and without being able to come to it.
This improvement enabled significantly to reduce the risk of AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV is exposed to one in 12 million people today.
“In other words, this means that before someone gets infected with HIV, you will need to distribute 12 million blood products.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission through the blood product occurs.
I think today we can get totally calm or prescribe blood transfusions needed to be healed," Hema-Québec head of leadership said.
“The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what a disease fertility element can appear in the system.
Just last year, a virus of chikungunya appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the virus of the Western Nile, transfers into the blood of the poison.
It is necessary to be constantly careful,” Dr. Décary continues, stressing that besides safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
“The needs are growing because the population is ageing.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or blood platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which consists on average of only 3% of Quebec donors."
Every healthy person aged at least 18 years of age, which meets the admissibility criteria, but can only give blood once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people offering blood are not accepted, for example, because they are wearers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited the country where the winter is organized, they are excluded for one year.
“With these 3% we can maintain a condition that corresponds to the needs of hospitals.
The shortcomings are very rare.
However, donor network members should be complemented proportionally to how they are old and can’t give blood anymore.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially then to keep them and encourage them to become regular gifts.
Life is so uncomfortable today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec delivers not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart disease, eye bulbs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank from the puppies in Québec.
The puppies, previously considered biomedical waste, are flooded with blood-rich stem cells that can serve in the treatment of serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood sample from the puppies in the bank and we assume we will take them over a thousand years.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the puppy snorkeling as a very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have enough funds to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Québec.
Football - Impact in the semi-final
Impact Montréal was qualified yesterday at Saputo during the second and at the same time in the decisive quarterfinal match played on the total number of brackets in the semifinal wheel of the USL first division, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sounders from Seattlu.
Antonio Ribeiro gave a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After both sides, the first half of the homeless, the backpackers David Testo and Rocco Plancentino have introduced the remaining two goals of Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to consult with Matt Jordan in favour of Sounders.
Remember that on Friday, during the first of the two quarterfinals, Impact suffered at Starfire Complex in Tukwile at the Seattl defeat of 2:1.
Impact will be in the semi-final of its strength with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening in Minnnesota, Thunder matched the home deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, but Whitecaps still put into the semi-final wheel with a total number of 5:4.
Impact should be confronted with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of a series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Kortce - Kovalev's winner goal
The first three Canadian attackers are ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tomache Plekance and Andreje Kosticina at Centre Bell last night encouraged a Canadian 3:2 victory attack on separate matches.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the collision, shot a goal, Plekanec gathered two assistants, and Kovalev climbed one of the three-colored matches in this fourth victory.
Kovalev secured the victory by putting a single goal during separate races.
"I'm not ready yet," he said.
“I need another match to make me feel good.”
"In the first third he tried to handle it too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice potato."
Charest bets in the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the early elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the Liberal Party (Parti Liberal) meeting, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Québec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is nominated in today’s supplementary elections.
"Removing the borders of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually emphasizing way at the conclusion of the Québec Liberal Party's meeting in Lewis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were thrown behind him in some pictures.
On the three rounded plates, a slide runs with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric fences, down, Québec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great funds, similar to those in the election period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would call for early elections in the autumn, although he noted that he had a very loaded program.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth dimension of the "Visa", which the Prime Minister plans for Québec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontari.
Despite the fact that the opening of North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements, it has never been subject to presentation.
However, the prime minister has limited himself to explaining why North represents a "big potential" but has not set a deadline, a sum of investments, or a clear priority in future projects.
It mentioned above several approaches to points that could be further divided: in particular water plants, forests, but mostly the sector, encouraged by the growth of developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's calculation, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, plate, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice as much as France is with us" is in Québec.
And it's not just with us, it's with us," he emphasized as he wants to show that a certain national founding myth is called.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, he raised the Prime Minister: the hunting for gold in Abitiba, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after theatrely quiet to look at a huge map behind his back.
Northern Québec, 70% of the territory of Québec, includes a part of the Labrador, which Québec has always requested, has been declared by the Prime Minister during a press conference.
“This is a traditional attitude that has repeated all the governments to date.
There is one line of borders that has long been lacking the convention, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
Otherwise, “it is also necessary to re-examine our vision of the North,” he said when he spoke of the transition to the north-west, which, as a result of ice dances, opens throughout the year.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking the territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous nations and the Inuite?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very careful for them and that the project would be beneficial, especially young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-pequist member of Ungavy), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The activity was initiated by the Interministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) is an important position.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be exhausted".
North development should, however, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "together designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a gasoline in the vision of the Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded him.
Like the liberals who preceded us, we changed our thoughts to transform the challenges into a new opportunity for growth and development.
This is one of the still terrified themes of the weekend, which was launched by a big cocktail on Friday on the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross the Beauharnois centre to the Adelard-Godbout's resignation.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and the Nationalization of Water Power, until after Bourass, who created James's Gulf, our side was able to create a future," Jean Charest said.
He recalled on the press conference for another authority, this time conservative, and John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a series arrived at Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest emphasized that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying that between us, but I'm planning to be there," he trusted his member base, provoking a significant potles.
The same Prime Minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not even in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of elections in the fall of this year, allowing him the law.
However, he stressed that his program was charged, particularly the missions of the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekend meeting provided the heads of the platform’s liberals for some nationalist resolutions, in particular a certain “tests to change the Constitution” which have passed very smoothly: the PLQ (The Liberal Party of Québec) requires particular recognition of the “Quebec specificity” in the Constitution.
He also wishes Québec to appoint some of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Council, which should be entitled to veto in the case of decisions taken in Québec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was adopted skeptically in its main characteristics.
Pauline Marois, PQ Chief (Parti Québecois) re-released the Northern Québec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to her, when the government of the Liberals came to power in 2003, she rejected the filling of this policy.
If she had followed her, "we would be still today," Marois noted by her candidate at Jean-Talon (which the elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we agree that this is not just a theatre," said Sébastien Proulx, a representative of Maria Dumonta, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Disastered countries
It was Vic Toews, former minister of justice (irony) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour in the summer of last year that he represented Canada's "hanbu".
This is how to crash a woman who has led an undeniable struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, that tells many about the prime minister’s surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government in front of us that, as one of all the participating Western countries, did not return to the territory of its citizen closed in the concentration camp of Guantánamo.
The government, which does not take into account that at the time of the deeds he had to be taken away, was Omar Khadr a young adolescent.
The only government that, although Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has signed its word and has left a child soldier's inhuman condition.
The only one who relies on the parodi of justice to judge the accused’s guilt.
Remind us that UNICEF, the Amnesty International, and in particular the Association of Canadian Lawyers, are defending the repatriation of Omara Khadra in order to be able to wait for a fair process in Canada.
The government also closes its eyes before torture: it’s hardly important for her that this young man has been psychologically destroyed, and that certainly lasts, after so many years of tremor.
We don’t know this, but we are witnesses of the blatant erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy,” the words that Harper has so much deluded and that sounds so empty from his mouth.
There is a time when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him wrongly, to imprison him according to the Libyan head of the minority government until now (as will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a side that proclaims Honor, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has rejected what made the reputation and weight of our country.
Hanba, Mr. Toews, is in this resignation, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell Discurs by Barrick Gold
In the edition of September 17, Le Devoir printed the letter of Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice-President of the Canadian Cabinet of Barrick Gold.
With Orwell’s logic, the world’s largest gold producer has launched a search for three authors and a poor little loadload for injury to honor in order to create a “transparent public debate” and require six million.
If the truth is that the judges are independent and impartial, they will not judge the truth, especially in the case of a complaint of insult to honour, but the law.
It’s not surprising that Garver completely mixes this essential solution.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to conduct a public debate, to bring to the table of anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whether the process happens, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectful amounts to be prepared to defend themselves and to fight in a very unbalanced fight against the Army of lawyers supported by nearly unsuccessful pockets of a firm.
The tactics in these unbalanced fears, however, often involve the destruction of the accused in order to prosecute a reconciliation procedure that will strike the mouth of the opposite side and, in addition, scare anyone who would dare to devote this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should present her view of the whole matter to the public.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada is a debate under normal circumstances in the exchange of thoughts, not in the wounds of obsession.
Therefore, important societies have only been enough to open their books, their documentation, and to make a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and financing independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold appears to have no confidence in public opinion, and he rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a "public debate" and at the same time reject the opinions of the same public?
It appears that this word in the Vice-President world only indicates toughly paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; it is quite solemn to the concept of this concept.
Democracy also has the right to talk to the Nazis.
Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – that the public that supports authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so, especially because he refuses the brutal ways of harassment of society.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and assess the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many people see as a complaint, in which they should be punished by the accused (in the context of their complaint "public debate" to use Canada's Noir's...
If we remember Garver's surreal speech, the initiation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom of worship and searching for truth that is essential for every democratic society.
In general, it rejects the right to quote reliable resources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual activity itself.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of this world without being exposed to repeated trials, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she obeyed the scientific standards that authors Noir Canada used.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment in which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s overwhelming complaint clearly shows that despite what they claim, it does not have a smaller taste of conducting a transparent debate.
For the university, it is a loss, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would restrict such a type of unlawful appeal.
Wall Street rescue operations - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush’s administration and Congress transfers, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the largest economic rescue plan from the big crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan to help the US$700 billion outbreak of the financial crisis, which has been slaughtered by Wall Street for months, has to be approved by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it assumes a better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the amounts of homes incurred for non-payment, and also the right to monitor the amounts paid by the leading employees rescued by companies.
U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, Chairman of House Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the office, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news last night a few minutes after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush's Officer Henry Paulson.
"It was done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe before the crisis just on Wall Street," the Democrat said.
“This is a critical point: unless we do this, the trauma, chaos, and the distortion of American daily life will be huge,” said Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, the negotiations have run to maximum turnovers from the fear of the effect, which would be a further failure to provide investors.
The time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. president were invited to negotiations later and both expressed themselves rather for the deal, but not expressing their satisfaction with the need to refer to such a extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed a complement of the agreement on some measures, particularly on the purpose of enabling owners to maintain residence, and measures on salary of state-leading workers rescued by companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures due to the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate them.
However, these measures are necessary,” he explained in the television waves.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I would like to see details, but I hope it is."
“The hard characteristics I’ve read show that it’s something that we’ll all have to spend and with which we’ll be able to progress further.
Choosing inactivity is shortly unacceptable,” he said.
The goal of the 700 billion plan is to purchase for taxpayers’ money of suspicious claims and risk and non-selling assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis, resolved by the breakdown of the bubble on the real estate market, which first led to the breakdown of risk hypothetic loans (subprimes), then moved to another, more widespread form of loans (PCAA) and excreted in cash freezing and banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first draft of the last week agreement is at the heart of Republican Members.
Since the Democrats have agreed that the government will only handle some "toxic" assets of companies with difficulties, but not buying them, it has been convinced that the east-free situation is unclear.
In an attempt to closer the contradictory opinions of the Congress, measures were attached that the government would be able to impose new fees to help her get her deposit back if, as a result of the programme, she would have to take over losses for five years.
The new plan will calculate the first 250 billion deposit, which will be possible to add another 100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
Additional 350 billion deposits should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his aid, Washington gets shares in rescued companies, which will pay him in case of profits and which will be able to sell again after it's finished.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the proceedings of loan-related real estate deposits, as well as to set limits for the amount of evaluation and compensation paid to employees with disabilities.
The leaders of the plan would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is still uncertain if their plan will have green.
Yesterday, votes were still against this project in both the Republican and the Democratic camp.
"It is obvious that Washington won't hear you," said Scott Garrett, a member of the House's financial committee, at the address of voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
It is not a solution to pay taxpayers."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressors called “the committee of skeptics”, presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred weighing professors of economy, including three Nobel Prize winner, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to hurry too quickly and carefully examine the way to go,” he said.
At the same time, Europe once again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis Bank Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it deviates from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the edge of a breakthrough since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) due to a non-state risk loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the twenty largest European banks and among the ten largest insurance providers.
"We're not going to get this money," Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"We gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And this is what domestics and craftsmen today are able to appreciate.”
On the other hand, La Manche’s channel has yet to appear, the British government has launched the nationalization of other banks affected by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government had to take over all existing loans of Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) constituted real estate loans.
According to his last announcement, Santander Bank will purchase subsidiaries and accounts from the British Bank’s customers.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with Azur eyes for a long time represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor have a fascinating smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The sensitivity, the sensitivity, and the unsuccessful talent that he had had, also distanted him from the strength category that yields true stars.
What a long run was it!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of American fatty years of cinema.
Less great than Brando, who was similar to and for a long time was his rival on the film band, Newman was a more cautious actor, surely a crusher, but also a apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was a Hungarian.
One of these European roots was born among the famous faces of the American dream.
Without overwhelming emo, which is the last sign of quality.
Because he looked all of this country in love with self-made mana, a warrior in the Pacific, wounded in the battle, who studied the actress in Yale in the early 50s, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated the triumph in theatre, television and film games.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer, who placed himself as the second on the Le Mans 24 Hour Race in 1979, and was a sexual symbol, although since 1958 he has been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward.
He also leaves the shadows of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the story of his own show-busines, which will remain to a certain extent mysterious.
Hearful man, in the most upset word.
Paul Newman’s departure this weekend led to envying lovers of the film, while his great role competes together on a black-plate memory.
After it, more than half a century defiles the constantly changing American Seventh Art.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a burning roof, the 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation.
From the less-old past (1990) we are equipped with his sensitive Mr. Bridge, unexpected in the advanced age of marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
There are so many Newman Pauls in history.
Rocky Graziano, a violent, unforgettable delicvent from Somebody Up There Likes Me, Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman in 1956 introduced into a real reputation.
Sympatic gangster in The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character created in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, bringing him a single Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This face of the ages, it was him.
And he's back.
In his vocational path, various eras compete together.
Youths are mostly known by the cult Slap Shot George Roye Hill (1977) of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers of Coen.
He then closed his career as the Irish Mafia man in Road to Perdition Sama Mendese in 2003.
Unlike a few movie legends that soon left the work, Newman stayed in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with his shirts, shows and defeats.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered her “a live challenge of underplaying,” the court said he had too much pressure on the pillar in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came as a lift, the professions were not always so gentle.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps, and despairs, whose falls and rebellion reflected in its perfect characteristics.
As a director, Newman revealed a few known pages of his shameful sensitivity.
His film Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (as the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, who was lost for overdose, was dedicated to Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of study and sadness.
In the friendship of honor that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former fighter Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) annoyed: "My presence made my life and this country better."
The generosity, the love of life, these are the main characteristics of the dead actor.
If we remember his legendary career, he also leaves a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opponent of Hollywood’s fall.
We were accustomed to seeing his image on bottles of wine octet, potatoes, dryers, and other foods, which might seem unexperienced enough to us, although it was in the beginning of Gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Heavy Childhood.
Newman, rather than allowing him to join the glory, was engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the words: "Everything and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was proud that I could be here.”
And for us it was the honour to watch the path of life that was so brilliant and generous American artist.
And, in the end, a patterned citizen.
What was done in the Zuschlag & spol. invoices factory?
Soon, on 8 October, a criminal proceedings against Jannosi Zuschlag and his colleagues will begin.
Politicians and their colleagues are accused, in addition to other crimes, including fake documents, of a long-term and systematic criminal organization, which resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutors, the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and the performance of tasks often proved by fictional invoices.
Money from the state and the self-government - a total of about 65 million forints - took part in the Fiatal Baloldal fund, part in the pockets of individuals.
The way it was also informed by the investigative authority was that the money obtained in public competitions was selected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter-valuation, and that the union's accepted commitments never met.
According to the accusation, most of the bills were fake.
Prints on these invoices came from the józsefváros market, the round tape was made in Kiskunhalasi.
On the names of which the company has to produce invoices, it has been decided, among other things, on a round trip across the northern coast of Balaton, to which István Ladose Janos Zuschlag has sent.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to look at the guesthouses and restaurants.
In them he asked for accounts for his consumption, according to which the pattern was then produced invoices submitted within the public competitions issued, among other things, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, by the Self-Administration of the capital.
The facts were mostly issued by Stefan Lados and his partner András Őrim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
In his "study journey," Lados looked at one beer.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his colleagues in 2003, this hospitality eating facility provided for a ninety-nine-member group of Biztos Pont.
However, according to the company's leader, so many people would not be able to enter this device at once.
Similarly, the official and content errors of the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the foundation Jobb Jövő, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomia had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn’t sleep one night in it, although a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the bill.
However, printers with a rich imagination exceeded this even when they pointed to the documents the company also addressing the hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in which, according to the information provided by the State Representative, documents listed by Jobb Jövőért and Hopa.
Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was called to the prosecutor and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"Our company's name and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, besides formality, it did not even agree that hundreds of people, according to the facts, have only eleven rooms that do not have such a high capacity.
In addition, food was also listed on the invoice, while their restaurant hasn’t been working for a long time.
The invoice manufacturers did not even believe that the examining Budapest travel office only organizes foreign travel, and that on a cash-paying invoice, which was also uncontracted with the company’s invoice practice, they introduced bankrupts as a travel mediation service to Hungary.
In addition, the VAT was also stated in the document, as it occurred during the investigation, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On the four documents issued by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, to the VAT. For the activity of the company is not subject to 25 per cent, but 15 per cent VAT, in addition to the hotel's employees only issued printed invoices, the invoices were made.
In addition, the "releasers" destructed the invoice, for example, by stating that one of the companies, through the investigation of the State Representation, was evidently carried out as an operation of road transport of goods, which the company initially did not carry out on investment advisory.
The facts issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the 21st Century Cultural Association and Biztos Pont were fake, but it was also due to formal deviations - the non-facultative format of the facts and the wrong spread.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfeherto, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the counterfeitors did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was at the time (2001) when a group of Fiatal Városért was feeding with it in liquidation, and that’s why, according to our information, the company’s liquidation Commissioner also denied the issue of paper.
Facts were consciously exposed
The second group of invoice groups consists of those who knew they had to issue a fictional invoice.
The Esély Foundation for Budapest has issued accounts for about four million forints for the foundation Harmadik Évezredért at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Socialisták.
Collab s. r. o. charged one of the accused Ludovic Györfi’s fictional accounts.
With Zuschlag and its partners, Biogate s. r. o. has also cooperated in liquidation, which in 2003 was stocked by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations with invoices worth approximately five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Neither the movement of money, as the invoices created were cancelled later, which, however, had already forgotten to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoice companies belongs to those who had links to the accused.
For example, Iván Kubatov was entrusted with the representative of the Ukrainian dealer Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with trafficking of motor vehicles and commodities, headquartered in Budapest, but the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computing technology funds worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, Cash Investment s. r. o. purchased these invoices since 14 September 2005.
One of the companies was a Romanian man who had to transmit documents related to the company as well as Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that, on behalf of the company, he issued invoices to associations Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and accepted their countervaluation.
On request, Iván Kubatova was founded by the Romanian branches of Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the accused because they had no job.
However, the companies benefited him because, at the request of the convicted lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding charter, issued invoices to the companies of Atlasz and Y-Generación linked to Zuschlag.
In the name of the company Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kuba’s organizations have a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Representative said Cuba had reached 10 percent of the amounts listed on the invoices and VAT.
To expose fictional invoices, this time for the selection procedure for the Biztos Pont community, the man also used Szi-Beri company k. t.
In January 2006, the Föderations Y-Generación and Szöfeség and Modern Magyarország submitted proposals to the public competition of the Foundation Mihálye Tancsicse (TMA), a publicly beneficial organisation of the socialist party.
They earned 500 thousand forints, but they did not spend the amount on the targets set out in the proposals.
To prevent this from happening, TMA presented five fictional invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found at the home survey at the Arpáda Kemecsei office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, part of the accused will probably describe the course of the production of invoices, as it has already done at the prosecutor.
It can be more interesting if it decides to reveal everything by itself the main accused János Zuschlag.
His present confession is not too detailed, and although he has promised that it will be exponently, he hasn’t done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for causing a large portion of harm, fifty million forints, perhaps socialists have concluded an agreement with him, and Zusi will take it on.
He could still be offended because his requests for relief of the conditions of his detention, namely, for the placement in the domestic prison, remained unexpected.
While criminals of economic crimes that have suffered much greater damage that have not been compensated for, they can walk freely or at least wait for the end of their proceedings in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychicism: Why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and apparently irrational - behaviour have been revealed to researchers from the University of New York University of Neurology and Economy.
According to their studies, published in the journal Science, people in the eBay auction competition do not want to stop, so they prefer to pay too much price.
Research with the help of experimental auction attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in gambling auctions, with the fMRI method being examined in the active areas of the brain of experimental persons.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the auction game, the important element of which is to cross the other side, began to work intensively in the loss of the whole under the brain curve, called a striatum.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-changing" mechanism of the nervous system.
The increase in price is therefore possible to explain, according to the researchers, by attempting to avoid the sharp reaction of the striat.
To submit their theory, members of the research team from a number of economists conducted a financial cross-cutting investigation.
On the other hand, three groups were tending against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product, and they made bets.
Additionally, members of the group were promised that if they get out of the game win, they will get $15 for another prize.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but in the case of a loss, its members also paid the money.
The difference between the two groups consists of all over the world in the fact that one was emphasized the victory and the other loss.
However, members of the group playing "controversy" were willing to go higher than was in the control and "win" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neuroologists.
“These results cannot be drawn out of any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the phenomena observed at auctions of the joy of victory and avoiding risk.
When neurological imaging methods helped us solve the dispute between these two theories by now reaching the third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to look for a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is one of the main causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason is that sick people often do not know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, characteristic of inflammation of the liver and the yellow, but the origin of the disease and the disease caused by them vary from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the origin of the disease, spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E by digestive systems (e.g., foods infected, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and body fluids (sperma, bowel secretion, slices).
In any case, travellers should be protected by vaccinations against A and B virus, there is no type C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after eating an infected meal, usually associated with fatigue, weakness, abdominal problems, vomiting.
Then on the skin and white eyes, a yellow, bright chair and dark urine will be created. Treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year a million people worldwide die from a more serious type of disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every ten infected drugs are treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected with their disease do not know, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells in a circle, and thus the first symptoms will occur in many cases in up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent in time, to carry out regular detection.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who had transfusions of blood before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the expected global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already prove a routine laboratory examination, the person should, in the event that he notices any symptom of unknown origin, contact his practical doctor.
When the disease is detected in time, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infections and preventing cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized by the organizations representing the diseased for the first time worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to point out the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its emergence and the importance of timely recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God isn’t that so much?
According to recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic, which could facilitate the death of already Catholic torturers.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment, studying how humans have influenced the faith in the god of pain, the British newspaper Telegraph said.
As part of a strange survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while everyone watched the painting showing Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholics were able to exclude much of the pain.
Thanks to the technician, the detailed examination of the human brain, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the control of pain.
Research is the first of the series of fears to be attended by academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
Completely accurately the test was carried out by attaching an electric shock tool to the left hand of the testing body.
The researchers asked the participants of the attempt to carefully observe two paintings: Sassoferrat’s Virgin Mary from the 17th century, and Lady with the feast of Leonardo da Vinci, naked in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that viewing the Virgin Mary would create a certain state of piety in the believers, while Da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not too different from the first and acts according to them as a calming impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanning, and during this time they received the following four parts of 20 electroshots, while watching the image separately with a religious or general theme.
Catholics said they felt “safe” when they looked at Virgin Mary, as if they were “required” and “called down, peace filled them.”
When watching the image with a religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain in their statement than when they had Leonard’s work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved using any powerfully impressive image even in atheists, it is only necessary to find the right photo.
"We should find a picture that they will see very positively, from the position of the mother or father," the psychologist said.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, the question is just what effect would have on the control of the pain of believers if they showed them some madon from Leonardo or a similar painter.
Would a look at the quality of Virgin Mary have even better results?
You're what you're gonna divide from yourself
About its tenth birthdays, Google can declare that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as above the sky; they know where they were on vacation, where professional investigations are going and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's boss, this is still not enough.
However, as for skeptics, which are parallel to Orwell’s dark vision, they are not the very essence of the site 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal data about users, which is necessary to ensure that Google founders can keep their original intention, which said: “Let’s arrange all information in the world!”
According to Google, even after ten years, the company is still at the beginning to work with all the information.
In the next five years, Schmidt replied that if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what work would actually work for me?" - such apparently simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until the user knows about information.
Not all users of the Internet know well that the search word is captured during the internet search, even from which IP address was searched and on which pages the interested parties moved after the search.
Thanks to Personalized Search, started two years ago, users can, for example, keep the history of their surfing, re-view what they were looking and clicking on, and then generate findings that are much more adapted directly to them - on the same logic will be based on the Recommendations services, which will be based on the system above.
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone looks at me, what am I dealing with? - they ask users who are afraid to look at the data monopoly of Google.
In most cases, the range of potential powers represented by the company is more threatening, anti-reaction does not cause in the Internet users consciousness of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all searched terms are not only captured, but in reasoned cases may also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases the personality of Internet users does not protect anything.
The most famous example of recent was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites created through it.
Internet users who are afraid of personal rights could, however, be dismissed in May when EFF’s electronic rights organization successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google should not be forced to provide any information to the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully eliminated nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of searched phrases, which she obtained with a call for reinforcement before years of the adopted Children’s Protection Act, yet she failed to obtain the lists of searched items of the individual users, including the full lists of the website.
Google’s view is quite controversial: it’s bitter for those who are afraid of providing their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will begin using Google’s services, exposed to harm, and act against it with a revolt that belongs to transnational companies with conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild turtle, grouping enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, in which they see a new generation of great-grandfathers, "corporation that is now struggling," unlike its Microsoft rival, regarded as the same as the winners of the world.
This can be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require identification code from its users and does not want money for their applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and packages of programs act as much more accessible, younger, "cooling" than the practice of the official software store.
However, this can also be due to the exact understanding of the very problematic relationship between the Internet and the personal rights, which has brought with it just one of the most brilliant keywords of the last few years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing else than cooperation, that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels we have, and although their scope is available for each other, the essence remains the same: we show.
An average young person can run a profile on several social sites from Facebook to Xang, which can be quietly connected to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm apps, recording music to listen to him, and then it can be all that the guy can put on automatic navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm more.
At the same time, we can learn about a lot of exemplary cases from which she discovers: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at the flood of photographs of joint friends, will easily come to the one with whom her sweet friend spent the night with, or the company can just overcome his life by exploring his worker just because he can make a single day exploring his own honesty on his blog.
The person who lives online is made up of what shows himself so that we can define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (e.g., Scrooglem, who uses the Google search system, but does not deliberately leave traces).
For example, a lot of people are not physically registered on community sites to find them. The online application of Google from the text editor to the photo editor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not linked to the huge server parks and which do not include the best possible profile from us.
Public opinions are not secretly expected when Google will show the deficiencies.
With its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten investments of advertising agencies and services that are constantly introduced to the accelerating rate of software, which seriously disturbs life not only the next designer, but also the other Microsoft.
Critical observers, however, also find contra-points that act in a disruptive way: for example, the top leadership completely refused the protests of employees after the double-rate of corporate school fees, which each of the government’s interests were in 2006, or the interests of the day-to-day eating was in 2006, and the interests of the company’s leadership were in fact too expensive, so that it was all.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds like it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems in the next months and years can affect the world in new places: while some think we have the computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good default material for the next generation of science fiction writers, the famous novel of Cory Doctorow "Scroogled" describes the future of Orwell’s reminiscence in which a person can be scaryly approached with only the help of Google data.
Two teenagers have helped eliminate the traces of two teenagers.
Two youths have been interrogated by police in the case of double murder in Osdod, according to a reasonable suspicion that they helped eliminate the stops of this crime, said the spokeswoman of the Supreme Police Office of Borsod on Tuesday.
Persons who have been suspected and are currently accused of aid of a criminal offence.
Both teenagers, according to the MTI, have two girls beaten to freedom.
Criminal infringement is punishable by removing freedom for up to five years.
A suspect of a double murder in Osda, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into temporary bond on Sunday.
He is suspected of a pre-planned crime of multiple murders for fine reasons.
During the investigation, a 23-year-old man owed a 53-year-old man a higher amount.
The suspect didn’t want to pay his debt, so he threw his creditor into a business in Ozda last Wednesday, where he killed a man first and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, a young man was preparing to commit a crime in advance, which also proves that the murder was committed by a weapon hidden in the place of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech krones - offered by the Warsaw Securities Exchange for the purchase of a 100 percent stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Securities Exchange, confirmed the proposal made by the Polish party, although the Czech Warsaw Exchange had already been excluded from the circuit of possible new owners of the Prague Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw storm is the state.
99% of shares are in the hands of a Polish state who wants to sell 60 percent of securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic journal E15, the Polish offer represents the highest amount that has been offered to the beneficiaries of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech papers, the Vienna Securities Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have been offered.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, not excluding that this could lead to the destruction of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Securities Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90% of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Investment Bank Patria Finance with an approximately 25 percent share, followed by the Czech Republic with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
The Financial Crisis from the European Letters
In their Tuesday comments on the profoundness of the international financial crisis, the leading European lists recalled "the second September 11th".
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the U.S. President, accusing the Roman La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to shake his own side in support of the fast-paid bill, aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second September 11.
A part of the Madridian press also sees a blame in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the world economy has led to the collapse of the lack of political leadership.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is constantly growing, which will ultimately pay the whole world.
Bush’s plan wasn’t perfect, but after the Congress’s vote, Washington couldn’t offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world’s economy climbs in the air – just when one of the biggest changes in capitalism’s history is happening.
The threat can no longer be remembered, the Geneva newspaper Tages-Anzeiger says.
So far, individual States can place a rescue circle to repaying monetary institutions and taxpayers can save them from crash.
If, however, more banks are dominating, there will no longer be enough money or any other improvisation.
In the long run, the Member States of the European Union need to move through their national egoism and to unite control over the disintegrated financial markets.
Only on Monday, the monetary constitutions have received more than €100 billion, recalled the Vienna Der Standard, according to which concerns are that, like the Americans, they will have to get deep into the pockets and European taxpayers, increasingly realistic.
The European Union is a crisis that, as a tsunami, has yet to be serious about the old continent.
"Reservoirs" should not immediately have billions of euros, but it would be good if they were firmly determined, in which case it was reasonable to seize taxpayers' money to prevent even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bulb
What would probably be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing crashes unless the imitation of detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
For example, in the bees.
The default strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the CEATEC Japanese fair, invaded engineers from Nissan bulbs. It was about how to build a new generation of rain prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a biomimetic robotic control system of the type BR23C, a robotized mini-car equipped with bees’ properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate any rash.
“During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of a oval shape, which is actually very similar to our security protection packaging,” Kazuhiro Doi, the brand’s Director General for Technology PR and Research and Development, said at the exhibition.
It plays an important role in complex eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions in the angle of more than 300 degrees.
In order to copy the function of the complex eye, the engineers followed the idea of a laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters before BR23C in the 180-degree sound field, calculates their distance and sends signals to the column microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation to prevent rainfall.
The obstacle is captured during a break of a second, then the robotized car begins to imitate the bees movements and the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the rain immediately change direction.
Unlike any existing system, this moving manure is carried out in a completely instinctive manner.
“If this hadn’t happened, robotic car wouldn’t be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Tošijuki Ando, the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
They must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology matches the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety protection packaging, inside which the rain is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bees do to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than the blinding of the eye.
However, unlike the bees, this movement cannot direct upwards, downwards or angularly, can only be double-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the infinite options offered by bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and slowing down was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, meaning they have longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, an instinctive, intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process, the less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond only to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need to retain and react with an intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so constantly use only a memory of a few kilobates.
It does not need a memory with a giga or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing technology for immediate escape, which Nissan estimates would be able to reach serial vehicles within ten years.
Another possibility of application may represent the connection of the unit with the satellite GPS navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the final target when avoiding the road’s obstacle.
My dear child has a name.
The $700 billion economic rescue package law, which is to be divided into several deposits and which aims to purchase non-quality loans from banks, is already in writing.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further negotiations, which ended until Saturday after midnight of the U.S. East Time, Congress representatives reached an agreement in a few days on a $700 billion total rescue package, Reuters said.
"We have achieved significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Chairman of the House of Representatives, said, according to which only the conclusion of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson stated the outcome of the compromise: "The program will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written image of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. in the evening of the Washington Times (which was Monday at 2 p.m. in the middle-European time), but no special rise in the stock markets.
On the draft legal standard on the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, which is to be set up the programme, the House of Representatives will first vote on Monday, and then a series will be held in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, after which the reports of the deal were also welcomed in the White House.
“With the progress that was achieved at night, we are very pleased and we appreciate both sides’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, however, differs from Bush’s original proposal, in which it should be intended to spend the total amount of $700 billion at a sudden on the purchase of non-quality securities incurred by hypotheses.
Now it is possible to spend up to half of the first 700 billion amount, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after what the Congress decides on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance buys for them securities secured by hypotheses, which are estimated as a non-quality president, which will judge the remaining $100 billion for a hell decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special assembly, whose member will also be the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half spending of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: at the same time, it may purchase non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, respectively, other "continuous" loans.
The purchase can take place directly within the auctions, the officials of the Ministry reported.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance program, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee of funds that constitute anxiety, which will then pay the company the price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary funds to spend up to $700 billion on the urgent demands of the U.S. financial system, whether it's about a large purchase of bad funds, their insurance or preventing the systemic risk associated with the breakdown of some of the big money systems.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The boss of banks who have entered trouble and are waiting for the state to help, on the contrary, can count on the fact that the government reduces their deviations - which is simply called a golden fall in the offshore slaughter.
The limitation of their payment will only occur in certain cases, in addition, these limitations will depend on the way of assistance provided by the Ministry.
In essence, limitations mean that if the ministry is purchasing within the auction, a taxation will be imposed on the golden banks if the bank’s executives fail, they will be sent straight to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of non-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order not to overcome the money for leadership.
It is necessary to add that existing golden falling contracts do not change, the limitation applies only to new contracts, which should be another stimulus to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in U.S. history to have a legal restriction on the remuneration of the Directors-General," said Barney Frank, President of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the State in the banks participating in the programme is entitled to obtain a share, reducing the risk of taxpayers, as the economy and the saving bank, together with it, can also make profits on this transaction.
The draft plan contains that the President must submit a proposal to Congress in the next five years to determine how taxpayers can repay the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were voices expressing doubts on both sides.
"This is not what U.S. citizens have asked for, because this is the dollar of taxpayers' non-protection," California Congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Democratic colleague from Ohia, Mary Kaptur, judges that those who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street were urgent for the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent in the previous month, and 12.9 per cent in comparison with August 2007, the Central Statistical Authority said.

Also, domestic sales prices in the processing industry increased slightly, by 0.1 percent, compared to July.
The highest price rise in the leather and shoe industry (2.8 per cent) in August 2008, particularly due to the intermount price rise in the brass and seat products industry by 4.6 per cent, respectively by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price levels of plastic and chemical raw materials have caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemicals and products industry (1.6%).
Prices have been reduced in the oil processing industry (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machines and equipment (0,9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking industry (0.1 per cent).

In the sectors of consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the processing energy and in the processing sectors, prices did not change in the previous month.
The biggest price rise in the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy processors and further processors (16.8 percent).
In the sectors of consumer goods, we measured a price rise of 6.8 per cent, in the case of assets, on the contrary, a price drop of 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, with a decrease of 3.9% in the 12-month comparison.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a great hope that the U.S.-Hungarian Visa-free Agreement will enter into force around 12 January, the Foreign Minister spoke about it in Chicago in front of the heads of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now almost everything matters only if an electronic road permit system, respectively, is built outside the sea in time."
At the same time, she noted that a new system will not be allowed to enter, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian diplomat has been continuing to negotiate in Washington since today.
He meets with the Foreign Minister Condoleezzo Rice, who transmits the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order for the Debt of the Hungarian Republic, and leads conversations with the Foreign Policy Advisor of the Democratic Party Presidential Candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCaina.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, president candidates of the two major U.S. parties, agreed on Sunday to ensure their support for a $700 billion bank rescue package, but there are also politicians who demand the dismissal of the Minister of Finance.
After a several-day marathon negotiations by Congress and the officials of the administration, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic bank rescue package was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to overcome the Wall Street crisis and the freezing loan market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are consistently referred to as a more suitable of both candidates that would lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys at the same time as how they got into the front of economic issues, Obama gained a certain advantage again and McCain's mass collapsed after the Republican convention nominated by Sarah Palin as vice president.
Obama said on Sunday at the election meeting in Detroit the hope that a 700 billion package law will be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passes on consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act right away, responsiblely... to your places, savings, industry, stability of the whole economy," he said.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas of the economy old.
McCain explained in an interview with the ABC television station: “But this will be a little cause (...) but unworking is simply not a way.”
As stated by the Republican Senator, in the proposal of the figure, a supervisory minister for finance and the limitation of the derogation for the senior representatives for whom he had lasted.
Obama for CBS stated that McCain had no more important role in negotiations, but he himself was in everyday contact with the Minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House's representatives would vote on the bill already on Monday.
Overview of printing German language area
The legal camp is unbroken, only voters inside it became more self-confidence - so analyzes the weak outcome of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
Haiderians are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Mirror ( mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine, Franz Walter in his article entitled "Bavarian Revolution eagerly defeats his father" defeats the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known politician, CSU’s erosion began a long time before its office took over the sad duo of Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are deviating from them.
The time limit is the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not completely surprised for CSU, but on Saturday it ended a process that could be assumed for almost ten years: it ended the uncontroversial hegemonia of one party.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU rose to 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 50s below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, in the so often mentioned Stoibero period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that is eating from its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have been very misleading at a rate. Secularization, educational results, German settlements from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not have been without any consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The legal camp is unbroken, only voters within it became more self-confidence, more critical, more honorable.
It is also evident that in the last few weeks, the CSU has most restrained just the classical civil layer; people in a free profession, livelihoods, individuals with a master’s degree and with higher education.
The CSU’s support has already declined below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The presidents are resilient in matters of the coalition" devotes a confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP undertakes the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears open to all negotiations, greens do not yet want to talk about the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything is rotating around the coalition; in the debate held in public television, the presidents did not let them watch their cards.
Speaker Werner Faymann has confirmed that he wants to deal with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership.
The question of whether the coalition will also be introduced to Wilhelm Molterer, current President ÖVP, as Vice-Center, left Faymann open.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted over to each fall.
Repetition of this direction does not take into account.
Molterer responded with caution to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann attempts to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether his side chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, the side is fully open, these issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was again open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility,” Haider said.
Jaróková: It is necessary to break down the sharp circle of poverty and segregation
The European Equality Summit, which this year hosts France, is the current President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, MEP of the European People’s Party for the Movement Fidesz, as one of the main speakers of the expertise in its message addressed to the plenary focused on segregation in education, as it is one of the most severe unrighteousnesses of Roman children, and also the most severe obstacle to their use.
The summit was initiated - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and equal opportunities.
Annual meetings were among the invited government leaders, European social partners, the most important European rights protection organizations and civil associations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the European Movement Group, Fidesz Járók has noted that, in addition to discrimination that occurs in the collection of labour forces, Romans are expelled from the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Romans do not have high school education and due to poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education."
Yarovic further stressed that education as a fundamental human rights plays a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roman children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to establish awareness of these relationships in the broader circles - among Roman and Roman children.
The sooner the student of Rome starts school, the more likely it will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and consumer taxes contribute to the national budget.
"The right of their European citizenship is to ensure the right to quality education and to ensure the removal of their inadequate quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, consistency of the European Union is necessary with an emphasis on the objectives and actions to speed up the processes of desegregation of schools, and it is primarily important to properly comply with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the sharp circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; it is necessary to provide children with the possibility of a given democratic space to be able to participate as full-right citizens in the future of Europe," Jarokov said.
The European Year of Equality is guaranteed to each of the European Summit of Equality, held annually since last meeting in Berlin, to ensure a separate forum that helps achieve the objectives of equality and elimination of discrimination at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary grace
Destiny of Huber-Beckstein's fate will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debakl, the debate on personal issues has been resigned by the Bavarian CSU’s tops.
President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their positions, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandemus, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will decide the extraordinary congress of the party last October weekend.
Members of a very criticized duo, in any case, were allowed to hear that they wouldn’t get rid of all the forces on their posts.
They attempted to calm down the fraction and base members who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavarian tsunas" export of personal consequences.
Five years ago — the truth, yet under Edmund Stoiber’s leadership on top of his career — the Christian-social union gained 60.7 per cent, now, a year after the strike against Stoiber, but its forces were only 43.4 per cent.
CSU has been producing 18 percent of German GDP in Bavaria for 46 years.
Conservatives in the Southern Union still have high positions, but in the future they will be forced to coalition.
One of the first characteristics of the reorganization within the party is that a member of a narrow scientific team that will start a survey negotiations on the possible coalition of the Monaco government with the Liberal FDP, respectively with the right-oriented collection of Free voters, will also be the Deputy Chairman and the Federal Minister of Agriculture only.
It is ironical that Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber used Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the gun, has come into the House for the candidate of the Free Elections, but then, with an ambitious community policy, they have made an unpleasantly short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, the active role will also belong to Stoiber, who has so far been friendly with the backbones, the former country prime minister, and the former president of the CSU called on September 28 the most challenging day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber broke out several jealous notes on the CDU, according to him that they would deserve much greater support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections in September 2009 in the Bundestag, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in national success in 2005, in some way will not play on the legs of joint forces.
According to Merkel, which hardly hid its disappointment due to the fiasco, the loss of CSU position will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
That is, of course, relative: the treatment of the injured CSU will not be easier and the crisis of the social democrats will continue.
The SPD has reached 18.6% of the worst result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukašenko: opposition - 110:0
In the elections on Sunday, no one of the members of the Belarusian parliament took place.
This can be explained according to Russian observers of the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukašenk, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OECD) the illegalities that have occurred in the number of votes.
The OBSE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the elections.
Although the 110-member Legislative Assembly of 10 million countries has lost the opposition for well ten years, the opposition unified under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections had seriously hoped that Lukašenko, who left several opponents on the basis of the change of the constitutions, would re-election this mandate in the parliament with a debated course of 2006
The ODS has also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition expectation was that Russia's economically increasing dependence on Belarus - which has taken loans in Russia's constantly exaggerating import of natural gas and has also contributed to allowing Beltransgaz's political company, the own gas pipeline, not to improve the EU's political company, to unite with Russia's hands, to unite with the Russians.
The release was previously pointed out that the OBSE emphasized positive moves in the evaluation of the election campaign, not deficiencies - for example the ban on candidates for one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OBSE Monday’s blasphemous report already had reserves for a campaign during which opposition candidates could basically not appear in the press, especially for the fact that the opposition could not be present with a number of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners were released to freedom, and Minsk is willing to go to smaller confrontations with Moscow, while it continues to refuse to recognize the month of independence from Georgia to the south of Osetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which this state, is defeated.
"We have made two steps ahead and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remains, although "the power has failed to leave one single member of the opposition in the meaningless parliament".
In view of the results of the opposition, it does not plan protests, but rather seeks to deliver its message to voters on the need for economic reforms.
"With this we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition leaves in Russia, the distribution puts obstacles to local authorities, but I see that the change is supporting more and more people, even among the elders," said Milinkevich, a group of people, stressing that the social regime of Lukašenk, which is not the best of his success.
“Due to the country’s debt and growth of business deficits, it’s just a matter of time when social security is “conducing the silence of the cemetery” to collapse,” Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian election observers were evaluated as democratic.
Independent states mission leader Sergei Lebedev told Russian reporter agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but in acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that the rotary door was introduced at the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today this new measure begins to work against anointed people, against those who rise and then go to coffee at work time.
The report was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetto, and the Secretary-General of the President’s Council, Maurem Masi.
"Rotary doors," Brunetta says, "are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services," the minister explains.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will be opened.
“It’s reformism,” Brunetta said.
With the Palace of Chigi we will complete the introduction in all the buildings of the Board’s presidency.
For Masih, “the choice of rotary doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
There were no objections by employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint procedure with employees and cooperation of all".
In short, there is no breakfast at work; there is no coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, “There’s nothing better than a good cappuccino at seven in the morning.”
During a conference at the Higher Educational School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, i.e. by 60,000 more people a year at work.”
It adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more effective.
"His payment dynamics have doubled over the past 8-10 years in relation to the private sector and is much higher than the inflation percentage."
In the meantime, thousands of public employees gathered to reject Brunetto’s Decree standards in accordance with the requests supported by Codacons.
“While today, the Minister of Public Administration presents figures relating to a lower absence in work due to the disease,” says a consumer protection association, “the nation of the ‘people’ is constantly growing.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration that have gathered to declare war as illegal standards contained in the Decree.”
On Taru, it will be protested primarily against the exclusion of hospital fees, which depends on activity; the extension of the time when the patient can be checked, the time limits for inspection visits will be carried out, and against the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour injuries, Napolitano: "Resolution prevention"
There are 2,500 workers injuries every day in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail estimates confirm that in 2007, we have approximately 1,200 deaths as a result of work injuries.
These values show the severity of the indication, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the deaths compared to murders.
In order to draw the attention of the institutions, social and information media on this dramatic issue, Anmil celebrates today in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of the Victims of Injuries laid down on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data extended by Anmile and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of labour safety is," said President Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmile, the National Association for Frozen and Disabled for Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its live admiration for constant joint efforts to ensure safety at work, to protect injured workers, to help families of victims and to participate in public opinion."
"Obviously, the 'dough' has been raised, sincerely shared face-to-face with the tragedy that in their way causes disruption in the media and participation in public opinion, but the daily fact offers us dramatic cases, even recurring in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
The number of education initiatives are of particular importance to ensure that young people who are faced with the world of labour gain more clear awareness.
It is necessary to notify this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The president of the Chamber of Commerce, Gianfranco Fini, said, “how the death phenomenon as a result of a working crash creates absolute critical social status, how it insults each of us’ consciences and pushes all institutions to convincing efforts towards the necessary end of this state.”
"With regard to the data of labour injuries, it appears to be a positive turn, but it doesn't surprise that the number of deaths as a result of the labour injury is so alarming," said President Anmilu Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want this "reduction" to lead to less attention, because at the moment of the attention draws up, tragedy will erupt.
"We believe that a lot of work is done in general to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
“It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase controls and inspections, but also to be more active in the field of training of employees, right from the age of school,” Mercandelli said.
“There is still a need for further effort in relation to communication and participation of public opinion.
But most importantly, it is necessary to make greater responsibility by employers for a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli finally stated that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of compensation for workers' victims and the "deduction of support care" that the system has achieved in recent years.
“The purpose of this is to return an insurance guarantee to the employee, because the fate of those who are hurting does not depend on spontaneity or the donation of time from time to time by the legislator.”
Mp3 players are accused of risk hearing
Listening to sound music for a longer time and using portable music devices as a Mp3 player can cause lasting hearing damage.
According to the European Commission’s today publication, which cites the opinions of the Committee on Health Risk, which recently developed and identified (Csrseri) Eu, in one of the official reports extended in Brussels.
“The scientific opinion, we read in notes, shows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years using mobile music devices more than an hour a week a day and maintain a high-voice device are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I’m worried that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an unrepairable way,” Meglena Kuneva admits.
“Scientific findings – continues the leader – have a clear risk and need to respond quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery so that they become fully effective and keep a step with new technology.”
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem due to the high use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"The leaders," said the EU Executive Officer, "recognize the need to worry, and now the European Commission, together with the other members and parties who have raised the problem, checks what measures would be possible to take and thus better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, and the musical instrument of which is transmitted by the source."
Currently, there is already a safety standard, which limits the noise level of mobile music devices to 100 dB, but there is a growing concern about hearing damage, which can be caused by excessive exposure to similar noise forms.
It is very possible to limit these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing exposure levels and duration.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee states that users of mobile music devices, if they use music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed current limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise at workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a longer time risk the lasting loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantity can be counted between 2.5 to 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno leaves free movement to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we will start, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
This is the calendar given to Campidogliem workers "Commissions for the Future of the capital of Rome", which met in their new seat this morning behind Caracall's baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the committee will make a guide to Rome.
As soon as the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official strip" of Campidoglia and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
“The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural thoughts are included there – he wants to emphasise Alemanno – will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be applied by the political arbiters who remain Giunta e the General Council.
It’s not about no exchange of functions, but just about trying to have a place to work a great project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then dissolved, because these institutions must have a precise timeline.
“In June, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work carried out by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To those who accuse the Commission of unnecessaryness in view of the fact that their opinion is not binding, Alemanno will say: "It depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of quality, like the proposals of the Commission Attali, and so I am sure in Rome, its benefit will be decisive.
Too often, politics is exaggerated on everyday problems and emergency issues that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary business nor a blame: it is totally free, Roman citizens will not state the euro and will serve to consider and engage the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Aleman, in essence, "there must be a strategic plan as a default point, neither a definitive nor anxiety, in order to allow our city to rise at the authentic level that it necessarily needs, and to think of the unified spirit of its future."
The future that the Mayor of Rome "is not only limited to the current municipal border, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal statute, but also includes the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? First anti-American president. You already know why
A well-known American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
“The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions deceived the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with an enemy of Islam.”
The attacks on Obama are growing at the moment when the election date is coming.
One woman from Miami wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama, however, has the courage: he thinks he will get the highest position of a nation that had two governors and five black senators everywhere."
In fact, these attacks don’t say much,” they are obviously racial attacks and don’t answer the voters’ question: Will it be a good president? And then we have also surveys; everyone says Obama wins and with a big strike.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the south of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the electoral cabinet we know well who will give his voice to the American patriot.
One side of American mentality that remains shine until the last moment.
Say what you want, finally we'll take care of who to check out whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama had to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been pronounced before, seeming to be almost certain of the success of a black candidate.
However, beyond all these considerations for Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate?
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with hills to the back.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq has become a majority of Bush’s weakness.
Whoever arrives in Georgia W will have to carry out a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse was also felt by journalists: in the newspapers there is an investigation period, and many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the status of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions did not openly say they were less concerned about confidentiality.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a devastated economic model.
Apart from that, the cuts carried out in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to share the newspaper together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to be fundamentally changed, as it is understood by the broad public.
The U.S. journalist is a clear, but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors are convinced that journalists are issued a wrong way at the national level.
In the local area, the Executive Group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
A larger publisher is the way to the Internet, which many people look like a "killer" of prints.
“Economic pressure,” reporters warn, has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists have admitted that they are referring to technology in the hope of doing something good for their journalists.
The biggest loss in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms – that is, leaders – and journalists who work for them.
56% of national leaders believe that their reporters share their values, while local value drops to 23%.
This has to do with a "safe job" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their job in three years are 47% at the national level.
As for journalists, they are 30%.
When it comes to "safe work" related to staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In such a huge nation as the United States, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, newspapers, radios, television, and internet employers often offer what they want, and so it is a question to take or leave.
Leaders almost always receive enormous wages and the editor can earn ten thousand dollars a month without paying pensions and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, are often ill over a year.
It’s just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: Court in Rome, Danilo Coppala in GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the submission of a entrepreneur with the reality of Daniel Coppol, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferratha, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-offering at the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at its own expense, he received a release from home prison last week, which was transformed into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked a real-time entrepreneur to change his place of stay from the rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (which he expressed himself pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elity in Danger
This phenomenon occurred a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a significant portion of the Americans were more interested in punishment Wall Street than the rescue of the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is splitting the Republican party, constantly more divided between its old soul East Coast, more mild, closer to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is, on the contrary, a part of the world’s conservative, a part of the state’s enemy and a part of the state.
A soul that arrogantly expressed itself by the vote I spoke about at the beginning.
However, this very cited thing is just an example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but in the entire west and perhaps not only here.
Both in the U.S. and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of the phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, which are swallowed up in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the rejuvenation, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double-category State power in relation to a certain renaissance of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong pushes abroad, but in which they are mainly included in the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single country.
This also created a political problem for those who lead him: that means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families that are among others voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality appears to be substantially outside the game or has nothing to add: the European Union has given obvious evidence, which is as always divided between different interests and different state strategies, and which cannot be decided for one common policy line.
And so everyone expects the intervention of each state’s government, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules, and mainly the distribution of funds: at the moment we get into trouble, only states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to fix everything.
And also own resources and permissions to use them: two resources of extraordinary value, under certain circumstances, in which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to have the same level.
This new emphasis that the crisis is put on a state-national element, however, is increasingly in full compliance with the last economic progress that tries to convict one factor closely associated with it: territorial nationality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we entered the kingdom of the network, increasingly sophisticated technology, theterrial, while we were convinced that global finances were already predetermined to rule the world, from nothing we realized that our future would have to be more and more sophisticated.
All things that would be said can be transported from one place to another, but in any case, they are connected, absolutely, to a limited space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler will certainly have much more cards in his hand than who he is not, and who has the regrets that he lives in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I get to the second news that predicts evil.
Whoever speaks of territory, state, government, inevitablely speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Given the economic crisis, two convergence phenomena appear to be created.
On the one hand, it is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who could handle the situation.
On the other hand, the wave of discredit against existing leadership, particularly economic, which proved to be equally inappropriate and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense of calming: discreditation, impatience, feelings of inability and absence that are trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems to be increasingly widespread in the vast mass of beliefs of the population than that their actions are the same as the thoughts of popular elites, as their way of feeling and beings, as their culture in the real sense of words that elite has already overcome its time and is disproportionate to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership shortly consumes one turmoil from underground, but a strong movement to eliminate government classes and traditional political arrangements is manifested in the sudden elections' "reflections" or in the unexpected changes of the Bush's collective moods in the last and most recent, and, therefore, has the power of the British, to be conserved.
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasingly difficulty to understand, i.e. to represent, which, not today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is re-enhancing, expanding, over-potential.
Before that, it would be overwhelmed to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we certainly can’t say that it means to have well-open eyes.
Super leather to walk through the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to the super leather and walk through the walls in the future like Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centers and now a team of four institutes has very closely approached it.
Scientists managed to maintain a stokilogram body attached to the vertical wall using a label of only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a special structure of carbon called carbon pipes.
“We can imagine a series of tubes placed as an organized spaghetti toothbrush,” explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of gecon, covered with microscopic hairstyles that allow animals to ensure the perfect attachment.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new leather is ten times stronger than the knives of these beaches and at the same time "it simply differs from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary sticker" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps you can walk through the walls like Spiderman, but researchers think about a much less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because the bigger carbon tubes are heat and electricity conductors.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes so far.
The University of Berkley, California, is also dedicated to researching a new leather.
In one article in the American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced a microfiber-shaped leather as hair that cleans themselves from dust to surface movement to maintain the perfect suitability.
Medication: Never with juice
Beware of greep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these beverages that are consumed primarily in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with certain life-saving drugs, their use changes to strengthen or reduce effectiveness with serious health consequences.
In order to emphasize the risks of juice, both finished and fresh in combination with certain medicines, at the current 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia triggers a new threat to the elimination of health effects of patients: the elimination of the effects of their lives is sufficient for a glass of greep, orange and some bleaching.
Grep juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level of effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitics, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
This was notified by the Italian Medical Agency itself in the information bulletin two years ago and urged doctors and patients not to underestimate the risks arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they are drinking if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
GRAPHEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that glue the drugs.
A long list of effects of grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruby, director of the Department of Pharmacy at the State University of Milan, said: “These findings are mostly immediately informed of the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that possibly will organize and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative tickets of the drugs you get and if you hit something unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist to clarify,” Ansa said.
Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize for Economics
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and localization of economic activity.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenan who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the most important critics regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of Bush’s administration.
A few months after September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron crashed, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be much more important, in the sense of the consequences on the history of the United States than the first.
The prediction that caused no polemics, which was calculated for years, but which proved to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and shocked at the speed of collapses like Enron and Worldcom disappeared in public interest,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenza Biniho Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great importance", but also a popularist who has "very aggressive style, particularly critical against Bush's excesses of liberal administration."
Open Office, here we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
Open Office.org 3.0 is the day of release, a package of open source personal production that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year’s work of volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office displays widespread audiences with different news: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window are added to another, much more important, Document 1.2 standard, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and new format format support ISO.
In collaboration with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as what allows you to reduce PowerPoint presentation sizes, useful for an example for electronic transmission, or the possibility of transferring a PDF folder to a graphical implementation model and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
We can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that are similar to the typical Adobe format graphics and have the characteristics of a table processor or text program.
Co-operation is an element that has gained many improvements within the application programs: Excel is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text programme, each collaborator is assigned a single color to comments to make clear identification in the revision phase.
Some companies also work on transferring some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and they should end the final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version that is located on the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for Linux operating system.
The installation cd can also be sent home or to workplace on request.
And if the issue of freeness can be a challenge to expand in homes, the Open Office pack has a lot of bets on the business area, and can already count on the various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there are no training, consulting and assistance services that are ideal for SMEs, which can open business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer for video writing substituting Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphic model.
The goal of 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and when considering that we are nearly 3 million and 600 thousand to date, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this predicted number can be overcome.
Kohl’s results are also positive, it’s the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: Rakušana Bernharda Kohl, from Gerolsteiner's team, the third classified and the winner of the best top shirt.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive racer on Ceru, Epo of the third generation, after Italy Riccard Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, too, from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl’s blood samples are among those that have been performed in the last weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry labs.
If the control analysis confirms the positiveness of Cera, Rakušan will lose third place in the Tour and will have to face the two-year disqualification fixed.
The Kol positive report on the third generation of Epo confirms the head of the French antidoping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced Associated Press that he had already informed Austrian governments of the outcome.
26-year-old Rakušan placed himself on the degree winner behind Spain by Carlos Sastrem and American Cadel Evansema, and also gained a pointed shirt of the best top.
IMmigrants: New York Times Is THE WORLD, IS ITALIAN RASSIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants only turned into a priority target of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
This is the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkiny Faso, who was killed last month in Milan because he stole a dry box.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as a "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work is recorded", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
In order to confirm the rising tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the Lega, which attempts to brake immigration and facilitate the relief of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of climate change in Italy.
The trend emphasizes both the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together on the defeat of racism.”
Students with the victims of expensive rents - up to €900 per room
The lease market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to recent research from Sunia, the leasers' trades, renting a single room can stand up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already achieved such dimensions that all the layer of students lost their right to study due to the overall too high prices that their families should tolerate," explains Laura Mariani, the leading studio office for Sunia, in this city, a large demand by the students has deformed the market in such a way that they have undergone the price process."
In most cases, the rental offer includes several offences: contracts freely, unregistered, without limited lease, associated with lease.
Sunji needs an exceptional intervention that can regulate prices thanks to the tax review.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, one bed is needed about 450 euros, a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence, an average one bed is 350/400 euros, one room is about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the university, you need €250/280 per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 double beds in a double bed.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We only save if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for one-bedroom Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples there are EUR 300/450 for bed, EUR 400 to 600 for room, with the highest prices in Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, they want 250/350 euros for bed, at least 350 for single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where it is the most common phenomenon rentable for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally another anomalie: an increase of about 25-30% of the fees they want for foreign students compared to Italians.
Bye to the old movie Paradiso, cities break historic halls
The cinematographic historic halls are closed in the interests of Multiplex.
"A city without movies is like a blind man, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore documents successfully what is happening in large Italian city centres and also rural cities.
The process of restriction of films, the birth of large multisalas in the outskirts and the subsequent destruction of monosalas in central areas of the city, is one of the events that appear to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all signs of real cultural crime.
"It's as if we were about a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of travel and a lot of emotions," says the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that 20 years ago won to the Tornator Oscar and a great prize of the court in Cannes for life.
The values obtained by Anece, the leading association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed doors, and the highest account has paid mostly halls in the most important cities: about 10 min in Florence, about 9 min in Milan, Torí, about 6 min in Naples, and Bologna.
Among the most disabled regions, Emilia-Romagna is first with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And the proof that the first one responsible for their displacement is the multiplex occurrence, are the three Italian regions that recorded the highest number of new cinema multisalas: 195 more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in both Toscana and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian process has developed unrationally," says President Paolo Protti, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing survive because when one movie in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then, let’s not talk about insufficient grants to the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From the moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Aid to the sector would be needed between 16 and 18 million euros per year.”
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city that is concerned with the closures and decided to find an eastern signature of the protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy to protect and promote small films in both historical centres and in the prefecture.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax reduction in the interests of operators and the benefits of the public with regard to mobility: viewers will be able to wind into a limited transport zone and will have special prices to stop and on some parking spaces.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologne by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to resist the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more challenging.
Defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: closing a Super cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and teenager, was a certain thing that convinced me to create "New Cinema Paradiso", which I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before the already closed Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I shared so many emotions that I don’t have to look at black dust’s letters, I turn to the other side.”
The link between politics and the Mafia group 'ndrangheta', Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The oldest of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the city office according to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia group."
The charges against Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgio e Rosario Schiavone and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew of lawyers, the chief name, already accused of committing Mafia crimes, was sentenced to paying €10 million.
"They have ignored all legal and moral standards as well as a healthy sense," state prosecutors wrote when two local governments expressed their willingness to pay advice to the lawyer Piromallim.
“This would allow the Mafia group to officially enter the municipal offices and facilitate so huge possibilities of control and management of public administration.”
Agazio Loiero, Chairman of the Caliber Regional Commission, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organized criminal subconscious are much in his country: "There are areas in which the mafia concentration is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndranghetes, heroes who are still unrestrained'.
Today's morning imprisonment follows after the imprisonment from July last year, by which the police showed that the Piromalli Mafia group had received a final intervention.
Since the end of April last year, the Municipal Council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, and the reason was then the expected link between organized crime and local government was released by local politicians in the municipal government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the coalition of the right Wednesday after the narrow election in May.
He cried for the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of the then Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of having it all for political reasons, but judges in the imprisonment regulation signed this morning explain that the Mafia group has even reached so far as to request a change in road A3.
From other hearings to Dal Torriono, the public prosecutor wrote, "the desire to move the rights of entrepreneurs, representatives of some larger groups very close, as it is generally known, Piromallimu, and to adapt public administration elections to the Mafia group's interests."
When energy comes from waves, these big ones enter the game.
It is an infinite bed that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and now begins to discover large global energy companies.
The waves, flows, flows, influences are the new sources of inexhaustible energy, which have been enlarged by the sight of the colons such as Chevron, who is now trying to draw hands on these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years and in the 1970s in connection with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices fell around the 1980s, the idea of sea energy use went to the side. But now ecological organizations and new increases in oil prices gave the sector a new impulse.
In 2007, the World Energy Council (WEC) announced that around 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by sea waves movement.
This amount would be a double energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
There are also flows and flows.
Turn off the attacks.
The company that invested in sea energy was Enersis, who agreed in 2005 to build plants in northern Portugal.
When this purpose was declared, it seemed a huge revolutionary step.
After two years, more and more companies are putting on sea energy than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” said a spokesman of a company linked to the U.S. oil colony, in the Wall Street Journal’s economic daily newspapers, and they think about the possibility of working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering is to obtain authorisation from the U.S. Energy Commission necessary for the departure of the project for the use of sea energy in Alaska.
We can’t underestimate this signal, especially when we take into account that in Alaska, the United States continues to enjoy oil and President Bush has recently arrived with a plan for a new welding.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amounts invested, although not known in detail, show increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about technology, which is still at the beginning, because they don’t know what impact marine energy will have on the environment.
Currently, equipment in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and does not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
For more energy production, however, it is necessary to use technology with a greater impact on the dissemination.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a fighting system that is connected to each other.
The power of the wave, which moves with the fights up and down, is changed with the help of wheels and cylinders on the hydraulic pressure inside these fears.
Pressure pushes the turbine that delivers energy to the generator.
Energy is available on the coast of the submarine cables.
Currently, there are four projects of this type that are waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could serve for military purposes.
Verdant Power is now producing energy for shopping malls and parking lots using six submarine turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the flood and dilution causes the rotation of turbines that the generator is living by this rotating movement.
Verdant expressed that they have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisation due to the possibility of using this energy.
In the waves, in the flood and in the flood.
In this moment, special interest deserves the potential of inflation and dilution, the Institute for Electrical Research said.
Although this is an independent factor, flow and inflation are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
Just in the energy flow and displacement of states such as New York, Maine and Aljaska, and with other coastal states, they already invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
