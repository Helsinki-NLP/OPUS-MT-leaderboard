What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "conditorey".
The new councillors of the capital from the lines of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once a little "closed" members of the new council from the ČSSD, as it has dominated the Notorian snake, who has embedded in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on ruder.
The encoded vocabulary, which was introduced by the political elite of Prague in the flooded era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new councils in terms of these new concepts are somewhat in the dark.
At least they claim that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a newlywed in Prague policy," Lukáš Kaucký, the new cultural adviser, responded to the test of the "Paten Wordschats".
But also the Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded similarly.
For example, the term "golf hole".
“This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use again and again.”
Otherwise, I don’t like a lot of snake.”
From the vocabulary published by the journal Aktuálně.cz in June before the ODS election congress, the editor picked out six terms, especially those that are notably associated with the Prague Magistrate.
Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "Great Prague Gulf Hole", "Go to the Conditorey", "Stiernacken", "Betrayal of the capital" and "remaining".
Three Prague ratters agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future chief of the Prague schools - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take away the listener.
The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the front.
“These things don’t matter to me and how the civil Democrats are talking to each other, I don’t judge them.”
“It’s important for me how we understand each other within our programs,” he said.
As already mentioned, Lukáš Kaucký in the above-mentioned headline claimed not to recognize that the speech of the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing, and the only term he correctly erected during the test was "the largest Prague Gulf hole".
“That’s the Blanka tunnel,” Kaucký said, but added to the security: “But I know it rather from the newspaper.”
And funny: "I'll probably have to show a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Environmental Councillor Lukáš Plachý as the Blanka Tunnel.
However, both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and thus what it means to “go to the conditorey”.
“I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business,” Plachý is quite close to the mystery solution when you know that it is the headquarters of Janoušeks companies.
However, in accordance with Březina, he insists that this knowledge be created more from the newspaper than that the word would be his own.
To judge the test participants, in fact, there is no similarly civic snake among the Social Democrats.
“I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there’s nothing like that with us.”
"We call at the name, then and again we also use short or top names," said the president of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party's salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Březa (birke), but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that," Karel Březina told us his top name.
The journal Deník Aktualmente.cz has tried the name and see da - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party members of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Elder", the representative Miroslav Poche, who made attention to himself before the elections by make-ups at the party sponsoring, is called "Igráček" by some colleagues (known Czech Lego figure).
The main names are the only thing that allows the Social Democrats to use in-party languages.
Hulínský does not claimed to be called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another name of the President of Prague.
His top name "Doctor of the Rubber Candle Rights" is allegedly related to the acquisition of Petr Hulínský's title Doctor Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and issue a brochure
Women in Burkina Faso to witches usually have some common social features.
They belong rather to the older generation, they don’t find work – for example for health reasons, they are empty and have no children.
When one of these women becomes witch, it is strictly isolated so that it cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women keep this savings as they help and give birth to children at work," an ordinary sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state, Burkina Faso, in a special home, taking care of more than a hundred women issued by their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason, he issued a brochure that would stop the "heavy persecution".
But the thing has a hack.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of written explanation.
The witchcraft, however, is also going and going in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they left them with oil and simply tied them.
This incident was reported by the BBC server.
However, the criminals claimed that the matter would have been just a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is deflated, which is used for ritual salt.
And that, after the group has tried to "expel a bad spirit" out of the woman.
The insulation of "hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The Standard" cited a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Sirs of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least seeks to strive for the witch hunt, the president of the Gambia had a good mix of the president himself last year.
“President Yahya Jammeh discovered a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt’s death, as they allegedly had a share of their deaths and now would try to kill the president himself by black magic.”
"That's what he called on Shaman from near Guinea to help the women and men who were unpleasantly arrested, accompanied by policemen, soldiers, and the president's guard, were forced to take away from the Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the enclosed people were forced to drink an absurd from plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only due to international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were re-released.
A renter in Bakala: He is warming in the oven - still paying higher rentals
An older man just leaves the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kolebarons" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czech Republic.
Under the arm a map with three new rental contracts for three houses: for the own and the houses of his daughters and of his son, who has just put a jail punishment.
All three were in the context of the so-called "deregulation" just increased the rent.
Rather than renting 3500 Krones monthly, the son is expected to rent a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 Krones next year.
"And there's not even flowing hot water in the apartment and you need to heat in a simple coal furnace," he suggests with his finger on the new son's rental contract, whose signature he has a power.
"But what - I signed," he explained half vote and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which referred to the new rental conditions as "wrong and immoral", advises the renters simply not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7 to publish a guide to how to deal against such contracts.
But the man only turns off.
“One says that, the other says that,” he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava becomes a major "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is predecessor of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose renters have not yet paid for market-right rentals.
Currently.cz decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG warter in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already at nine in the morning is full of breaking.
Just next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device are there.
"Lease 2011", so a special keyboard lights on the touch screen.
Shortly hit and the device already smuggles a number.
We have uncovered the number "157" and already pitched it on the large display on the ceiling of the Warterroom.
Half a second later, you're on the row.
Something later, an older couple enters the Warteraum to ask for rent, but the storm in the Warteraum does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance issues and so on.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the Kuverts with the new rental contracts are most of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio in the postal boxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a lease increase of about 15 to 38% in their letters.
The special switch for new rentals in the customer center has been opened since November 18th.
"The action runs a little over a week, i.e., it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch reply after a moment of hesitation when the "client" appears as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala’s former mountain labour apartments are a brief topic.
Before the elections, Parliamentary Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek, originating in Ostrava, had taken this issue quite loudly by the ČSSD, and it is no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“For twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"Nothing ever, toilet bricks could change them," said the first mentioned man air.
Until now, according to the employees, the pensioners are mainly on the switch to make sure they will actually receive the promised rent discount that RPG promises to them when they sign the special offer in time.
For the enjoyment of a half-discounted February rental, the other renters who sign the new rental contract will also come up until December 15th.
Until now, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is all other than overloaded by demands.
"Of the 360 customers yesterday, only about 40 to 50 were hired in 2011 because of here," the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites and wall tables where necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rental, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG said on its website.
“No one goes to court here,” one of RPG Byty’s employees says, and a man on the street before the customer center at least partially gives her right.
“I have 13,000 (crones) pensions, of which I will remain 5,000 for food, where I should take the money for a court dispute,” he said.
Then the employees will be uncertain.
"Mal see."
"The Lord Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so wait for the people," she says.
The regulated lease ends mostly in the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty says the lease increase is an economic need.
“The current amount of lease is not enough to maintain the housing fund,” Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty, argues, and – just the negligence of the housing fund criticized by the hired renters is the main reason for the lease.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it was expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years between 2011 and 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling against the pole seats in the Warterroom of Havířov, there are always a few red-lighting information.
“The lease increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG apartments.”
"It always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," it is read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase the rental by 38%.
"In these cases, it is the rise of extremely low lease prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rental remains at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not step up the lease, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company is committed to another commitment: all revenues from the rental increase (see chart) the company wants to get back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and in the heat reduction.
But - first of all, these people should benefit those who sign the lease agreements.
The architects looked at - the office also included a childhood garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would already expect a mini-child garden here, with all that includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing space on the outdoor terrace.
This child garden has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architectural office Arch.Design, whose workshops are derived from a whole series of namely brown buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the spaces for its company mining gardens.
In a smarter perspective, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are at the babyboom age and the company is based on the project’s architects returning to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of working shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus to offer the Arch.Design to its employees in the concept of their social program.
Building engineers and architects make it easier to put their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design’s employees, and with the support of management, they managed to earn funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social for their project.
The operational mini-child garden is financed by the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidy of 2,8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment were obtained and provided for the duration of 2 years for qualified staff and operations.
After the exploitation of the grants (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue the mini-kind garden at its own expense for another 3 years.
The preparation of this project took place a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing strong assistance in solving the application.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And as it comes to a mini-children garden, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but several children change each day.
The child garden is flexiblely adapted to the needs of the parents, children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the child garden - without regard to the company's hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-child garden is comparable to the framework programme for pre-education.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also given excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, and they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative toys, but also with a computer that is available to children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, so the stress is lost when delayed to pick up the children from a remote childhood.
Parents use their working time more productively.
It is not surprising that there are natural and loyal employer-employed relationships.
Arch.Design has become part of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the promotion of new employees, family-friendly and strengthening their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof muts like the back of a prehistoric axle, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are uplifted fish mouse.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the so-called residents, the house with its organic forms received the top name " bone house".
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, coal splits and mosaics, the fasces reminding of screws and all-new soft lines, all these are typical characteristics of the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamy lines, sharp colors and textures that remind nature and living beings.
Only in a more accurate manner can be noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the entire facade appears even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same vibrant lines and stretched forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wavely shaped wood copys the window frames, walls, ceiling elements of doors, and even holes and leathers.
The Batlló House in the Eixample neighborhood on the live shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the construction of a house from 1877, executed by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the breakdown of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but he finally agreed to Gaudí’s idea for an unusual and even cheaper construction.
However, the rental house Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on its sheet board the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the façade was his idea.
However, in the design of the façade, many other artists and artists also worked with.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the Güell Park, where further works of Antoni Gaudí are also included.
Shortly after its completion, the house was received from the so-called residents of its organic forms because of the top name "kneeshaus".
Others, on the other hand, called the special window opening mechanism because of the "current house".
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia, is represented at the top of the building.
But other imaginary elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house for that time with ventilation channels and typical stones.
Something strange is already muting her 45-degree tendency.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at that time and did not let any of them go.
Before the construction began, he received the corresponding construction authorisation from the city, but the information made by him about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city ancestors two years later were so disturbed by the result that they requested correction.
The consulars, among other things, argued that the construction with its pillars even interfered with the public citizenship.
However, there were no changes, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the city district's invitation, Josep Batlló filed an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was immediately issued to him.
The house owner himself went into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was a company hall, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was covered in a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes a stairs up to the rooftop.
Through the basic elements of the umbaus, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by bogged and screwed walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked with a modern concept of mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the hall doors, and thus a larger society could be comfortable, without having to give up some intimity during more confidential conversations.
The house also received a fairly unusual roof and two other floors by means of Gaudí’s reconstruction, besides a new facade.
Gaudí’s game is also impressive with the light, as well as the blue and white glassed shells with which the inner courtyard is covered and the light heights.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum level of light to all floors of the house.
He simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited today by anyone.
On the first floor, the spacious and most beautiful apartment is made available to the public.
The house owners decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When you found that this is a fairly unnecessary business, you kept the visits, yes, you also extend them to further shared floors and rooftops, including the rooftops.
However, the price for visiting the building is not a papystiel, it is EUR 16.50, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist exhibitions get 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed brush? Women have other desires than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattresses and ross make the good bed out.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to meet the desires of the concrete user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, size, health condition, and not least the gender of the sleeper.
Also important is the interior, where mattress and ross have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house in which it is not regularly heated, latex extracts are not well suited as they take a lot longer to "heat".
In addition, they are significantly more severe than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
For if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core, and still lie on a solid plate, moisture depends: so it is not excluded to form under their shelf.
Of course, in the election, it also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, can hardly get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"While all Eishockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their discharged shoulders, curves and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco shade (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
“I recommend this, among other things, people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system so that they can get the “information” from the joints and skin poorly,” explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in poster furniture.
That’s why I’ve been taking care of many Eishockey players years ago, but also other customers with these mattresses with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem because such matraces offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily need to be a famous eishockey player to learn the benefits of the Visco shade.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise it regularly stirs up on the warm body.
Not at all, you don’t get around at night like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
In addition, the viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (woundbrand).
When choosing the mattress size, the length of the foot salts should still be added to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm long need a bed of 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the beds should be available at least 90 cm wide, thus 180 cm together.
In single beds, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
Half of comfort and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rules apply to the ideal bed width: "When you are on your back, there should be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the first master of the poster and space exhibitor, who has been focused on the problems of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for years.
In a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattresses, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else is left than mounting the rope at different heights and this is not long possible in any bed bed.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeletons should be 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be removed from the shape layer and the fine belt.
“Don’t feel the feathers by hand or by seating,” Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of roast.
Fully tapered beds with mattress and subscription such as adult siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be aired and the relationship cannot be washed, which is already going on today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 l in a single night, it is clear that the mattress becomes a giant (and stirred seven) slowly after five to seven years.
For this reason, professionals refuse advertising loans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in matras, even lifetime warranty.
Every thing has her when and yet.
And therefore, a practical advice from traders: when mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not disturb the hygiene of the washable, removable bonds, yet it is recommended to use a mattress scanner that can be easily removed and washed.
Although today usually mattresses are made with round-circuit seal, so that after opening you get two halfs (immensely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, mainly carried out alone, often like the inequaliable struggle between David and Goliath.
Did they have a solid plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get out of here!
Or at the top for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Also, they should prefer to provide the plate with ventilation holes (unless they are already in it) and use mattresses with feather skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called bag feather cores and fine belts.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a subscription.
For non-adjustable latex rods with 14 to 18 latex rods (latex or sandwich mattresses) are suitable (including combinations of latex and cocoa), latex rods are always paid with a larger number of latex rods, i.e. from 28 and more latex rods, with lords support in the latex rod area and the possibility of regulating the late hardness.
Adjustable lamella rods do not include mattresses with feather skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic version.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the feeders, special flexible shoulder modules are also provided.
This involves a special attachment of the brackets, which allows the brackets to be printed or even angled in such a way that they allow the punctual insinuation of the shoulder of the bracket.
Namely for men with broad shoulders is an important thing.
There are even matrix manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area at "matrix matrix".
The ladies are also thought - they are given these soft sons in the hill area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing fiber systems (Lattoflex) or roste with point elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion fiber.
The pressure is distributed into several points, reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) headbag for the right mattress and the right roast, most of the benefits are lost again.
Also here is a lawn rule: the headbag should support the head, its tops should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a 50 x 60 cm large kidney, like Scandinavian for example, appears.
In the side position, the headbag (together with the shoulder load zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the incoming (with Heu filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Also in matratzen, the new magic word "Bio".
Instead of oil raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane shells more and more frequently natural oils - for example rice and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the core of matraces, which consists of materials of purely natural origin," says Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, microcapsules can also be used that spread fresh forest or lavendel fragrance when sleeping.
There is also a difference between a man and a woman.
While in men a "coolinger" plant extract is used from birch leaves to allow the matrace ratio to absorb the heat and cool the body, the matraces for women have a "heating" effect.
Extracts from red potatoes rain the blood circulation, so the weaker gender becomes good warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (he has larger pores with broken cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the various stitches (hard) of cold shells and visco shells, multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where are heads, hips and rods.
However, for a high-quality matrace you have 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT as they are considered to be medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was awarded this advantage.
You can see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
There are special offers from manufacturers and traders that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
This is how the Magniflex brand offers the matrace Duofreeze with hidden Visco-Schum Memory for 11,990 CZK in reference.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
Not surprisingly, they were designed for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it is back in hardening.
Thus it perfectly adapts to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
Therefore, it is not only ideal for preventing pressure burning, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viskoelastic foams, however, are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot posters, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have children under control
The fear of growing up their own children, thus increasingly considering parents to monitor them by GPS.
The system originally invented for cars can also locate people as well, which would be helpful in such cases as in the recent unforgettable disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is now about as large as a cigarette box, but soon it is probably not bigger than a bracelet clock.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and fear, thus keeping them in the way of means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We strive to say to everyone that this is not about spying on heroes, but to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," Petr Pilin from company Macro Weil, one of the providers of GPS location devices in the Czech market.
“I admit that in a single case, abuse of such devices can come, for example, when someone puts it in the pocket without knowing it, but we haven’t had to record such a case so far.”
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
However, children’s psychologist Dana Bočková suggests that if a child does not wear such a thing, it simply eliminates him.
“Very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing some things intentionally if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"While the phones were awakening great expectations from parents at first, they can be as easily disabled as these new monitoring devices," says Mrs. Bočková.
You also think it's controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"With planned kidnapping, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
“If such monitoring devices find broader use, they would also look for them as their sales would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising.”
“In these cases, police criminals are always a step forward,” the psychologist says.
However, she agrees that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech by RC Monitoring, the location services offer both for automobiles and for people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a thread knife is integrated, i.e. if you fall and remain unmovable, the device immediately sends a warning by indicating the position," Mr. Čech claimed.
According to him, similar services could also perform smart phones with navigation, you only need to play a special software.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either about devices in wooden box sizes, similar to supporters or smaller phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil, there are devices that look like normal digital watches tested in the present time.
“This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he realizes that only after a certain time, which gives the police a timeline," he added.
No matter what direction the development goes - to arms or stickers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle location.
So for the combination of location function using the GPS system (as with Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many sweats that you can turn around the whole Czech Republic but keep you only two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of floods, with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of sundschnur to the army camp.
It is quiet to know that the army has been out for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of swelling nuts - two, but not more than four years.
The Army purchased the STV Group stock companies for 40 million lipic crowns.
In its grounds for the purchase of this huge amount of sulfur, the General Staff MF DNES responded that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometres of sulfur per year.
According to the investigations of military pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES responded to this statement, the entire army should carry out an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year – from all generals and officers of the military command, to the secretaries and puzzle women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only this is how the significant annual consumption of sixty kilometers of flame nuts could be justified by halfway.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
However, this would be the case for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that each new vocational soldier is sufficient to train two meters, then through these new purchases, even in the light of the growing needs of pioneers and special units, the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned.
Soldiers of the quick use brigade have recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra, they almost no longer had patrons for hand guns, so shooting exercises are strongly limited due to the lack of means.
The shortage of underwear is quiet.
“I don’t know why they buy such a lot of noises from us.”
But that’s finally their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer we want to meet as a dealer," said Jan Děcký, distributor of the STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur with the army had covered it for at least ten years with this "munition".
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, only speaks of a four-year duration of the fireworks and police and army pyrotechnician for only two years.
"In perfect storage, the four mentioned years may also be possible," one of them agrees, but one who wants to remain nominated, to not be criticized as a soldier of the army.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not threatening the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not free, but cost additional money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of Snooze.
“They cost us sixty percent less than the last year’s delivery of 244 kilometers,” Speaker Pejšek told us the position of the Defence Ministry’s buyers.
Only for comparison: Annual consumption of firearms by police pyrotechnicians, liquidating ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army, has been almost over 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of these ammunition that they can consume before the expiry of the duration of use.
Because of the safety of pyrotechnicians, there is also the possibility of more flexible purchasing and therefore more reliable swelling.
However, the Ministry of Defense has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand heads of the Czechoslovakia People's Army were preparing for their field trip to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, MF DNES, the Czech army expects the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers old flames that she has purchased today so "inexpensively".
To date, I have the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition.
The winning placement in the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" has helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last decade of the competition "Little Entrepreneur of the Year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scenario.
I'm glad you're looking for a trip.
Only abroad he became aware that there is no reasonable price at a good night stay in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and using a bank loan, he built a building house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a high school student at that time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a brave intercourse.
“The price-quality ratio at that time irritated me and so I tried to do something against that,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rebuilt apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits back into the house, which he then took step by step to retirement with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the Four Star Hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé to which we sold our Franchise concept and other stakeholders in the Franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already signed up," the entrepreneur number one said last year.
"A large part of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just won the competition "Commercials of the year," Mr. Pytloun acknowledged.
The victory has brought him greater popularity, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"People recognized me on the road, often they even congratulated me later and I have to say that it did well," he recalls.
I really recommend to everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don’t need to win at the same time, every kind of vision is good.
He says he has benefited from the contacts and knowledge to this day, which otherwise it would not have come to.
“With some people I met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relationships so far.”
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also slightly falls on each of his employees.
And there he has the seventy.
“I note greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that will be awarded to general recognition.”
I don’t really see this as a personal success, no, it’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name is just a bit in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun.
My followers I wish a calmer year than we had it in farm
The victory euphoria was quickly dismantled from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its goal-travel, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone competition last year received Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At that time, the jury respected the efforts with which he broke out a company from the ground from the small tools construction in Česká Skalice, making hundreds of millions of turnovers.
“I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only me but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-confidence in fighting competition,” the winner said.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the state of his father, Karel Žďárský, as compensation for the property taken by the Communists, offered a small workshop to the pact, he did not hesitate long, left his career in the company, where he had been busy until that time, sausing and founding with a few companions of his father's own company for the manufacture of plastic vehicles.
Shortly afterwards, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to be the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the competition mentioned and its medialization, it has also entered into the awareness of non-speciality.
"Not only that our customers now perceive the brand Farmet significantly more intensively, our foreign partners also began to work together with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country," Karel Žďárský says.
Last year, however, Farmet was not just a sign of victory euphoria.
The evaluation was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of tools.
The crisis, which at that time even less affected the citizens, but especially the companies, just reached their point of view - many companies were forced to terminate their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation.”
"The sales declined by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even get rid of releases," Karel Žďárský said.
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to handle the situation and keep the company in the black numbers, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to make a breakthrough - in investments in research and development.
“With the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired main prizes at domestic exhibitions,” says Žďárský.
All of this shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"To the new winner I wish a lot of joy in victory - but in a quiet atmosphere," Karel Žďárský said.
An opinion survey that addresses unfair rules
The opinion survey on the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurial competition.
Some uncertain rules have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
As a doubtful winner of the next year's opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the duty to create documents to authorities that are available online.
So more than a third of not totally four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social insurance administration requested a paper withdrawal from the trade register, even if the official had been able to obtain it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion survey, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extractions from the trade register in the future when checking social insurance payers," said the spokesman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all the regulations and orders under the loops that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply and to revoke those inconsistent.
This year, for the fourth time, is part of an entrepreneurial competition that is organized by the Economic Journal (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder corporate activity.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading rank in the world," Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and businessmen of the Czech Republic notes.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activities has been the pronounced goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has failed to improve.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, compared to the previous year, one of eight places worse.
The Competition Absurdity of the Year was released for the first time in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
The website www.firmaroku.cz serves to log in. After that, the organizer of the competition seeks seven candidates for the "Anti-Price" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that most votes get.
For this year's opinion survey, more than one hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and arrangements have already been reported.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles must pay Maut for highways and fastways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must conduct every two years.
The list of "Seven" this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The cancellation of the competition at the Prague Wenzel Square at the beginning of November is part of a happening, which regularly also involves personalities of political and public life.
For example, this year, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the top of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs into the legs, there can be no real economic rise, so it is my goal to withdraw at least thirty paragraphs every year, which are still unnecessaryly harshing entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unsatisfactory orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, people mostly disrupted the duty imposed by entrepreneurs to have to report to the entrepreneur in place of their permanent office three days in advance the intention of going to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This duty was repealed by a newly established trade law.
The duty to receive the second-largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report service trips of employees within up to 30 days - was abolished by the so-called Green Card Act on them.
All good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed by physiotherapeutics was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two individual weights in the speech room.
This Regulation has been somewhat reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation for the refrigerator has fallen away.
A new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sport projects
One of the new ones in the fifth year of the competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "The Responsible Companies of 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair entrepreneurship.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafon’s mobile broadcasting company, is the caller and guarantee of this competition, as well as the “Rebel of the Year” competition.
This year’s first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafon main competition company, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each one of them is extremely inspiring and bad enough substance for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in relation to the subject of their activity, their efforts still have a common nominee - support and consideration.
For example, this is about people with disabilities because of personal problems or the health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region of Pardubice is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for children with disabilities for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Poděbrady also, for example, takes care of their healthily disabled employees, who represent 70 percent of their employees, which was awarded the title "responsible company of the region medium bohemian"; in the competition Vodafone company of the year, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, among other things, a flowing and, in addition, reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week without a proportional reduction in wage.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment as low as possible," said Miluše Ryznarová, CEO.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is also located on the health of its employees, and therefore has acquired ergonomic chairs and keyboards to all of their laptops, as well as promotes their employees' homework and in corporate promotions it uses cartering services provided by a native-protected workshop.
“In addition, we support the “People in Emergency” Foundation that provides concrete assistance to the Roma community,” says Ondřej Suchý, representative of the company.
Lastly, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We make contributions to our employees to care, workplace, improve their qualifications and for vacation," says Josef Strapáč, from the constructed company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch-Schlesische region.
To the category Responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the year were automatically reported, which responded to the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the registration and gave it to the organizer by 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competitors left the questions unresponsive, they were excluded from the competition "responsible company of the year", but they were not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone company of the year."
“A separate registration for this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the year’s main competition company,” explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose agency.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests at a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have taken arrests in the last days.
The media dealer and real estate dealer Luboš G. was conducted by the detectives in hand shelves.
He claimed that he had attempted to manipulate a just held public competition to address refund claims in such a way that the grounds offered in the competition would benefit a concrete stakeholder.
Luboš G. has paid half a million.
"During this time, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person in a public competition due to the offense of fraudulent machinations," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner State Prosecutor's "Právo" newspaper, could not give her further details in terms of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
In what way he was able to manipulate public competition, you can only speculate about it, in view of the spear official information.
The spokeswoman of the ground fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police actually arrested in the Pilsner side of the ground fund, and this took place during a public competition.
"It was a customer and didn't participate in one of our employees," she concreted.
According to Mrs. Černá, the public competition had the correct name "An invitation to offer claims for the transfer of land lands under the ground law" and would take place in cases where several applicants demonstrate interest in the land offered.
"These individuals offer, as part of the invitation, a higher value of their reimbursement claims to be compensated by the transfer than the value of the property issued."
"In accordance with the proposed claims, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," the spokesman of the fund explains.
Luboš G. was obviously available information on who had logged in on the request and since he himself was a eligible person as he had purchased a number of refund claims, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat invention.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner ground fund in the past.
Thus, he also played a role in the cause of the former head of the ground fund Václav Sankota, which was criminally pursued because he exhibited in replacement parcels that had already been accepted local decisions on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also acquired grounds intended to build public streets, more precisely at the place where the construction of the access magistery was planned to the commercial area of Borské pole.
Later, he exchanged them very conveniently with the magistrate against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which much exceeded the value of the property.
At that time, the councillor had to give a heavy heart to the small pearls, in order not to threaten the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household costs increase by a few hundred per month
Households have to expect not only higher costs for all energy species from January, but also higher water and waste water fees, and for remote heat and somewhere the rentals are also growing.
As of January, families will have to withdraw more than one hundred crowns a month from the portfolio than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6% more expensive, gas up to 2% and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in some places the remote heat supply is also distorted.
Only the electricity control costs the housing budgets a few hundred krones more per year.
The power prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so it is due to the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic plants.
Gas will only be moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here, too, you can expect a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive in the entire Czech Republic, the prices of remote heat vary from city to city.
In particular, larger places plan to increase prices.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more than 50 krones per month for remote heat from January, and more than 1000 krones per year for families in Liberec.
Prague’s residents, however, are at risk of 9 percent higher water and wastewater fees, in the event that the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rent doesn’t change, it’s only 6.8%.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest in comparison to the whole Czech Republic.
In North Bohemian, where prices are now one of the highest, water and waste water fees are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, enormous lease prices are expected in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called lease regulation falls away from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rentals by hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this rental increase wants the company to be in court interest.
The regulated rentals, which are still paying nearly 300,000 apartments today, will likely increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drinking with remnet and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Faret, Rum and Wodka, also exceptionally, a good whisky you stole your father from the housebar.
These are the beverages that the most commonly need to be treated by drunken Czech teens under fifteen.
There are no exceptions to children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is based on the experience of doctors facing similar cases in the inclusion of children’s departments from clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you’re drunk.”
“Today’s trend is obviously harder alcohol,” said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head of the children’s department at the Hořovice Mediterranean clinic.
"Whisky, if it manages to remove a bottle from the housebar to the father, and if not, then at least away or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," the chief doctor explains.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"The most common thing is about remnet or rum."
"That's the current alcohol trend, particularly in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz that you took from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drunkards have not been an exception for long.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he worked since this year, he worked in the pediatric department of the Motol Hospital for ten years, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from near and far.
“A girl had to be hospitalized four times.”
"Your career began at the age of 12 when she was first introduced with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase"," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition area in Holešovice at any dance party."
“It was interesting that her mother didn’t even surprise her daughter to come home for 48 hours,” the chief physician asked.
The lack of parental interest or their incredible tolerance in injury with their own speakers is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a true dependence in the real sense of the word does not work in children.
Under alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and that is not the case in these children.
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” said Pelikán.
According to the hospital spokesman Motol, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunken children were invited to the Department of Child and Youth Medicine until mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that made a hospital stay requires are included in the statistics.
Drink children that are taken home by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police, after an ambulance treatment will not be registered.
Except in cases where children only drink such a bottle of snaps in the school bank, Mr. Pelikán believes there are three seasonal amplitudes on which one hundred percent leaves: Walpurgissnight, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The last call for two reasons - either for distress for the bad testimony or for joy for the holidays."
"In the Walpurgis night, I also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxally better than a child who only struggles with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headache in the morning, resulting from dehydration and glucose angle, can be discharged in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion with glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"They're clearly better than after the "Great" experience in the evening, they wake up with good noise, without any pain."
“They’re just a bit confused about where they are,” says Dr. Pelikán, at least sometimes depriving the patient of the good laughs by paying them the costs that they will cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed comes well and enjoys a few hundred thousand crowns.
"He and I used it as an educational remedy once and again when I calculated the children directly at the visit, what has cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work over all the holidays to earn money for one of these fats," Dr. Pelikán added.
However, in his opinion, the hospitals do not undertake regression procedures to demand the costs necessary for the healing of drunk children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged against transport aircraft Casa C-295M were flying to the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
So far, they were only seen at manövers or flight shows.
This is the flying two-seat version L-159T1 operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircraft are united L-159.
These are currently stored in Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
When they physically expedite the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The single fighter aircraft L-159 were excluded from long-term aircraft, which was without further deposits and investments from the ministry's resort.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," Peychek told the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army will not have to leave without two-seat fighting aircraft as the Defense Ministry signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four overflows L-159 to two-seat version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second would take over it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to implementing combat aircraft into the equipment of one of NATO countries.
“The contract is clear and clear that the company is EADS customers of the aircraft L-159 and that it is intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
“It is therefore the customer’s case in what way he realizes the matter,” Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of other planes for 3.5 billion Krones was yet to be approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defense had then not written a tender procedure to purchase, but spoke directly to EADS.
The defence office at that time argued that this exchange will support the future exports of L-159 to abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, and wanted to sell the rest.
In addition, the purchase of the aircraft Casa may also have a judicial succession.
The European Commission appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice, which is why the aircraft should have been selected as a result of a whole-European tender and should not participate in response to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken three aircraft Casa, the last to land on the airport Kbely within fourteen days.
A longer finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This should be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is particularly in men up to sixty,” said Ros Eeles, co-author of the study, professor at the University of Warwick’s Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily be subjected to a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in the UK pursued more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the display finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was considered as for 19 percent of men whose ring and fingers were equally long.
However, in men whose fingers were longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33%, in men up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already forming at the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone has accelerated the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK was familiar with this study, yet he considered the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to date not "completely proven".
Czechs in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and walkways is mostly fixed snow, the winter service providers were manyrorts on axis all night.
The D5 highway between 89 and 90 kilometers towards Rozvadov is closed for some accidents of trucks and truck and also the D1 at Brno to Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Automotive Club (ÚAMK).
At 91km, a truck crashed, at 93km, two trucks collapsed, injured.
A few cars are also in the streets.
There are also problems at 185 kilometers of the D1 highway towards Prague.
There are also two trucks together here.
The drivers should go right behind Brno at 190 kilometers or drive Brno at 182 kilometers at Kývalka.
There are kilometers long stains.
Also on the D11, an accident occurred, and that’s exactly what happened on arrival to Prague.
In Prague itself, a several centimeter thick snowboard is located and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car colonies form in the town of Prosek, as well as the street Štěrboholská is completely closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trains run with delays, for example, on the line between Karlsplatz and Peaceplatz.
At 8:00 a.m. the Prague Crisis Staff is meeting.
There are also problems at the railway and airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snowfalls.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kingupy or even Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should definitely be informed of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.
Most of the roads in Southern Maurity are only accessible with increased caution.
For Vyškov, three sideways are totally in danger, in the vicinity of Brno there are apparently snowfalls, and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snowfalls on some highways.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three streets still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Also here you will need to use snowflakes.
When they are re-accessible, it cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, the White Carpathians are cautious.
On the streets, which can be distributed only with inner streams for natural protection, a thick snow cover of up to five centimeters, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most of which in northern bohemians - estimated to be up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mauritius-Schleschian region, snow fell up to 15 centimeters.
In the Czech Republic, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The U.S. troops have used a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known to date only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and move the force ratio to its benefit.
The new weapon is something like a super precise canon.
Their projectiles are driven by laser with a meeting security of only a few meters towards the target.
The 25 mm caliber special shots designed for this gun and contain high-explosive explosives work practically like small granates.
The shots can be programmed so that they can explode not only when they blow the target, but at any point of their ballistic plane.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who hides behind a barrier - a wall or in the fireplace.
For from above he is usually not protected, so the murderous steel plunger rain from above can easily put him out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new fighter weapon is the first infantry weapon to make use of "smart" technologies.
"The soldier is basically as follows: he visualizes the target and sends out a laser radius that determines the distance, so he gains a precise vision point after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to print.
"Let's say you've got 543 feet."
“When you push, the gun rises up and shoots at the distance 543 metres plus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu Group transfers its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will place their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu transfers its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the industry industry specialized in computers and maintenance on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be placed their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Street in Frankfurt City District Niederrad.
A spokeswoman of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, there should be more than 100 jobs in the group, which have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large space offices in the Astro Park would better meet the work of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only a renter.
The responsible CEO Bernd Wagner said, “with Frankfurt Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region highlighted the joy of the winners and the disappointment of the losers.
The Frankfurter Economist Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was once again won a Global Player.
This is a "great location recognition".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for the lower wheel.
Bad Homburg's Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“We have, of course, provided our assistance to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could have changed nothing about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the renter of the real estate at Marienbader.
Finally, economic reasons would have caused the outbreak.
Now it’s about preventing long learning in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and hire of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Line Verticals" with the rest of the buildings at Marienbader Square ten years ago were among the most controversial building projects in Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between railway station and Rathaus, which provided criticism for both the massive construction of the areas used in part as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu associated with Siemens at the time.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter German Real Estate Chancen Group along with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and re-salesed a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu counterpart is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees are in Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, which is intended to be other subsidiaries in this location to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, the office building Astro Park was rented 7000 square meters.
In the 20-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped foundations - the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Industry has its headquarters.
Amazon blocks servers - threats to Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly under pressure.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
This may be behind political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depths.
Wikileaks founder Assange is claimed to stop in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is increasingly driven by taxes in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American servers and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s branch list, is expected to stay in the UK according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks out of Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the country of the outdoors," the disclosure activists reported through the Twitter short-setting service on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to address the high numbers of access to documents when they published secret diplomatic depesses.
Wikileaks said on Twitter: “Prima – our dollars are now spent on hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “you should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's employees have hired research, CNN said in a call to the office of Liebermans.
The president of the Senate Committee for Homeland Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British guard said.
"I would have wanted Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," the Senator said.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to refuse the use of servers in other countries as well.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, unprecedented and unrecognized action puts our national security on the stake and threatens the lives around the globe," the Senate said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen materials.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for rape suspected by the authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol’s branch list.
According to a report from the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian in the UK is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred the investigations to its opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
“There were even rumors after a murder by Julian Assange.”
Assange was rightly afraid of his safety,” said Hrafnsson.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had requested that the responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be charged and convicted of betrayals.
In Canada, an adviser of government chief Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television, Assange should be "killing" and Obama could "use a drone."
As a result, between the White House and Assange was a sharp exchange.
The spokesman of U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laughterly and absurd" that Assange had requested the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently announced spying demands to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we take care of a guy’s opinion on a website,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more significant than its website."
The U.S. government now puts the protection of its databases in full on the test level.
As a Special Representative, the Deputy Director of the Center for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after the release of the messages by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and the most active ones, they should be in danger by the release of WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything to contact them," said Philip Crowley, Foreign Officer.
“We are ready to protect them if that should be necessary.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice controllers will be prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest approach and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelation and from the gelation.
The glacier, in German somewhat old-fashioned ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice taste.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the refrigerator with a patch, pulls it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don’t have to go to Anzola dell’Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice doesn’t come to the Gelato University of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University founded the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to meet the high Italian ideals of ice cream from its machines everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest approach and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice and practices in the home ice parts.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just get rid of their vague desire for ice.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an artist from California, loves the Slow Food Movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business advisor and wants to do something special in a nervous-free job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice sheet in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian householder Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the participants first the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Determining is not only good taste, but also the sickness and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the scenery of the national and even Southern overseas: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romantic."
The first step towards manufacturing seems very simple.
Luciano pumps the basic ingredients of milk, seed, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools up to four degrees immediately.
Then he turns on the machine a hint, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all dairy varieties.
Immediately, the teacher is arguing with questions: Can you produce ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How to freeze your own experimental desire?
Luciano warns that the spirit of time leads to error.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as garbage nucleus from the garbage.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then you need to sell it within a day, otherwise you can put it together, and the customer is shaking on a loud scalp.
Conscious variations in the base mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn dozens of aromatized additives to you."
“But you should just experiment.”
Whether in the fruits orbetes with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow with eggs and with cocoa powder based on all possible chocolate dishes.
Now the participants are allowed to join the ice machinery.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is subjected to the fruit species.
More aromas, more fruit pure - tastefully this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste nourishing if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture raises the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice production is a computing task: If Pfirsich pure is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For lemonneis, an extraction of sugar is required.
Luciano draws out a device to determine the sugar content of the fruit species (winner thus measuring the eggs in the vineyard).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to calculate.
Ice cream does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device to automate the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is creamly beaten at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
All automation, however, remains small.
The Brazilian Gustavo climbs and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit pyree when the superdimensional stab mixer is out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it is just a matter of time until something like that happens.”
Controllers in two lights
The European Food Authority Efsa is underway by the experimenting industry with gene plants.
This claim is now formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is understood as an independent Institute for Impact Assessment of Biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years at the Ilsi Lobbyist Association.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has co-operated with the Efsa testing regulations for gene plants, and is therefore in a clear conflict of interests, then criticized.
The Efsa regulations are literally equal to position papers of the Ilsi and thus deceive the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has committed a collision of interest.
Thus, a high-level Efsa manager is recently without any charges or transition time to the Swiss farming group Syngenta - and has thus changed the pages.
The Central German Broadcasting Radio (MDR) has also recently revealed personal connections between controllers of the EU and industrial lobby, which has made the Environmental Federation, as well as parliamentarians of the EU, bright.
However, the EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
It is based on all confidential data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, according to a statement.
Experts working for Efsa do not require that they have no contact with the industry.
But they have to disclose this.
Kuiper puts his work on the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This itself is called a neutral forum for experts in science, industry and politics - among other things for the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding attempts and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know, for example, what makes genetically modified corn on the ground,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them then?" he asked.
This is how Angelika Hilbeck looks.
The scientist has been researching in genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, such as in the United States now in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly researchers who have not fled with companies.
Critical studies would usually not be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck claimed.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell also took care of the one, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night, he stood in the form of Stuttgart Railway Station, the Tuba on the back.
It was a demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: in September the baggers were attacked and began breaking a large piece of the north wings.
The Stuttgart World was no longer the same: Thirty-two thousand demonstrated against S21, the billion-heavy deepening of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large portion of the wing was in thumbs.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft tower stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is picturehauer in Eastfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the brokes.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
He swears, "A cheaper and poorer stone, simple and earthly."
When he stopped, he smoked cigarettes.
What he's going to do with the brokers, he still doesn't know.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest at Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone-reign.
The 44-year-old trades with old stones.
He bought all those that were fitted at the Abriss in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be made to scotch or disappear in the deponia," he said in his office, a wooden bush that once was a washing house.
He was shit and threatened, he told the newspapers that he had purchased the remains of the northern wing by the abbreviator.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he warned them not to be able to do anything for him.
And if it happens once, then it is the most reasonable if the stones were to be used.
Around 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the average 80 kg heavy squares, price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of being able to return it to a rebuild.
500 tons had bought ropes, 25 large truck charges.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, housebauer.
They came from everywhere and had removed what they could carry a luggage and adhesives.
The Stuttgart stones of the stroke have long been transformed into "muerle" or restricted by herb beds.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” Rongen says.
"Don't be the political component."
He ascends into his car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of kingdom.
Jura studied and dismissed biology later, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone merchants.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tonnes of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he carries his treasures together.
He says he is the largest old stone merchant in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow are artificially claimed sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marien Bridge," he said.
Elbsandstone, yellow, warm, he swears.
"My favorite stone."
It goes the way up through the forest.
It shows on a crowd: red sandstone, an early part of the Karlsruher train station.
And further.
"Beautiful Travertin."
The Quader once belonged to the Tribüne of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidency, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What kind of work, what kind of effort, what kind of welding.
If Rongen thinks of how the stones were scratched by hand before and moved with simple bottle trains and ox carries, he will be very frightening.
"It would be a scandal if you'd be fooling something like that."
He has not become rich, nor is he rich in stone.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchants today, as well as have settled up in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a screw, a glass cake and a gardener.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” said the rest valuer.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent fight for high potentials
There is a rainfall on the buffet.
16 Students are embracing lacafroe, tomato soup and sweets.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen Autobuilder invited mechanical and design students to a workshop.
In some kind of ideal competition, they, along with VW developers, will be able to meet about the car of the future – and in addition to Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest heads, today many companies are engaged in the competition and, like VW, are putting on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in hearing aids before they come to the labour market and are turned around by others.
And since the universities do not publish exhibitions on the performance of their students, you try to expand and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is working around the talent.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball writers, rubber berries and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of practice programs and student jobs and shows them paths in the groups.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig supports the project with VW.
He sees the benefits of both sides: "The students come in contact with industry and collect experiences."
"VW can at the same time meet students, look closer to interesting candidates and think about who comes into question as employees."
Such cooperations, such as Selle, are not unusual.
It is so offensive to the students.
"Last time the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the new graduates will probably become even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
However, they need to praise themselves and particularly pay attention to highly qualified workers.
Absolvents from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineering disaster will become even greater, according to VDI forecasts.
For KPMG’s accounting and consulting company, Roman Dykta goes to the talent jagd.
He organizes recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a modern cutting track where participants need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students will send the company all over the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can view KPMG branches and meet the company.
Anyone who is allowed will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crême de la Crême of the many candidates flys to the United States.
When heating and stealing around the high potential at universities, the shields are increasingly larger, according to Dykta.
“We want to get rid of the race.”
“A simple sailing disturbance was too little to us.”
For talent hunters, the bill appears to be cancelled.
“To date we have contacted all participants of a similar action last year.”
“Some are just before their completion and want to apply with us soon,” he said.
In addition to the direct bubble on the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classic at professional fairs on the Pirsch.
"We try to reach graduates at professional stages."
"Etwa at the Intersolar," Sitha Stübe, staff manager at solar engineering manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs approximately 1500 employees in Germany.
Sleeve knows about the succession problem.
Currently 35 jobs are written on the company website.
"It is very difficult to occupy vacation positions."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
“The professors give evidence that you can practice with us or write his diploma work.”
Costless advertising is not noticed by solar specialists.
To do this, the company tries to advertise with other advantages for itself: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“This can’t be offered by a large group often,” says Staff Manager Stube.
Money is no longer the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good rising opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld was the 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute establishes an annual list of German employers.
To do this, it examines employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework for employees.
Staff Manager Stübe also expects the placement of additional points with the job seekers.
“I think candidates are looking particularly after external reviews on a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to increase authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer leads over your own employees,” he says.
In the industry, the internal employer branding, that is, employer branding training within its own employment.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employers by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with bands,” Warler says.
Obama Stops New Oil Boiling
There will be no new oil drillings in the coming years before the coast of the U.S. state Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A corresponding ban has adopted the government in Washington - and thus revoked its previous plans definitively.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new boring remains prohibited.
This was reported by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The strict ban that will apply for at least the next five years is the explosion of the bore platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drillings in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters want to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever bears the responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf has not been finally clarified until now.
At the center of criticism, the British energy group BP is facing billions of demands.
An investigation commission on behalf of Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had cancelled the bow stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies had immediately filed applications for new promotional projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which had been arrested after numerous corruption plans, is fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close lucky tax locks for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before by a rigorous regulation.
“The plans of the government are the biggest brakes for the growth of the oil and gas industry,” the result of a current industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - still before the promotion offer on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about uncertainty in the industry: “Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be raised up to further - to save growth.
Ogoniland is fired
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gasoline: billions of liters of raw oil flowing has destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by thieves, corruption, and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
“Don’t disturb yourself,” the eco-activator said the journalists, “you will still get enough oil slam before the lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to clear up to the breast of the boys with the shells around him: In the rainbow-colored water glass, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that under the surface of brown crude oil swabs are swabs.
Earlier, she seemed to have collected garnets here, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flowing waters are perfectly dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of raw oil came out of a bustled pipeline into the huge moisture area.
Fishers from the nearby town of Bodo now have to run six hours to reach fishing waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst devastated regions in the world.
The entire extent of destruction is visible on the ride through the mangroven sweeps through river runs.
Rather than light water, the motorboat wraps brown breasts, who throws his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangroven trees rage like black lacry rods out of the ground, sadly allowing palms to unite their wings.
Bird heat, as they are otherwise common in moisture areas, is forgotten: As soon as the outer border silent, it spreads into the former breathtaking quiet, which smells like a gas station.
“What happens here is ecological warfare,” Celestine Akpobari windowster says, “we live in constant danger for health.”
The war comparison is correct.
The settlement area of Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fighting for decades: here are the first explorers from Europe in the past 60 years, here organized in the 1980s with the latter executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to set up its production because it became dangerous for its oil workers in 1993.
Still today the company is forbidden to return to Ogoniland: while from the entire delta region of Switzerland, the three-fold size of Switzerland is pumped with more than 5,000 bore sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines per day, more than two million facades of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable to the company.
All a few hundred meters stretched stained sets such as strange sculptures from the water: "Christmas tree" are called the heads of the bowl holes too narrowly.
They are up to 50 years old, mostly corrosive to the mark.
Once again, such a borehead breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of raw oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have flown into the Deltas ecosystem in 50 years: year-on-year the amount of oil, as they have dropped into the sea 21 years ago in front of Alaska - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GUE will be disputed about it.
While the Shell group sabotages and the organized oil thief is responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protections see boreheads and lean pipelines as the main cause.
Shell puts significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner proposed to the 2008 group: "Only the rate of defects to the leads is "at a multiple times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like a abandoned, oil-swapped workshop under the open sky, looks out of the mangroven shapes: they are split-swapped and up to the neck oil-swapped.
Under one of the many feathers that are partly connected to pipes, partly randomly distributed on the ground, a fire flatters: an illegal small refinery.
The raw oil is warmed over the fire for several hours, Michael, the head of the group, explains.
First, gasoline passes through the pipes into the cap, then drops at the end of the pipeline and finally diesel.
This is how Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter Diesel for each day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low-per-liter diesel price of nearly 40 euros can still be banned by illegal cookers: because they get their raw materials for free.
It is derived from "bunkerers" who anzap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: This way, according to experts throughout Nigerdelta, the country is lost at least 16 million liters of raw oil daily.
However, only a small portion of the temporary intermediate raw material is illegally processed: the lion’s share fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tankers and displaces it on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is due to the movement of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari deems purely academic.
“If oil societies were not perceived as invaders and would not have destroyed the fishermen’s life base so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage, thieves, and illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, the ratio of the Ogoni is so ruined, especially with Shell, that only a withdrawal of the group would come into question: "Yes, other nationalities such as the Chinese may be better off."
Michael gets nervous.
"The highest time you're going to disappear," said the muscle oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil retailers are captured by the Special Unit of the Armed Forces, they are not threatening to be arrested, but probably a painful swallowing money.
Also, the soldiers mainly from the North of the country want to benefit from the raw material - as are all Nigerians.
“This damn good has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 trimmers
The A380 seems to have a big security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error in the investigation of a notified machine that could lead to a "catastrophel drive failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to accuse the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the noted Qantas Airbus in early November were apparently much more lucky than before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major security problem in the drives of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the event of an oil clay connection, it could generate tiredness and leaks, it said in an opinion published by the ATSB Authority on Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic drive failure".
Rolls-Royce’s drive drives are produced in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now launched legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint in an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
At the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the carrier surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 drives are now needed to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced further safety tests at the Super Jumbo equipped with the affected drives.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security problem has been considered important enough to inform all affected persons.
After the Qantas landing, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines dropped about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa replaced the drive with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Land-wide snowfall eliminates traffic chaos
Germany is in white: overnight snow has fallen nearly all over the country.
On many roads, chaos, trains and flights fall.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter frozen Germany: At ice temperatures, almost the whole republic has climbed on Thursday night - which manyrorts leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east, some 15 centimeters are thick.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is very limited.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in ongoing use, but it wasn’t finished with the constantly rebuilt snow.
In addition, severe evils dropped over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) expects at the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein from morning to storm floods with 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, snowfalls on highways and federal roads led to major problems.
According to the non-weather-centric Meteomedia, alarm level violet was noted in Saxony Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Partly, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, fresh and strong winds provided relief.
There stayed at night several trucks and cars.
Police authorities also reported serious disturbances in the streets in Sachsen-Anhalt.
On the A2 snow and wind led to steam and traffic.
In Thüringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thüringen and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the lines, rotated trees on the rail or ruined upper lines and wheat are the main problems.
In Sachsen, transportation from Leipzig to Nürnberg had to be suspended.
In the Thüring Salon field, an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firefighters and rescue aids with wolves, food and drinks in the train.
The snowmen climbed over the streets.
At large German airports, snowfalls lead to numerous flight losses.
A number of cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a spokesman of the Central Air Force.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have been deleted, according to a fraport spokesman.
Winter service is in ongoing use.
Although there are only a few beached passengers at the airport, they still have nearly 400 field beds for hours.
On many roads, accidents occurred on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a raid with a train on a train in Ostholstein.
The local driver was easily injured.
Near Nürnberg, there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: here also a truck was captured on a railroad because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
On the train, four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nürnberg was therefore closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had climbed on a smooth road with her car at Aschaffenburg.
A good news, however, has the weatherologists: although the snow will still be locker and powdery, and therefore it is already infused with lightweight evils.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is surrounded by rapid and stormful winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its mark: According to a newspaper report, the moneyhouse seeks buyers for the two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros the real estate could be invested.
The German Bank has just made its company beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt Banking Quarter have been modernized, while the bankers were able to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to regain the cost of renovation - and seek a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" calls for a spokesman.
The speaker did not call the reasons for the planned sale.
“We’re always checking whether it’s more meaningful to own or sell real estate itself and then rent it back,” he said.
Thus, Germany’s largest credit institution will resign its company’s headquarters in a short time.
The Bank had only received the double towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from investors of a home fund and then refined it.
The energy conversion was estimated at about 200 million euros.
A sale would have brought the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" according to the newspaper to about 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a bank owned fund or to an independent investor, it is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people are sad about their friends.
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the displaced miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies were still unable to be secured, because the security situation in the disaster shade is still precarie.
Nearly two weeks ago, a huge explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 mountain workers aged between 17 and 62 were displaced under days.
A son was dropped down in the crash, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, for safety reasons, rescue forces were not able to drop down.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts believed that there was no more chance of survival for the companion.
The bodies could not be secured so far.
Now relatives and friends are reminded of the dead with a memorial celebration.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered at sunlight in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
29 tables were placed in honor of the disguised mountaineers, on which helmets, lamps, and the names of the companion were seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfbreeters, also found their place here.
Before the government buildings of the country, the flags were semi-mass.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners “from the depths of the earth” would come back to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the Memorial celebration.
"But they never came home."
He cannot end with the death of his son as long as he has not seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was scattered into the cave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' relatives, several foreign diplomats attended the Memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also displaced.
Rescue workers began to delete a fire inside the coalberg plant on the Southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gas is exhausted, it will begin to cool down the bright temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Is Splatter fit to the art film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn regains with his fighter-episode "Walhalla Rising" old genre borders.
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) gets rid of his opponents and, with almost overhuman strengths, turns around his opponents - it sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero loves to kill the rabbit when he slaughtered his enemy.
On the other hand, Oneuge, as he is actually referred to, says the whole film about no word, and also the other figures can be crushed at least one or two sentences or a couple of challenging cries of death.
Otherwise, it is stirred up and flooded in the scaryly beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Wikinger world offers the cults about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinemas with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
Beautiful if a film has several target groups, it only hurts if they exclude each other.
Winding Refn has been regarded as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" but refuses to make his works more humorous to the mainstream or less brutality available to the arthouse.
Most artistic cinema-friends are likely to be distracted from the spreading brain mass and the memories.
The action fans die at least before long ago, when one of them, for freely interpretable reasons, breaks up to Jerusalem with a crew of violent Christian missionaries via ship and fixes an eternity in floods and nebula before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to quiet there.
It is not surprising that "Walhalla Rising" has found no cinema rental in Germany and is now only released on DVD.
This is especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade, a sometimes exciting movie that deserves some attention.
This movie is not about dialogue or strict action, it is all the atmosphere, a filmed fever dream.
And there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and snacks him with his ice pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack slowly to the throat, but especially with the invisible hatred that hits him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blonde boy, who stands faithfully on the side, keeps himself as innocent, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of the unique hero, whose motives are never declared, but who once becomes a warrior from hell, possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself for enemies and temporary allies.
It means ruin, but maybe only for those who are ruined.
"Walhalla Rising" is a stunning film that you can hate and admire, to anxiety, excitement and surprise.
A experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country turns to take position - it still allows controls.
By midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes are invading a mysterious, dirty building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 km away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley that leaves the electricity.
According to a letter from the U.S. Foreign Secret Service CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were constructed.
For other purposes, however, the technology is hardly out of the fifty years.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with uncharted satellite images.
By computer animation, she melted where the components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was standing shortly before the launch, it was called, but was not yet covered with fire stains.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it is hardly more known than at that time, because the mysteries have become more bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memory that although the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, it was hardly pointed out that there was a "active nuclear program" in the country.
Some secret officers in Europe prefer to be even more careful and only talk about a "normal reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomacy in the summer responded only to lapidar, which IAEA "has enough material to ask questions."
The shooting of the alleged "unused military buildings" although the Syrians were jealous and planned the area thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team among former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which was produced by humans.
In addition, IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from the time after the attack, which would be more profound than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - has purchased them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always been forced to have never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium is derived from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA showed that after the analysis of the particles it was unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as satellite images.
In addition, the controllers prohibit a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the drums of the broken-bombered building.
Israel is still iron.
"We will never comment on this," the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack confirmed recently.
As a result, the investigation of the case has failed since June 2008 and "is becoming increasingly a serious issue of credibility for the Authority", as a high-western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear weapon breakthrough treaty in the area where the IAEA is waiting for.
The IAEA seems to be the key to progress in clarification, and it seems to be the key to three other facilities to be "functionally connected" with the likely reactor - and unlike this one still exists.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities it is, what function they have or what they may appear suspicious.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IAEA, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these sites and found a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, where it is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - with this reason, IAEA denies access to the three places.
In Vienna, Syrians were afraid of a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent from the United States to evacuate military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had been focused on the facilities by a tip of U.S. secret services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photographs, that material was transported to and re-transported between the three locations and the quader on the Euphrates.
A high-western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there is no "indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or recycling; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
However, where the uranium should come and where the plutonium should be separated for the bomb later, there are obvious assumptions on these central issues.
It is also unclear whether the trees that could trace the precious mountains were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one would have any information about where the shot was left.
The only few kilometers of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, Salzmine al-Tibni, which Syria has investigated in 1998 as a radioactive waste camp, is considered unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane’s Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria had previously worked on earthquakes to the three suspected places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be accidental, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
It is also said in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets – only the effort shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna have complained that the reactor has been destroyed a year ago, the matter has no high urgency, then US ambassador Glyn Davies has brought in the game so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the hardest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “a choice I am open to in the future,” but he still argues.
There is a high risk in this way: one, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than in an escalation.
On the other hand, what a diplomat gives to think: "What if they finally find nothing?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie has started working on her unnominated regidebüt in the summer, there are troubles.
The script itself wrote a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it, but it’s enough for anxiety.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, fell in love during the Yugoslav War in her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, after which some of the scheduled tour days in Sarajevo were moved short-termly to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is turned out in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of women’s war sacrifices wrote about UNHCR’s refugee aid work to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie himself is the ambassador of the UN refugee aid work.
She isn't diplomatic - she has already offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There haven’t been love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims betrayed them enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee aid, its organization has recommended that Jolie be released as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has been able to read her script, has granted a turn permission to Sarajevo after some Hin and Her - it is not quite clear why Jolie then did not come yet.
The younger author itself, she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the conflict with Yugoslavia, to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a vote to all parties involved.
With content, however, it remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis goes to the film on the network, which then sounds quite different: the lovers met in it before the war eruption and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is climbed into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What yes, however, sounds significantly different from the variant "Victims of rape fall into torture".
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now it is possible that only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by putting the script, as many earlier, into the network illegally.
Nothing like going out here
This evening, it will finally run well for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
To do this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
Fans joke before joy when they crash loud music, they stamped with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the Southern Cork boasts because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups.
"Beerpong" is called the strange speculation, to win there are €500 win prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this screaming beverage game and the remaining computer that doesn't really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun in distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a game fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct candidate talks in New Zealand in January.
“I have a mulm feeling,” he said.
“It’s so far from home and I don’t have any work there yet.”
After all: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, sucked her wish as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," the young man says and smiles.
Due to bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already searched for their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now has a job as an IT advisor in London.
The boys go: Like the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will soon leave the country, experts from the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Research in Dublin said.
By 2015, they estimate 200,000 migrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, there is a huge loss.
As the forecasts are confirmed, there is a wave of immigration similar to that of those under Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now again spreading.
The economic crisis disturbs especially the young, well-trained Irish, for whom it has only gone up to date.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the Boom Years.
Everyone was needed, money was in excess.
But now there are three of the ten women and under thirty men without work.
The Irish Times reports on readers of young migrants complaining: "Everything goes down the bach in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can, leaves and our country loses a whole generation.”
“The latter then makes the light.”
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, is seeing a dark future, because the government only operates eye-wiseness and no longer offers young people future prospects.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old said.
She watches how their commilitants hang from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest worries, she says, is to have to migrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressed."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to positively occupy the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a round service to work abroad.
“For professional beginners, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career manager,” the manager says.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for a half a year.
Because there was nothing to do with the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they’re just upstairs a fashion house.
In January it will continue to Hannover or Berlin, the next project.
His home is still rarely seen by O'Donovan, because he makes extra layers to pay the loan for his home.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says when he passes over the threshold of his house after a long time for the first time.
“I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as never again.”
He laughs a little and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with careful facilities, in the entrance parks large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for €380,000 four years ago - 100% credit funded.
“There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions,” he said.
Is he afraid that it could be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks about a while, drinks hot tea and says, "I don't have children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The engineer doesn’t like the complaint he hears at the moment.
"No one has to hunger - our situation is not as dramatic as before here on the island," he said.
“For a while working abroad is not the worst thing that can happen – maybe we just feel like an Irish.”
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“After seven years, he was back there and life continued in Ireland, quite simple.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how it runs with life elsewhere.
For a few years he has worked in London, and why shouldn’t he work well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
But there is still one thing that concerns him very much these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it might fall into a livestock party.
"Blood not too many emotions," he says, and drinks a big bowl of his beer.
"Life, that sounds scary."
"Let's prefer to call it a retired party, very lucky, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The democratic routine
The movement of democracy in Latin America becomes stronger, like the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than the United States.
The Latinobarómetro survey was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts fall apart in this year's survey from September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by approximately 6% annually since 2002, the number of Democratic supporters has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong invasion last year, this trend is to be recognized.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which are as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin American economic crisis undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This also persisted during the global economic crisis, perhaps because Latin America has only experienced a short recession phase and has quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America increased slightly and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see Diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of the divorced president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflect a widespread reflection of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more noticeable and has increased violence, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the survey began, many surveys in Latin America in crimes in their country see a greater problem than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say they have either been victims of a crime last year or a family member, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic performance reflects the stronger support of the private and market economy: approximately 71% of the surveyed overregionally indicated that the private economy is indispensable for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6).
About 58% said that only market economy could make progress to its country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although her left president, Hugo Chávez, represents many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the contrary, the polls in Mexico and most Central America countries see the most influential country in the United States, taking this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua by Venezuela.
A Election Sleeve
No one had expected the elections in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But the facts surpassed the fears of the elected helpers who were eager to help the occupied country.
Overfilled elections, repeated votes, votes in the Rinnstein, ruined election rooms and threats were just part of the problems.
Elections open with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom became homeless by the earthquake in January, stripped around looking for an option.
Some finally resigned.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some likely top leaders, demanded the cancellation of election results due to a alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election "as quite good in many matters".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community, “if these irregularities are so serious they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is claimed to be committed to the unpopular divorced President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected key selection will be completed in January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, Rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no consent in the voters, declares the voters the winner of the key election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million victims of earthquake still live in tents, a small election participation was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organization to vote.
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 certificates needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Homemade in the middle
In the weeks after your husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy, driving her popularity rate by over 50% upwards. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, if she helps this next year to reelection, it depends on whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is more compromised than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who also led the economic policy after his wife’s choice, often presented budget plans that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the President’s pair to spend the extra income on their own goods.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further destruction.
Some regime critics from the rows of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (which one parliamentary struck another in the face and others held the government of defence) Congress failed to approve the budget for 2011.
“I’m not going to talk about it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now applies also to the next year, which makes the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own goods.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate, for example, is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and salary requirements of the trade unions - increase the value to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was crushed by economic crises, declared growth and poverty struggle to its main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, smuggled the private sector, and underwent the National Institute of Statistics and People's Accounting INDEC, which then enjoyed the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate way?
She called on the private economy and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, salaries increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high global market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation was under the growth threshold due to a large devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may therefore want to join Argentina financially again to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government met an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt in 2001.
Now, Fernández appears to press an agreement with the money labourers from the Paris Club to which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Churches had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economy, Amado Boudou, announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of his office, even without the support of her husband.
If yes, it needs support from the middle class, which mostly has enough of the Churchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will be removed.
If she wants to win another choice, she must decide whether she quietly and quietly cancels many political decisions of her husband.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan hold of his great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all eligibility to vote in the five councils of mayors and municipal councils, are assessed as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building a breaking business relationship, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Mom did the exam, but only a few.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three out of five mayors, she did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan’s greater independence, received nearly 50% of the votes that the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would mean problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the vote of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT into the city councils.
During the elections, there were common events in Taiwan such as truck convoys with crawl makers, flag-swing mass movements and only spearly dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honorary president of the KMT, held a speech to a KMT candidate in the evening of the election,
And a man came to him in the face of the multitude, and was wounded, and was killed by the eyewitness.
It's unclear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or argue with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, impaired the election and put the DPP into a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
China was probably the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relations with the mainland were not thematicized.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to make its relations with the government in Beijing a priority.
But this time, the DPP also avoids too much to irritate the anti-Chinese feelings.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, on the other hand, wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwaneses support its Chinese policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a dealer to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It is better to wait until the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has been re-invented.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was sitting in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he joined vehemently for absolute independence.
However, under Tai’s governance, a new generation of humiliated politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai found great consent as a presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Their party now does everything to show that it is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans to bring an idea to the point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unpredictable discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that its party offers a "reliable alternative" to much faster approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the DPP candidates would have done better to maintain Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged the Pragmatic Su to resign from the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen’s intervention, the DPP is difficult to choose their possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analyse.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to lead their election fight without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity appear to be unemployment and the increasingly increasing sharpness between arm and empire.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports a re-approach only limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no longer a return.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you arrive at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated surprisingly for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since its 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination appears slightly unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist was known before the album was released, with which he may have released at least three albums in the broad public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is definitely a step forward. And with her appealing voice and a good feeling of pop, radio and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings comes next to you.
In addition, Vijay Iyer Trios's album "Historicity" was nominated in the category instrumental albums.
The competitors include "Moody 4B" of experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a popular favorite from New Orleans and more frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, in which they are more likely to find albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category Great Group, thus attracting the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life image "Pathways" is a good example for a Bassist as a Democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads to classical categories
The nominations for the 53th Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectical orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominated connections to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", this piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and was directed at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A. composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandoline concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, chore to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckners Symphony No. 3 and 4 by Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Chicago's "Dreamhouse" by Boston's Modern Orchestra Project and Cyrus's's "Arteem of the Synergy Vocals";
In the opera category, mountains were "Lulu of the Royal Opera House's Orchestra; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Walker" by the Orchestra and National Orchestra's Arthurvan of Sulhsky and Chor of The Mariinsky.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was recorded and recorded in the Disney Hall on January 4, by the L.A. Philharmonics led by Esa-Pekka Salons.
This 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who sits in jail in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinen Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. announced that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandoline artist Avi Avital, who initiated the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the Orchestra Deal category for the recording of the works of Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, geigerin Julia Fischer and harpfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year, only women were nominated as vocalists, including Anne Sofie by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, sopranist Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often hot public hearing, found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and traffic status.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center meets local regulations and will become aesthetic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
“It shows that justice rules.”
“There are only few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley, there are wonderful people."
The session began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides, according to Press-Enterprise, being fairly uniformly distributed.
The debate was continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one commented.
"It's another planet of the apples, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is over."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His community, with about 135 families, has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wished a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filtering manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style is intended to have two minarets and be about 13m high.
It is intended to be found on the approximately 17,500 m2 large property on the Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbes could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can live amongst Arsen opens new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements that have been considered vital to life.
“This organism has two possibilities.”
"He needs phosphorus or arsenal to grow."
"This makes something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'free' lifestyle," Paul C.W. Davies, from the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, published on Thursday in the online edition of the magazine Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, as scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsen.
"There is a question about what else is possible," Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report said at Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in searching for alien-dischemous life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study addresses microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced about the discovery, caused too widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery shows that in other planet systems organisms can launch biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the ‘standard elements’ that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed,” said Charles Cockell, Professor at Planetary and Space Science Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another,” Cockell added.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose Mono Lake due to its high arsenal content.
Since arsen and phosphorus are chemically the same, they assumed that microbes that are both exposed could possibly replace one element by the other.
“The toxicity of the arsenal is primarily based on the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus.”
This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other.
"But the difference is so great that Arsen works differently than phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system where it almost smashed everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers exhibited the bacterium GFAJ-1 with an increase in arsenal concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbes grow better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenal, it shows that an arsenal-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenal is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsen is not new.
Arsen occurred more frequently in early earthquakes, she says, that is why science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
“There’s a reason to assume that life can also evolve differently than in the early Earth Age,” Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Energy Ministry and the National Health Authority.
The rest of the stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen before a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs – two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis – disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, where the animals were stayed before a Bellflower Motel 6 nights.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, says Steve Whitmore, a spokesman from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
“The good news is: the dogs are good,” Whitmore said.
"You are in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not provide accurate information about the location of the dogs yet about the circumstances that have led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a county animal house in Downey in reception.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old kidney, and Didi, a 10-month-old kidney - were uninjured, according to the official statement.
But Corgis Bunny and Peter, which Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, living in Redding, were in the city this weekend due to the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the couple from dog view to dog view.
On Monday night Peek and Rickard checked in at the Motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their car in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer bag, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis remained in the furniture because it was cooler there.
They left the window open a column wide so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 p.m.
Peek promised to anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis to find a salary. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it wasn’t clear whether a finding salary was paid.
The lion resigns after judicial approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
A New Yorker competitor officially blessed the "prepared" credit plan on Thursday to lose $5 billion in debt and take the way to the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. competition law, so the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer be on the way. Barber and Birnbaum will face the slightly dismissed studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
Chapter 11 will come into force for MGM only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned liability of $500 million to finance new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which owns $75 million, runs the company. The funding is expected to be until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order of the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company’s management, who fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his operation at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial care and pay more than 140 studio drivers lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company to buy at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted only few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began before the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially overcome the competition over the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co. that has already received $1.2 million is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, receives a $4 million success bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to re-enroll production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and made a year plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinema in early 2012.
They also plan two films for "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate liability between $265 million to $275 million for its financial share in these two films to be generated under Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who funded about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he was.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget balanced
This year’s favourite gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can break a significant hole into your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic spring seats or about 48 doses Play Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy traders - a Wal-Mart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that the law of Moores has entered into force this year. The technology toys are more powerful and costs at the same time a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, one of the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, is a broader offer.
There are more and more button-cell-driven toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise indicated, all prices for Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children aged 3 years) are plumbing figures, as large as marine pigs singing a note when pressing on their stomach.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, you can play a song by multiple pressing.
Several singing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Note: If you have started pressing once, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animated puppy offers interplays such as 'Simon says', and thanks to its new sharp feet with bike blocking, it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will definitely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back there (Hasbro/Playsschool, $40, for children from 3), with a full number of questionnaire cards that allow a car trip to a lesson, with a better auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained on it are not as curious as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12), which after Leapfrogs is the first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, bright screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and ebooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Lastly, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not bigger than a wooden box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about gathering the blocks together in words before the time is over. It is great for an improvised book stairs competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N match figure package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Club Penguin Store.
This can be roll shoes or a puffle boot.
The latest head cell-driven microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The copper moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone bones in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an error garden from keys.
And he holds up a little.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even overcame some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police interventions in China become more mild
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked through a city square, checked his nervous subjects and issued commands with military authority and distorted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and ignored for their arbitrary races and hanging to violence - to impress the spectators.
"It's right standing!"
"Blick right!"
"Let's show them," he exclaimed, "how beautiful girls are like this."
Four girls, hardly grown to the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood strictly.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four ordinary cottages were perfectly on the blue-white-sleeved hair.
"For me, they look on average," Mr. Tang notes low-value.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polarize the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a college degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan replaced violence by low stars in Central China: According to reports in 2009, 50 officials circled a well-equipped imbiss truck and urged the operator until it took off and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have reinforced the city police strips and have been selected specially due to their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are supposed to give the brutal police a more soft, female aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would also hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese had from these city commands.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may carry out urban laws only using fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely show a different image.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei struck a spectator to death when the spectator filmed them with his phone as they struck a protest against a waste hall.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, which describes how criminals can be defeated without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai water melon dealer suffered from a handheld with five brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street merchants.
"Chengguan makes the government scary," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleaning".
Sceptics are the current approach for significantly insufficient.
When the district sought eight women’s recruits in October by an announcement, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or should serve as an optical deviation.
Probably both.
Women aged 18 to 22 were searched for good figures and "harmonic face dresses".
They should be overweight - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inch.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the age of 26.
According to officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically stressful.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district official at the near government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job, it depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, face, etc."
Then come temperament and "intrinsic qualities".
“Female chengguan are like flowers,” he said, and added, “but they still have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to comply with this description,
However, it was not unusual in China that the sizes in post-admissions for both gender are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform face trees.
Whether it is similar to good appearance, it is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities don’t have to apply.
"We can't use lakes or buckles here," Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, patrolling on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22 years old, has apple beans and a well-formed mouth.
She didn’t feel like sexist, so much value was put on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her colleague, Xu Yang, who is 21 years old, comments, "We have the task to represent the city's image."
They don’t regret the short attitude because they had more ambitious career plans than just to scare traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the stripes deal with about twelve street merchants who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are hunted.
"Mr. Wang, please leave here."
"We have told you so often," explains Frl. Xu to a trader who had fled on foot and temporarily left his nude kitchen attached to a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotony than an effort.
"It's almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studys free time sales.
"All Routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals by reporting them to their male boss.
This is intended to protect from public allegations to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, randomly reported after the rumors were curious, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night accident, 14 government vehicles were thrown or fired.
Xindu has remained deprived of such violence.
However, disturbances are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang square, where the female officials patroled this morning, more than 50 people met on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired in a workshop instead of contrary to the rules on the civic ride.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute complaint, the officials with a greedy face broke the way to their vehicles and continued driving the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old, a male strip coordinator, remained behind, turning his white name shield to remain anonymous.
As their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
However, they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
“Sometimes, too, physically,” Mr. Li explains.
“Most of the time people start fighting.”
Attorney will not accuse Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign, have released the charges which were raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to provide a lobbying activity to her husband, Senator’s attorneys reported on Wednesday.
This decision ends the hardest legislative proposal against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, until the scandal that led to strike titles across the country and detained his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate for the Republican for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's Office announced, he was "happily pleased with the judgment after the one-year investigation."
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s attorneys, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were suspended and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express itself in the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, and you think there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in the New York Times for the first time in October 2009 made the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral aids, would make to-morrow orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was acting as a treasurer during an Ensigns campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton work. According to the documents and interviews, he took over for them after Hampton’s lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently still in the Ensigns election team, he hadn't been able to take lobby work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethical experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which had been closely friendly before the affair, was contrary to the so-called ban of rotary lobbying.
According to the published indicators, “it seems to be a negotiation and a violation of the rule of thumbnails,” says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of customers who are in the government’s vision.
While the Ministry of Justice had officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical authorities said that the Ministry seemed very careful in taking political charges after a variety of defeats pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to have the State's accusation against the previous Senator's accusation against Feyts Steven.
State attorneys “are obviously terrifying,” Melanie Sloan, president of the Association of “Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington” (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in parliamentary and governmental circles of the United States), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr Ensign in court.
"This is essentially that senior government officials can now assume that the laws are not applicable to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Ensign, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another on the next day that he was informed that the ministry would not file complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign’s defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as the Senator repeated in a statement on Wednesday, he “warned with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments he had submitted to the prosecutors in more detail.
"I'm not going to go to the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me, but just as many say: we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to suspend investigations for a separate ethical complaint by the group, after a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents infringed the Hamptons against the Federal Election Act.
The election commission said there wasn’t enough evidence that the money had been something different than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies Mr. Hampton found with the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 demonstrates that after the company passed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's staff chief, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "crashing" at the Interior Ministry for a matter.
Mr. Ensign also went to lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had suspended lobbying work.
Last year, when information about this affair was first brought to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave his position in the Senate, where he had been in the fourth position of the Republicans.
After he had not noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the aim of police investigations, his press spokesman Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, said that the ethical committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls on Twitter
Half a dozen of them dropped into the crawls in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports on grey witnesses on Twitter.
At the end of the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape process and children chained to beds in a house that occurred in flames.
The attentively prosecuted trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the trial on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed applications to court, which will provide reasons for the appeal and which will be occupied by the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that through the intensive reporting of the process - including through the extensive use of Twitter through average reporters - it has come to a "circuit atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of excitement details, so that the jury has become inadmissible by public disarmament.
This objection could encourage the appeal courts to deal with the question of whether new technologies will be made necessary for new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I think it's really a danger if the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Chief Defence Mr. Hayes.
Jon C. Blue, chairman of the Supreme Court, dismissed last week the petitions by decision shortly and blamelessly when he said the new media would be "carefully controlled" and there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that certainly wasn’t the last word in this matter yet.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on famous-famous cases causes doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who had killed his wife, and said in his decision that due to the new media there had been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some believe that the television series and the film "On the escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court claims that Mr. Hayes’ sentence had been considered a half-century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the way of communication from the court court which was still unintentional at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the new media in processes pursued by a wide public," John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, said.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the proceedings more fair.
The Twitter affair is only one of many that Mr. Hayes’ attorneys present to discuss over years and thus delay a sentence.
For example, the defenders also argued that Mr. Hayes could have already been convicted as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them grey case photographs during the jury election.
Some of the jury said photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her upbringers, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have fulfilled them with abuse.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge had wrongly exchanged a lawyer who had been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had unacceptablely put pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to free the jury over the weeks.
The jury was not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest in themselves.
In a sentence allegation they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the Governor’s office and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the new media would have continuously renewed the flames of emotions over the case.
“A day-to-day aspect of media, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “we have not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even across the country.”
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the assertion that these direct news are more controversial than reports that are being returned slowly is a technically hostile look that reduces the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they refer to the Supreme Court’s judgment of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard’s condemnation was revoked due to reporting and made clear that the new media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can honesty connect the separating?
Following a campaign of sharp words and negativeness, there is little dishonesty in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a true two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and the top of the Congress on Tuesday did not break into the major issues with which you had to deal with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period where no decisions would be made.
After all what you hear, it was not a challenging discussion between two different sides or an attention to their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the President’s deficit committee on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It appears to be clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect, which secrets the ideological cluster that continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has come to an end.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise willingness is required, while oneself is trying to consider the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of voters after a re-war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep as if you could expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, donations, health or warnings, both sides are kilometers away from each other.
Lastly, the November election has voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections create partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly a different choice than to find a solution.
Bush’s tax reduction at the end of the year, and no one supports this.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Likewise, a compromise on increased unemployment disadvantages is to be expected, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich are refused to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and ratify the new START contract at the same time.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session will not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation with the parties when the new 112th Congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things to be done, this short-term psychology will be killed in confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - leading to genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening today to 2012 as a pre-combat, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the emergence of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party exchangers who served their education.
How worried the Republican leaders may be that they are too high poker, they know they have to try to keep their promises to reduce government expenditure and put out the health reform.
These partial lines are already clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a reform of taxes and the increase of certain taxes, as well as an increase in pension age and a reduction in public expenditure.
Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the hardest jobs in Washington and have, according to their own estimate, so much pressured to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation, and they struggle very hard to get closer to this number.
The biggest resistance occurs in the elected representatives of the Board, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of partial conflicts, when the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes and health system later followed by a phase of bigger bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a sackgase, as it did in 1995, both parties must carefully pay attention to the public response.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
In fact, this may be an optimistic perspective.
Partiality and polarisation are today bigger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological cluster between Obama and Congress Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 consider a pure precursor for a much wider 2012 election in consequence.
In this way, many Americans can welcome the dishonesty wearing this week to show.
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common nominee in the issues that continue to separate the two from each other.
U.S. secured document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it gives part of the funding funds and the protective funds it collects on the Kremlin, as the US embassy in Russia reported in February in a memory.
Both police and the state security service are pushing high protection funds so they can keep their expensive living standards in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal bands.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority" - takes its part from the money that the heads go upward.
The memo, sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly evidence that he would have been dismissed in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption allegations over years, and he has won numerous allegations against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a documentation suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's fucking, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador’s report, individuals are called, and it is unhearted that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the government of Moscow with crime has led to some calling it a ‘gesterity’ and concluding that the government acts more like a cleptocratic than a government,” the Memo said.
Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of crimes / the mafia, which means "that" or "protection") that extends itself over police, state security (FSB), the supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Professionals have discovered a three-way structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Recently, the ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors are following at the lowest level."
“This is an inkompetent system where criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not provide any help.”
The report continues to say that the FSB cashes money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small business people.
A source, which is called, is “called that Moscow’s business owners understand that it’s best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as questioned as before."
The memory notes that while collecting money is comprehensive, protection itself is not very modest; even those paying are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed before - due to one or another prejudice.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with bags that were probably full of money.
"In his struggle against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
“It’s not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
India estimates that corruption in Russia costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154 in a newer investigation into the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries listed from "lessly corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The disclosure of the American embassy memos, which took place after the last night of Moscow, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angry to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an ethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront the Past
In a weakly illuminated, concrete classroom with dirty and bright walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Due to its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in Northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitalization of the Khmer Rouge against the government, long-term followers in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge for the first time.
In July, a Commonwealth court of the United Nations and Cambodia condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it condemned the former head of the famous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs grew up, making their efforts to reconciliate and reintegrate into Cambodia’s society.
"There is still rejecting and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For her life was glorious under the Khmer Red, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It splits families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, revisions or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government fell in 1979, the remainder of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998 when the last movement capitulated, anxiety.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountains and the jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to the government, leading to the capitalizations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Sampan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not been detained, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he waited for his trial.
When their honors no longer protected them, most former Khmers Redge fighters fled into the ruining poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite officers of the Khmer Rouge maintained their local government posts because they settled their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from the capitalization," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds all over Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng, public forums.
"They are enclosed into the Utopian Agrarideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he founded in 1998 to live as a poor rice builder.
“Living under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
The court will try to present Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The Court’s mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those responsible mainly for the crimes, but it is not said whether further actions will be pursued beyond these four cases.
This has little helped to mild the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64, which had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told representatives of the documentation center in Cambodia that she led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
In a hot evening, I came back from work on the fields to their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Red.
If the court charged them, they would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodscha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there's no persecution anymore, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians were discussing this.
"Cambodscha must bury a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Cohesion with the Khmer times means cohesion of broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that they can understand everything.”
The center created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Red, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, containing less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng only know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family refuses many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They’re disrespectful because they’re not sure how many people are condemned by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are increasingly influenced,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains leads to a straight angle of black rust, covered with a sharp leaf roof, a road that is overwhelmed by screws and dirty with plastic rust.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tirehead after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile seller on the street, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burnt here.
And He said to them, “But this kind cannot come out except by prayer and fasting.”
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she's going to put a bush of mature bananas - hoping he'll bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect more armed uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s global nuclear material security campaign, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that we will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had for years tried to convince Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
But officials of the U.S. government told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarus research institution.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the theme, about 500 pounds.
The deal appears to be one of Obama’s most important outcomes of the “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 nations” of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat at the nuclear security summit (from 2012).”
“It proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security group.
Clinton called the deal "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all nuclear material in four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has stated that the nation will never give up their uranium.
"How to maintain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally armed, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will not make dirty bombs from it and we will not sell it to anyone."
“We use it exclusively for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the U.S. a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first step to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly broadcast, officials say.
It has been loaded into a special train that has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and removal, officials say.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government pays for these efforts $14 million, with a large portion of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakened uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and voted to build confidence,” led to the deal signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Ministry working on Global Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Expansive Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of high-enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been stressed for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s harsh disrespect of human rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggests a possible approach.
“The progress of these global security issues is welcome, the United States of America and Belarus announces that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the country’s and its citizens’ progress,” she said.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flight with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across the Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents of Wikileaks and the papers transmitted to the newspaper "El País" (by cable) and added that former deputy government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft will be properly guarded over Spain."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which aid was charged with human rights abuse practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega were discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "have met Zapatero in the desert" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega emphasized that Spain has no objection to secret service flights across the Spanish territory."
“You just want to be informed” to not be “unprepared,” reports Aguirre via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out that the Spanish government "will not pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as they are in the hands of judges."
Attorney Vicente González, in January 2007, gave the embassy to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassifier of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defense Minister on CIA Flights.
"These reports do not contain any chargeful or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was worried about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish State Attorney and the German State Attorney" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are madly thinking of their independence and doing what they consider appropriate," he gave instructions to their employees to "reflect over the burning rhetoric comments."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the procedure of the PP in this matter.
"In spite of their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from a note that the US government of Zapateros actions, which could be interpreted as possible infringements of human rights, will tolerate or deliberately ignore, beat capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he said.
The child killer is accused of complaining on the internet about the “mohsal” of maternity.
The young woman talked about the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the internet "Muki".
Under the name of her childhood, she holds contact with a cousin and at least a girlfriend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know their love life, which the ABC newspaper rebuilds on the basis of witness statements from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman took a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist in 1998.
She held a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, she became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was of him, but his husband never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon afterwards, she entered a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbourhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearics to look at the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship has broken and they separated.
In March 2008, she was alone on Menorca and wrote: “Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work.”
"When I told him, he found it well, but now he understands of course what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to do and to leave what he wants."
Later, she mentioned a message she received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address to which I can send the boy to you."
She complains, “If he doesn’t like to leave the boy with my mother, I’ll take him back when I’m back.”
In May she talks about her return to her village: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only staying there until 19th because I have to imagine a job at 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she brings her firstborn when everything goes well.
“He will be with the one with whom he must be with me, that is, I will never leave him with anyone else except with my mother,” a doubtful intention when one considers their bad relationship.
In July there is another email.
When she writes this, it is believed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly killed on the 10.
"On the one hand Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand, he is with me and he likes the place, but on the other hand, he must go to school every day."
She talks about a move to Mallorca.

Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress for it and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in voting and parliamentary growth in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not - their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes achieved by this party in these elections is usually twice as high as those in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while these figures were only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC and the binding of the PP voters - should stop, the PPP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress deputies in the parliamentary elections, while CiU would also win four (they now have 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - currently it has three - while the ICV could hold or win its Members.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date will fall with the municipal elections in May 2011, and then the People's Party (PP) can be the language on the wage to end the Socialist predominance, in four province capitals and with its majority in 2011 in the Barcelona City Council, one of the 66 million city administrations with the largest household.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists cannot gain a majority or use their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debacle, it is not possible that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Municipal Council, where they have to achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its vote in the four province capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona, where they ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. Mayor Ángel Ros maintains good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party could see a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and seeks to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell took care of thousands of passports in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanians and Nigerians arrested by the Barcelona Police Office formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - 2008 forsenger 106 was the author of the Attentate.
The Spanish Interior Minister gives these investigations a great deal of importance, so as to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" has been "smallified" by the counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaidas worldwide and "as a result of its operational capacity".
The researchers assumed that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were fake and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could without penalty cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only Jihad network that has been active in Europe, so other European police units, besides Thai investigation agencies, have also contributed to the investigation. It is not excluded that there will be similar attacks in the EU in the next few days than those in Barcelona on Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistan's Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested in Thailand, another in which Pakistan's Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshhan Burung countries were detained as well as Sirsan Thai.
They had been led by Bangkok from the cells established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was destroyed in 2009 - in particular, tourists stole passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged between 25 and 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they could not have a visa sign.
In investigations, no connections between the arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay could have been demonstrated so far, although the author of the attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then fake in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent from a cash transfer company, which had been used in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "Commanddo" which prepared the end of the life of 106 people.
Police have taken a comprehensive documentation.
PP demands a resignation of the tax agreement by Mas
President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity to present Artur Mas personally its conditions for supporting his office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which do not differ from those already presented during the elections, the regionalist point of view, the priority of the economic reconciliation, the financial recession and the delay of regional absorption.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party addressed with security Artur Mas, which gave her the 18 deputy who had won last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel imperative, because the candidate is dependent on his vote by the CiU of the bourgeoisie-regional party.
The future alliances that regionalists want to participate in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but the talks that are currently conducted with the other heads of the party are about Catalonia.
As regards the PPC’s party supporters, it calls for "all discussions relating to Catalonia’s sovereignty and independence" and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - similarly in the Basque country - and which the Chief of the Party of CiU wishes to submit to a referendum.
Both political leaders are common that they want to make the built-in political apparatus of regional administration slimer and eliminate the legacy and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the accession of Mas are addressed by PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a harsh opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) - today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Care House confirms that deaths are not due to "missile measures"
The owners of the old house in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed over eleven older people
The senior care officers at La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they found the damage to the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés, the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people during his work.
Joan Sala, the head of the Old Care House, came up with his attorney, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths), but "the right and our liability force us to accept the proceedings and civil liability."
The institution must not only take a social loss of reputation because it has not detected the criminal acts of the nurse in time, but also now pay a high compensation sum calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé stated that the first crime went back in August 2009 and that he had continued to kill.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients in the elderly home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally investigated the deceased, but the formalities were addressed by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The director of La Caritat denied this point round and stated that "remaining measures could never have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat’s attorney added that “there are no indices in the dispute for the acts of a person other than the accused.”
He had already been baptized as a "Death Angel" yesterday and declared the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and had killed the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he had given a mixture of various calming agents.
The director of La Caritat explained that the access of staff to the drugs is only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the relaxing cocktail used the nurse in six out of nine crimes to free the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will be found whether Vila is lying and actually chosen a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it out of the inside by giving them blade, as he had done in confession with three women who killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the statements of the nurse, not even regarding the number of alleged murders, which could be quite more; this attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it has no meaning to change his actions after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say they have made it available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these cases of justice.
The European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors responded firmly to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our response capabilities."
The risk increases of the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB is able to deceive itself and that the euro has barely been assigned to points, which causes concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market, which, to the extent that it breaks, recovers, but as a result of the closing of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to revoke our liquidity measures, which the ECB must revoke tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably even a few more times in the future.
The Federal Bank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of state debts as they are ineffective, as well as the cancellation of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures; it should only be maintained a weekly unlimited access.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and retained the quarterly tender with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program to continue purchasing bonds and a stronger signal will be issued.
If the expectations created are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets will be rejected from yesterday, and if the neck is endured to take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Like at the ECB meeting in May, when the Bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of state debt papers and then the markets collapsed, this story could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government’s asset administration was only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 base points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the numbers of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be approximately 10 million in the short term and potentially another 15,000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or to be reputed by these banks.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government has to receive the parliamentary approval of its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have adequate support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discussion on the summit of the Heads of State and Government on December 14, where political unity has been asked to show that we play the same partition together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries are the ninth Beethoven symphony.
The Spanish President proposed yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Retirement reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of state deficits, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures, which sounds in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has added 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is an important auction of a three-year-old State debt that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we put on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt capability.
For Spain, applying for a help plan would be self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The shadow sum has €40 billion available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are too expensive and access to the markets would be closed without time.
However, our strategy should match Caesar's wife's motto: "Now it counts not only the being, but also the being."
Only courage, we can do it!
Eulen’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, on request of his children, defeated Vega Sicilia’s Association of Societies
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not fall.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate basket, will accuse El Enebro's joint venture assembly, which will take place on request of five of his seven children on 16th, as he considers them "absolutely neglected". His children will try to get a majority to the management bodies of the company - owner of the wine property Bodegas Vega control Sicilia -
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their dispute about the control of a part of the corporate group.
The founder of the largest holding for corporate services does not seem to be willing to give in his legal dispute the control of El Enebro’s institutions.
He was sent out of the Board of Directors from five of his seven children, and they were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders’ Assembly of 18 January this year, which has already been registered as contested in the Trade Register.
The joint venture assembly of El Enebro, appealed by the judge of the Trade Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new strike in the fall of the Álvarez family.
The Judge's call for the assembly to be summoned is the only legal way to ensure the assembly of the shareholders.
The last strategy by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicant - his five children - to explain, through legal superiority, fraudulent makers and legal abuse, the unexplained assembly of Jan. 18th, as well as the general public.
This argument is the basis for the allegation of the assembly later, to explain it as "absolutly neglected".
The same protagonists, who climbed in discreet silence, already tried injured in June to call for a meeting on a judge’s way.
At El Enebro – asset company and owners of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, along with other assets – David Álvarez’s seven children control 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group requires the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the matter that the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the complaint, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
Cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull 2004 has ended into the world of Formula One, its history has been characterized by the speed of surprises and successes in this experienced universe.
Initially, no one gave attention to the newling, and despite his steady rising turnover during the last seasons, they all put on the Ferrari victory at the final track last November.
Without the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel’s ability to reduce the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens had put in the hands of Red Bull has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes not related to authors.
This PLM computer science program has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy factories and high-precision tools.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is designed before it is actually built to avoid such errors and excess costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of the Siemens Industry Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull Factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are detected on the race and tests.
Russwurm suggests that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the racing sites, which could introduce up to three or four improvements in a season.
At Red Bulls team, 180 highly qualified young people are employed today. With powerful PC systems, they perform analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
Siemens manager said the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull’s racing car, except for the engine, which is solely responsible for Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality in less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on its competitions in a season.
Red Bull built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a 50km from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's real Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drinking manufacturer puts in the services of his participation on the racing tracks, other protagonists hide, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey, head of technology, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the R&E field of racing cars contributed to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85% of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by TV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) introduced his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of 20 stores with 80 to 100 square meters each, which is intended to open the Multi in the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees to this initiative with the already existing 16 sales sectors in multi-brand business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, named as an example the rebuilt store at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP worked for thirty years.
The North American company group intends to establish 200 sales sites in Europe by 2010, of which 20 establishments in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Russia) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming new openings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The Deputy Chairman, who is also CEO of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of the opening of the store is always the same, relying on a local dealer with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group advises this and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch). All shops in Europe will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of the store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales site network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice from small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing and afterwards, yes even packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the Technical Centre in Maastricht (Holland).
“In this way, we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days in ten minutes.”
“This system was designed specifically for small and small businesses and private customers, as large companies have already had their technical customer service contracts,” Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants a million customers to ‘clude’ his rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell’s CEO, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first a new liquidity crisis and prophesy the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it expects a breakdown of interest rates that banks try to compensate with rising fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a still existing expert.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the coming three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guideline plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers – 700,000 if you withdraw the customers who will lose the bank – that is the big challenge that this bank is facing, because it has so far more attention to its business customers than their private customers.
This year, she has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers are more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, speak outerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with an annual accounting report.
Only a few banks have to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has made all of the banks’ plans aligned with each other.
This year, Sabadell will complete its guideline Optima set four years ago, which was initially designed to three years, but due to the market situation it was extended by a financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings are the main objective of the bank.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a "heavy" year "with a wide range".
The manager expects Spain to come out of the crisis "slowly".
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamentally for the survival of the banks.
Even if it appears that the war on passive - which is punished by the interest margin - will blow off the risk increases that the banks and the savings cashes have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, as a compensation for delaying profit margins will already be deducted from the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We haven't turned the hahn, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola added.
Banesto has already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to limit the award of long-term loans and increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks currently pursued the stategia to "high the fees", but "inside a competition-traced framework".
Sabadell’s guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
He is not free of charge to ensure that in Spain "biggest companies are needed."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He emphasizes that the need for capital is currently "enormous" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be cut into red figures.
He believes that the FROB can replace the monetary market with capital increases.
After he assured that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he confirmed the argument of some bankers who already prophesied a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be brought into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term funding can be achieved through repo transactions and thus take over the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that a fusion wave of savings can be reached and emphasized the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that the second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed. Cajasol's involvement in the Banca Cívica group cannot be seen as a second round, but it was an adjustment."
"The most part is completed. It may be that we have 13 or 14, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "was carried out as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the deadline that was not now established in the framework of the business plans with Banco de España in the past," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings cashes with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 to 75,500 million is a historically unlikely process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so we have fulfilled the basic agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta said, “there would be a series of unarmed opinions on the slowness of the process, which reveals uncertainty and absurdity,” because “Banco de España urges us to complete in a timely manner before the end of the year.”
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of Europe's strictest financing systems and "probably" all over the world, and added that those who doubt this did "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic conjunction we have to "do not worry" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings funds that have passed a "very significant" concentration process that will be implemented "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had been very good at the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to preserve the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions on the markets have caused a double response to the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, regulation of time labour companies, or withdrawal of EUR 426 support for unemployed workers, up to the privatization of 49 per cent of AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat, as well as 30 per cent of the state.
On the other hand, Deputy Governing Chief Elena Salgado, with the help of former Governing Chairman Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
Merkel’s position is not a mistake for her public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which collapses with the preservation of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
Due to the resistances in Europe, we begin to speculate in Germany over three possible ways of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south must leave the euro area.
The second is that the reintroduction of the German Mark - although it sounds rather according to Science Fiction - is supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50% of the population.
The third: a restructuring of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that override the requirements; the most possible payment setting of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is unique and has been distinguished for some time, so there is no excuse now.
First, in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government took a constitutional reform out of the arms to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the conflict between what Germany considered necessary (stretched tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country when Merkel overturned the decision to rescue Greece painfully.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel is coming out in the last October days with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable the rescue of a country and, at the same time, oblige private borrowers to bear part of the cost.
This position was designed as anti-European as it drives the Irish crisis and all of the following.
But their proposal, although something sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that doesn’t mean to overcome it.
It says to everyone that, although unpopular measures are now to be taken, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro since that date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area, where counter-trader countries can be severely punished, forcing to declare insolvency, and in this case the private sector must take part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we need to take a tough growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption measurement, improved productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative that is based on debt and buildings with huge holes in the payment balance, as indicated by Spain in tree seasons, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we wouldn't do it badly if we don't understand it.
It is not only about reducing the state deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by the spring 2013.
It appears that Zapatero has understood this too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after meeting the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) indicates that despite Merkel’s criticism, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has prepared her way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like something would change.
One of the possibilities considered is that we should not exclude the euro area full-blown with few trusted countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it has warned us.
Sports and regulations
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of the invention, but not the willingness to overcome a penalty.
The exclusion imposed by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink was lost on whether it was an outstanding act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As it is commonly known, the two players lost a few minutes before the match (her team had already earned clearly) time and played several fouls so that the judge showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will comply with the penalty prescribed at the next league against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA’s disciplinary committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widely used that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport - rules.
Part of the debate on the case presented backwards is that a team of football club Real Madrid (who gave in his hymn nobleness and honour and penalized his players for similar incidents at other times) played the main role, and to the dramatization of Mourinho, which added an episode more to his long history than theatral movement.
In any case, the debate is about whether it does not expressly contradict the principles of the practices prohibited by the Statutes, i.e. whether these acts constitute a rule-of-the-art environment; in fact, this approach deals with the Statutes of the Sports, but seems to have a sense of it.
In this case, the damage caused to the spirit of the sport should be investigated.
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the counterparts, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that competitors gain an unjustified benefit from the counter-team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we usually understand under false game or rule-round, because the turnover of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a penalty, but should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and the penalty was delighted.
Another question is what kind of advantage the opponents pulled out of the intentional fouls.
It should be emphasized that the rival has not been put into a more unfavorable position, nor have the benefits of the game played been healed, as the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue to play with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of unconscious advantage, as the team could also excrete at any time. In addition, the players with this approach receive a penalty and pass into the second card cycle, where they excrete with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear if this is really a benefit.
Finally, such approaches are not aimed at the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions to make the most possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case, the players wouldn’t want to be punished (this would actually be a clear case of rule default), they would rather want to choose when they would be subject to this.
They made a strategic decision without a punishment to escape or escape before them.
Although the boundary between the invention and the environment of rules is overwhelmed, I believe that this issue is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the polemy was caused by two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and due to the type of the pronounced rules transfer.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer offerings for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar leaves a lawn of reservations this year on 16 and 17 December.
The feasts paid by employees themselves extend. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, in the early evening, there is also a group event that will bring oxygen to Barcelona’s hosts and recreational business. But as a result of the economic crisis, they solve a price offensive to also include the customer segment that represents the large mass: almost everyone wants to eat between 20 and 30 lunches or a meal for lunch.
In order to make the accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvervester falls on a Friday) has put all orders in the week of December 13, resulting in a lawn of dinner reservations on two top days (the 16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have suspended group spending for budgetary reasons.
In order not to give up this tradition, many workers pay them from their own pocket.
Whatever the economy is, lowest prices are required, confirmed by the president of the Barcelona Guest Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the ceiling association does not expect to predict how the holidays will look this month.
"People think about it once before they book."
"They want to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he stressed.
The business will go well with those “to offer the quality at good prices with a good service,” he adds, calling us in mind that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why pricing is the strongest demand for €25.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it is found that the evening of December 17 leads to a collapse.
The Soteras Group says the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than €30 would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete deals between €25 and €35 to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which holds 16 guesthouses in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), led the property of the calendar to preferred reservations, even from early November.
“We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year’s prices with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros,” he said.
At AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, you don’t lose optimism after the revenue is blooming again and good since the second quarter, although focused prospects for the Christmas business are faced on a few days.
Sources of the company group highlight that the 18th is also an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the price heat. You have the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and instead want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies you can also see green springs, which is why employees are invited back, which gives the impression that the group dishes are back up.
On the side of the ceiling association Fecasarm (with combinations such as the club, restaurant and recreational association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomá, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are totally fairly "lively" although the customers "explore a maximum".
The fun on the holidays did not go down, no matter who paid.
The Pakistani Nuclear Program raises major concerns in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "fast than any other country".
Revelations of WikiLeaks confirm the relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence of the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, disclosed by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms which concerns the Pakistani atomic program Washington.
On the edge of the clear and juicy details that provide the documents about the content of the talks and the way of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not reinforced, but on the contrary "decreases", and that the instability of Asian country causes more nuclear weapons than any other country.
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but their item parts are stored to make their destruction difficult in a possible attack - prepare Washington for sleepless nights.
The following risks include Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to visiting former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones, “the closeness of some nuclear equipment to the area attacked by the Taliban, the likely distribution of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material.”
The large number of people involved in the nuclear signals and missile programs will no longer be considered as an outstanding reason for Russia.
"Pakistan has to suspend strictly credible staff to protect the nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs," said Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with the North American officials.
The new documentation revealed by Julian Assang’s Internet portal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in terms of nuclear dissemination decreases and increases the pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as “fruitful,” explains: “Often there is no transparency; we do not receive answers to aid offers or they are rejected.”
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that " despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit of the Supreme Military Commander, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clearify" the officer that "Pakistan's army has suspended its silent oversight of terrorist groups."
Searching for Wikileaks Chef
Obama appoints a high responsible for the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol gives a red warning about the trace and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which it is difficult to clarify the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" on Assange's "release and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
It is not new, it comes from November 20th.
She has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, the founder of WikiLeaks, also said, “the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange.”
The International Police Authority, headquartered in Lyon, France, issued the order on request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities received the power.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, "to temporarily arrest and deliver him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of any individual affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter for a arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is concerned.
Assang’s attorneys who published a letter informed them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer questions by video conference by Swedish authorities.
They also recalled that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was compared to the lawyer Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin, who received the corresponding approval.
“It is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution,” is accused in the letter.
As the world seeks for him - and his mother from Australia exalts her son's innocence - Assange stops at an unknown place, but does not quietly.
On Monday, he issued an interview to the head of the Time magazine via Skype from an uncertain location, asking for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomats who were spying on the UN and thus violating international agreements signed by the United States, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was convicted by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who referred to the request for resignation as "laughter and absurd."
“I’m not sure why we should pay attention to the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has charged a high responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators announce today.
Congress deputy Peter King, who will be chaired in the House’s National Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to capture their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, Canadian President Stephen Harper's adviser, had gone further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "killing".
"Obama had to turn it into a target drive and use an unmanned plane or something."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever has made it clear in the government is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not punishment is a very mild punishment,” he said to the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eyewitness to the Carod Nearby
The Republican leader allows the party to have a secret vote on its remaining in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the ninth time of an internal disruption in the rows of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the voting votes.
The party assistant is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient to the neighbour of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened as today as her mentor itself and not the same head breakdowns as other former currents.
This is why Esquerra’s leader tries to win the new critics with an instant, which would ensure his position until the next municipal election.
For the beginning yesterday, ERC’s more than 200 regional council members were able to speak secretly about their stays in the office.
With ballots, not with a lifted hand.
If the cardiologists wanted to miss a criminal record to the president, they could do so without having to fear repressions.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel with half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Carod Nearby demands more from the President than only to provide his office to the party. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the top organ of Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Board of Directors with a plan of action from now to May.
To this end, they expect to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the orientation will be presented to the Council on the 18th vote.
In return, he promises to present the Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party’s head is already considered a fact.
The party assistant of the ERC is the view that the "polyphonie" harms stability and he seeks to make the organization able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it to be supported by the party party party in exchange for different goals.
He counted five of them, two of whom were in front of him.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the involvement of new faces from the Carod’s environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC finally resign the full assembly principle as a functioning way.
In this way, he advocates a reform of the statutes that will allow Congress to hold with elected delegates.
From the ending of the full-assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, who has already fought for the occupied, at the last two congresses.
In fact, at the 2008 standing assembly, the party’s leadership was entrusted with the review of the full assembly principle at a congress that should address the reform of the Statute.
This date still stands out as infogle of the internal appearance of the past few years has not been advised to address this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors being on the layout, it could be time to re-enter this issue and end it forever.

China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
China’s representative at the COP16 said its country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon traces and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China will keep its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at the COP16, says.
At his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made huge efforts to reduce the carbon traces and transform its industry.
He concluded that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institutional building and support of pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the authorities of the state had worked with those of the Central State and the communities to achieve the energy saving goals, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multiannual plans have already been attacked or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he focused on the effective use of energy, which has been introduced in the last five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another project on the exchange of traditional lighting bars by energy saving bars, and another project on weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, Scientific Government Advisor on Climate Change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts would be much bigger than commonly assumed.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amount to six tonnes per person, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
The energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the past five years and is expected to take place further by 2020, he said.
Legal Exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panistic party party party has the right to contact the National Ordinary Commission and ask for the right to give him the right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party assistant of the PAN has the right to contact the National Ordinary Commission and to demand the right to him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint, Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken locally.
"This is an independent decision of the Ordinary Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to contact the Commission of Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case on the complaint so that a decision will be made by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he said it wasn’t time to think of 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiations table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was reinforced from the upcoming domestic vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"The (an alliance in 2012) is a subject that has never been at the negotiations table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he said.
The panic leader stated that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not scared of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best or best chairman to take the Acción Nacional for the next three years, and he therefore gave over the stafes "to the one to determine the Council."
"I am very unpleasant and open there, and I would be proud to transfer to each of the five the office of the party partyholders."
He predicted that the party's upcoming elections on July 4 will reflect in the next elections, although "it's not time to think of 2012."
"It is now about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which highlighted alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country, "so many hopes and blessings will be put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of demands."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI by President Felipe Calderón for his four-year discussion in the framework of his government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the cabinet,” he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government can make expressions like those he can make during his Auditorio Nacional discourse, because there was no oral ban in this country and even less a censorship.
Obama joins on Twitter in favour of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press on the adoption of this law," the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press on the adoption of this law,” Obama tweeted.
His short communication contains a cyber link to a more comprehensive document that invites the public to get in touch with their senators, as the vote of the law is immediately promoted.
“With your voice we are waiting for, it is time to listen to you,” he stressed.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law, except the expansion of tax reductions from Bush’s times and government funding would be extended.
Such blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could have an impact on the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Asking about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President-in-Chief Robert Gibbs said he trusted that, once the tax issue has been resolved, a schedule could be set for the rest of the projects.
“I think we have a lot of time...”
“We all agree that the tax issue must be addressed before the end of the year.”
“I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then we can plan the rest,” he said.
The president of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, said on Tuesday, "he would ask for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which allows the initiative to legalize undocumented students from Thursday in the Senate, would be more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American Dream, would legalize about 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not sixteen years old, while living in this country in the last five years and registered at a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the voices of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the representatives of the project organize an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn the initiative back.
The most controversial Republicans include Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would no longer support it at another opportunity.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet set his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk where the participants were strong for the story.
"What I understand with sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected from me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and at this opportunity Ti used the subtitle of the sex, explained on another occasion.
The finger in the wound... "is bringing us into difficulties," the Argentine writer embraced the audience, mostly composed of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at the Montero, at the Valencía, and Serragio May.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she devoted to Gonzalo Celorio, and afterwards marked Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells first person and is the protagonist who is looking for to know what a "woman" is, and goes from a doctor to a doctor, although she doesn't answer, but she gets tips for her story.
The infectious physicians are convinced: “Patience is not my strength, maybe that’s my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumaologists who broke her breath in the middle of the row, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalytic reveals the mystery: "The wound is truly open, the symbolic is the narve."
The main character of the story makes it easy and closes it, which “just learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist.” But she is convinced that the desire to the language and its falls mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a stunning story that he called “the praise of the invention,” and in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
He tells about a famous magician who touched the clouds, traveled far away men, or restored the dignity that was lost by a girl. The story made a return turn and reported about America, the great novel that it missed from the beginning to its own chroniclists, and he cited the story of the critic of Ero, Días del Cast.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), sought the predetermined witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination force that even ashamed the sense of shame."
However, he emphasizes that “it is the crazy and the liars who best imagine things,” and that is where reality and lies approach each other, where you no longer know what side of the story belongs to where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the ‘tradition Cervantes’.
"We have inherited from him to be what will be told."
When Mayra Montero was in the series, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the FIl’s invitation to the round table ‘The Finger in the Wound’ had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted their contribution to the great wounds of social violence that their country - as a whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a quiet, not intentionally planned commitment," she explained after she emphasized that literature communication and binding is built between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose post also “heavened the finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer”.
He noted that in a fast-living world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness are also running out of dogmatics, and it will forget that "a little no is behind every confirmation and a little yes behind every denial."
“To be in possession of our mind and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often mean to put the fingers in the wound and trouble those who feel much better when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in a pre-built world of ideas without nuances, and also encouraging the powers to nuance and encouraging them.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but he played crucial games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final game, there are also two different styles set by their respective coaches, and the encounter characterized by contrasts reflects in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he has had crucial games, and so far he has kept himself well, so this opportunity is very important for him.
The Argentinean played the second champion with the medal, remained a step behind the winners and surprisingly performed consecutive finals with the same team.
The Sanctuary Strategy reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when Del Morelia had in the hand of the trains with which he experienced a major defeat against Toluca 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003', he reached the decisive duel that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to get back again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros was uncertain after 210 minutes of play, but at the elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two possibilities to get into his title, but in the end, the three of his matches.
Rubén had already had two final games with Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, lost, so he doesn't want to be persecuted by the accident and get rid of the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important game for him is the game himself.
“I want to become a champion, I want to break no statistics, which is for a club, for my enthusiasm that I am giving, and that’s why the title will come to me, but what’s happening before is the most important,” the taxman said.
The last final game remained strong in memory, he assures him to have learned a lot of it: "The only teaching we can learn from it is that until the arbitrator does not end, we cannot celebrate, we are in the line, we are not prepared to do, the players are also, because the last time we were playing it, we weren't ready for it, we weren't ready for it.
Knowing that this series could be chosen by elfmeter shooting doesn't worry him because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there's no alternative and you need to be prepared for that we've been ready for something in the previous tour, we've been ready for this game, but sometimes we've got a lot of destiny.
It is in Romanso power to no longer be only a second champion and to cost the first time the titles bring with it.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must submit themselves before their conversation at the consulate at the service offices for visa application; costs will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa change in the United States Embassy and the Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must submit themselves before their conversation in the Consulate at the visa application services offices (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall collect the biometric data of the applicant, which is verified by the consul before the conversation.
The new process has certain benefits for aspirators, including:
The total cost for the settlement of the visa is reduced, since the termination language, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is issued is no longer required to pay separately.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterpart of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a visa application (including a visa for time workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk in the consulate, they only have to imagine at the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the Consulate remain there less than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service charge of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to propose a fund that will have the impact on the search for living beings in all tomorrow.
The U.S. National Air and Space Agency (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of alien life.
The fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, which examines the origin, development, distribution, and future of life in the universe.
At the press conference, NASA assured that it will present "a supervisory fund for searching for alien-dischemous life", which triggered speculations from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in hostile environments that were thought to be invisible until now, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was denounced that they could transform into intelligent living beings - such as humans - when their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found on the grounds of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for all the worldly life forms as the lake is very arsenal-containing.
In some ways, microbies use arsenal as a survival resource, taking into account this ability, the chances that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsen, according to astrobiologists, it has been proven that “the reality is a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from what we know.”
The Space Agency will announce the actual scope of its fund tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and by biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study the Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) in question whether his chemical composition is similar to the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patron form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organ Act on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
It had just begun the 60th legislative period, and an opposition block was already installed, led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent man, and the four asked the following: the entry of the two-party system into the Chamber.
Before the 60th legislative session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo were opposed to the reform of the Organ Law as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeatedly, it would introduce a "double-party system" because now there would be two people the same number as the parties that controlled Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency appointed as Vice-President by the Panists Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties with these reforms had institutionally introduced their political standpoint.
He said they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI in the next few days to change the scheme, and if they had left their political will and if they had not, they would be re-submissed by both parties to put an end to the opposition coalition.
“To this end, I come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I see, because we’re being excluded from all decisions that don’t even take into account the opinion of the others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that there would therefore be a pluralistic group.
It cannot be admitted, he continued that the Congress, after he was monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform to rule an everlasting two-party system in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five members and they speak with other colleagues to make them more," the Convergencia member said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT suggested on PAN and PRI that the Congress has now turned into a 'beauty' for two.
“It was just a party before, now they divide it into two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked the Members to respect and assign their position to the negotiating table.
"The five who are currently divided into different groups are not allowed to be left outside due to top decisions, five who are likely to be nine Members, and the five who are now divided into different groups have decided to join us to take our place at the negotiation table because they have been reformed and extended by the others, and we have not stayed outside."
200 000 Peso More for "the Supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the contested owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check over a little more than 200,000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electric material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 peso.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, this check issued at an amount of 200,144,56 Peso was issued with the number 9258447 last November 16 with the purpose of using "open bills".
Treasury master Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money from the municipality would go to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe it and, consequently, the number of checks that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased with her, it's just going to pay the debts, just as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "duck" in the last quarter of the year "repeat": September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the Treasury assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste on July 25 published the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was known that before, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010 during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks at Camacho Palazuee.
There were also stores with Jumapam, where they took checks worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in the invasion of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in bad condition and throw a bad image to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, reminded that, at various occasions, it was requested to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the roads and walks had negatively impacted as tourists came to land and saw the disturbance, after which they would turn the nearby stores to the back.
“The politicians don’t know what it means to close a company one day and they don’t care about how much money you lose because otherwise they wouldn’t carry out the construction work slowly and unplannedly.”
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the breakthrough of the tourist would have taken note of the lack of prevention and remaining maintenance on the sides of the city.
He said, “The church must take responsibility and avoid that which is happening once again. How should they do it? Now by prevention, rather than afterwards, to improve everything.”
"We are looking forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it has to be maintained, we also have the right to a clean living area. The city administration has to change its strategy to maintain the city in a good state."
"There are other places that also look unpleasant and unprepared," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito from Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions are constantly on fire," he added.
“These measures have not been paid enough attention and this kind of incidents just make it obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently necessary.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, deputy secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be properly used and let a bad image be created.
He mentioned a number of places to be brought to front with the city, to make the city clean, ordinary and attractive for tourism, should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that must first be spaced and cleaned in order to make them attractive to tourism and bring them to the inventor we advertise for this destination.
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that Members should take great responsibility to give an example of a better sinaloa facing many challenges.
The company industry of Mazatlán calls for a decent parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is excited and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th parliament was introduced. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and another of the PVEM. It consists of a total of 40 people representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean work, to feel committed to society and to the various social groups that are dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members should take great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
"We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right to act free from agreements between the parties, because it is common to conclude agreements with which they represent their own interests, which will transform them into carnival companions of the governors and the leaders of parliamentary groups."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to undergo the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy work and work for society and their groups, because they were the residents of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, says one of the major challenges facing the 40 people’s representatives is the drive and the joint work for the state’s economic growth, since today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote the creation of jobs.”
With regard to the tourism industry, he urged the new Members to allocate the necessary priority in the state budget to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understood that it is the ministry with the two-sixest means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings currencies and investments into the country and is in direct competition for the agroindustria."
Tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been resumed in previous legislative periods, must be put to the latest level.
The Holy King is looking for
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys, the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family wish to see.
For parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next three-day day, because the household is no longer and no less than twelve people and a cowboy.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isa, José Juan and Miguel do not give the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toy and the clothes they look like this.
The family lives a humble house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
“Occasionally hard times are reported because my husband has no job, but we sell Mandarins and Potatoes... Even in the afternoon I go with the Gören to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a puppy or a bike while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie puppy.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has long wanted to have a "monster car" and for his eight-month old brother Jesus proposes Cayetana clothes in size for one year.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy, because it was very expensive,' Cayetana sadly remembered.
For older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Heiler King will be searched' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers are arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the breakdown of a production and sales network of cannabis, the ten domestic examinations in the administrative region of Estrie were conducted.
Fourteen people were arrested and various charges were filed.
The home examinations took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly drug production.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated,” Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Quebec Security Police, said.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of the men who are considered to be the main conductors of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The detained persons are expected to have appeared hours after their arrest before the court building in Sherbrooke.
You may, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, its property for sales purposes, the complot and the service of crimes.
These home examinations had been carried out as a result of a long-term investigation, which had been delayed for more than a year.
“The information received from public hand has enabled us to carry out these arrests,” said M. Ruel.
For the 70 police officers of the regional detective unit, Estriens of the security police of Quebec, the police service Sherbrooke and the police authority of Memphrémagog had participated in this operation.
Secret immigration could be easily pursued
The draft legislation of the Conservatives to address the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants is expected to be implemented after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they are unable to support the proposal.
“I’m rejecting this charter with insistence.”
"I stand with a party that has put you in prisons," said Michael Ignatieff, Chief of Liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucus meeting before the meetings.
The Liberals argued that the draft law, which allows any person to be arrested by a ship identified to be transported as illegal immigrants for up to one year, violated the Canadian constitution of law and freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, Chief of the Bloc Québécois, also argued not to be able to support the draft law as he turned against the wrong target group.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government takes,” Duceppe said.
The criticism of the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the critics by hand asking that their party was not resistant enough to the secret immigrants.
“The Neo-Democrates agree to take measures against blind passengers, and that’s what we try to implement by mediating another draft law, the C-35,” Chow said.
Therefore, we do not support the Conservatives’ bill because he seeks for refugees and holds children in custody for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The Canadians interfere with the Members that they do not tolerate this type of secret immigration, these criminal proceedings that concern Canada and treat the country as a foot-and-foot representative.”
"They expect Canada to take harsh measures," said Minister Kenneys.
“The government has not announced any voting of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a Conservative expressed against the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that every opponent would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find a consensus
Despite the announcement of the establishment of a new, standing unit for combating corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the formation of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, argues that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New Yorker Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has been standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than just surprised one.
It must be said that this measure was not at least discussed in the event of the meeting of the Quebecer Permanent Committee of the Police Service on October 29 last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also missing that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and a member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement in pointo public security as a "shaved cane" and "a right-of-the-art solution."
Minister Dutil, on the other hand, had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the questionable future unity.
"They will see the result when we will announce it," he pleaded to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
“The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to form a research committee is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State High School for Education of Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this sackgase, he proposes to Quebec to assign a special mandate to the Financial Audit Control so that it can carry out investigations related to corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of auditing," he said.
He also represents the view that Quebec of audit control could grant the same power as Commissioners, whatever it would allow them to oblige people to make statements.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government’s shuttles.
Quebec is also required by Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better resolved against such crimes.
This inquiry is derived from the Supreme Attorney of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the legal practice in this type of prosecution is not clear.
On the other hand, Vic Toews, Minister of Public Security, confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently sitting together with certain reports regarding this dossier.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, which concerns the groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people were arrested, although the criminal law had not been novelized.
Ottawa has implemented the law against Gangstertum.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several river runs remain strictly monitored because of the high precipitation that has fallen in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, it came to an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road is crushed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, severe rainfall from 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation have fallen in several regions.
A further 20 to 40 millimeter precipitation was expected here according to the regions until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimeters of rain sawers fell here.
Since it is still necessary to add to these rains the snow melt that has already accumulated in certain subregions, the overthrow of several water runs is feared.
On Wednesday night, the Quebecer Security Service has been warned about the flood alert concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière are here as the object of flood surveillance and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, the severe precipitations have moved to the overlap of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an outbreak bridge was continued due to the strong rainfalls.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the passage of certain lakes has caused the closing of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains ready for alarm and monitors the situation closely, says security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebecer Land Shochwater Center has, on Wednesday, issued warning of the strong rise of several rivers, particularly by Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont allocated partly
The Quebecer radio moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse in front of the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) due to its controversial statements on social security and Haitians as well as due to its explicit radio speech.
The CCNR represents the opinion that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, but some statements "have contained unreasonable information about social care and unjustly negative representations of the Haitians as well as such unrecognized speeches that are not appropriate for broadcasts throughout the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide violated the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during broadcasts during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first provision was filed as a result of a complaint from the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurately.
The moderators should rather provide solid information as misleading.
With regard to the theme of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had the opinion that suicide was an expression of fiction.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had drawn the conclusion that the message provided was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crisis.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the implications of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" had adjusted a sensitive subject in a more familiar and appropriate manner."
Hence, he was not treated with any tadel against his person.
The last dispute point concerns the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had provided a media-efficient discussion that caused a lot of reactions in this regard.
The CHOI moderator had stated not to have donated for the help of Haiti, as you wouldn’t know if the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments have not been abusive characters, but that their cumulative effect is an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
“I have already suspended my three-day suspension punishment in this matter.”
"My document has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Council urges the dissemination of an unholy expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio broadcaster has acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, inter alia, had to communicate his decisions once during the main end period within a three-day period, are small.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, brilliant in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickbox as well as in the Thai box, now rises in search of new challenges to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as kung-fu and kickboxen," Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, explained to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all-places, because for those who do not like the ground fight, such as the mixed fighting arts, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, the UPS, who worked as a security official, and employed the UPS, had made his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, between October 23 and 30.
"I have the victory in the categories of the full contact kickbox and the Thai box achievements," he explained.
“I’m currently preparing for the San Shou World Cup in China.”
“They were invited to fighters from every category who had been among the first four at the last world championship.”
"I got babe in 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"I've been back in Vietnam in 2005."
"I finished the tournament in China in 2007 on fifth place while I became third in Toronto in 2009.
“It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition.”
“With this rhythm I will be the first this time or next year!”
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China in which faults and footsteps as well as soil crashes are permitted.
The two battles usually play on a platform, rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer that came from this kind of combat sport is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, known in the world of combat art.
If Nacer had only one event in his career, he would definitely call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," the sympathetic pund screen said.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a super experience."
Seven times in the semi-final of his category (80kg) he had won his first battle before he then lost in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four counterparts per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"The winners of each category offer the heads to crown a single champion, the King of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has approved $450 million in mutual agreement project planning companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle Rupert project.
In the middle of this Lawine of more than 100 contracts, there is a consortium consisting of companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the main share, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a companion to the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector, to overreach its responsibility to this important hydroelectric project, amounting to a sum of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Consortium "Energy Management" approved the lurative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois Party, the intervention on corporate consortium is a serious ethical problem that prevents the risk of distortion of competition and price rise.
“This is a new way of a decarded game and strengthens the competition.”
“This means that you are now performing in a secret way rather than in a carded game,” Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, told the press conference yesterday.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public’s interest can be used in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by placing vehemently in decree that this contract would have negotiated a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, encouraging the PQ to be "unreasonable" and "feeling her hardening."
She said that it was "the least" that the PQ would apologize.
The model of the consortium is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise with regard to a tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in relation to its work dimension.
The construction process is in ongoing and will be set up by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was forgiven without the possibility of a competition; negotiations had already been held.
In addition, the model of the Consortium in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects, is no longer an exception.
As noted last week by the newspaper "Le Devoir", the model applied in the field of construction engineering and consultancy is the subject of government mediation of the consortium.
A brief overflow of the Quebecer corporate register allows you to designate more than 200 consortiums, some of which appear to be permanent.
This way, for example, Dessau works together with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any linkage, and there are several dozens, leads to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Energy gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James has been subject to a special workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has to take this into account in particular since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), issued a statement that made the nose sharp about the fact that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
“If you make a tender and there are only few candidates, your prices will be faster.”
“So you have two options: either you take the people on this march and say to you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.”
“The idea, however, is that the price is not crucial, but the person’s intelligence,” the report confirmed.
This contract approved by the Consortium of Energy Management is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the Québécois Party.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or by the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineers and consultants contracts, which were authorised by companies or their branches, including in particular resources laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had had 22 contracts on its own, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without computing their participation in "Energy Management".
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344 including the contract with "Energy management" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti Libéral du Québec probably known."
Minister Normandeau had accused the PQ of being equally linked to the companies they "financing" before she precisely said it was more about their leaders.
Barometer production conscious consumption - The "green" label is not trustworthy
Greener, but unprecedented skeptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little in the marked brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
Shame, although it baths in a media-effective universe where it blows information in favour of a more responsible consumption: the responsible consumption of the barometry has a lack of credible information to complain, an insufficientness that makes it evident as a brake of his commitment, as the first reading showed.
Although they have advanced the consumption of so-called socially tolerated products in 2010, Quebecers, however, appear to be less taxable for those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebecer’s population admits, in fact, to give as little faith in the environmental commitment of companies as the green business activity, according to the measurement instrument, which is outlined by the responsible consumer center at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates, to which the possibly fair products are added, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious.
According to the same pattern, the political discussion on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecer population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this segment, which is currently living by nearly one-third of the Quebecer consumers.
In fact, vacuum and doubtful character of information pushed the jealousy of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of the quebecers of the specified performance of the green products and services that they are trying to put in their hand are miserable.
According to another statement, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to barometers, they also preferred purchases from traders in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and responsibly aware - the environmentally conscious consumption index had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the home consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of the recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of the animal protection.
However, the social and ecological consciousness seems to stop its car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the co-computer to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The ride and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive conduct survey that feeds the climbing presentations.
State debt for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, requested by Société Angus and the company Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the Parallele company, who had expected a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the eXcentris cinema complex belonging to Daniel Langlois at the Boulevard Saint-Laurent to overcome this again of his actual cinematic function, seemed to be unable to receive what they had requested.
The government has agreed to engage in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebecer government offers a debt in less than the initially expected amount, which could create an existential solution to beneficial conditions, at least according to the sources that are recoverable from state rumours.
A first action plan, as well as a request for 12.8 million, has already been rejected by Quebec last spring, which has been summarily corrected back to bottom since the year.
A proposal, along with a plan of action, has already been sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des Entrepreneurs Culturales (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris Act.
A few days ago, he had sent her a last case report.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallels and Angus now have time to answer them until 31 December.
In any case, the premises of the State donations seem to have been really pushed to the side.
Remind us that the Quebecer community of the cinema owners and the cinema complex had rejected a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by submitting the argument that the cult minister had no financial assistance for real estate projects that he did not allow to come to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants of the segment complained about substantial economic aid.
After the film’s self-financed construction for ten years, Daniel Langlois had presented the author’s cinema in the rooms of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the state cakes.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients on the band.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallel with Christian Yaccarini at the top, on its own, manage a privately funded campaign, from which they expect a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one waist has continued to show movies in eXcentris, namely Le Parallele.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three film halls on February 27 next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the corrected proposals you have made to them.
The Secret of the Complex Successful Canada
The new U.S. diplomatic guidelines spread by WikiLeaks were the secret of what the United Nations considers under the Canadian minority complex to the Americans, but with the same strike they open the feeling of superiority to Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters don’t have the Canadian-American relations in their elections, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were published publicly yesterday, offer even more picant details than the only substantial content to be climbed on.
A link dated on September 22, 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was full-time, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participate in the political leaders discussed.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers a variety of explanations for this situation.
"A Canadian low-value complex may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about internal disputes of everyday life than the United States to impose the black Peter (such as 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he said.
The United Nations, he concludes, is therefore "the spoken goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The Ambassador understands this "order-successful silence" less than ever since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he said, "shall it be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party head to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the sense of the urnength."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the statement sent by Terry Breese, CEO in Ottawa on January 22, 2009, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the government’s continued existence at the federal budget voting at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created due to a $30 to $40 billion excitement program,” Breese said.
He had never mentioned that the government had to delay the Parliament meeting before Christmas to prevent Parliament from falling out of the coalition and the so-conditional existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed livelihood programme.
Another message dated from January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, Washington agrees with the increasingly negative image that the broadcasts over CBC spread dramatically from the United States.
The Ambassador is worried about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can observe little subtle allegations to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also defeats for the purpose of the CIA's muscle process of hearings.
Another statement further reports how Hillary Clinten asked at her French official colleague Bernard Kouchner on their first bilateral meeting whether Europe is willing to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he issued a paper to the Secretary of State in point Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the act again."
Finally, let’s note that the humids are warming up with regard to WikiLeaks’ website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close counselor Stephen Harper, said over CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killing".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide Plan for Renewal of Lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly one-third of the additional reduction needed to be realized to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations by developing countries.
According to the yesterday plan, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKWs issued to Earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white flowered birds, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or even better, by light diodes (LEDs).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is an equivalent of 70% of the global railway park’s gases.
Last year in Copenhagen, large emissions emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were committed to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce global FC Car emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance must be removed from 5 Gt to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent this from being out of control.
In the white-flashing berries, 95% of energy weighs in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce light.
With the compact fuel bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced again by double.
The compact fluorescent bars hold on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED lights, such as those that Philips produced this week - this company has participated in the U.N. study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white lighting lighter, providing an explanation of the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that ice completely newer lamps only give very little heat, they can also work with a regular resistance.
And they do not contain any cheese silver.
Several specialists have shown that compact fountains have reserves because they contain silk and therefore need to be removed as a special mill, which is not always possible in developing countries except for producers to provide an admission site.
However, according to the report, the main source of silk emissions on the planet is not the compact air bulbs, but rather the carbon power plants that emit much more silk bulbs in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white bulbs.
Only in the United States these coal power plants explode 25,000 tons of coal silver annually.
The report describes in detail the profits each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars per year when purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 coal power plants, the construction of Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Elfenbein coast expects to announce election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Elephant Coast Presidency elections immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent election commission to maintain their work and to announce the preliminary results without further disruption," a press spokesman of the UN chief said.
"He calls on all parties and institutions of the Elfenbein Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to include each initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results."
Despite the pressure carried out by certain foreign governments, the election commission had made the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CEI's president on television confirmed that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, several calls from all over the world have been heard, but the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the Laurent Gbagbo separating from the office and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of "fraud" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed push in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Chairman of the Elephant Coast Presidency Campaign, had confirmed that the UN conducted manipulations to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had threatened the president's supporters to go to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more of the view that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who abstained from any connection to the former rebels, considered the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he hasn't gone so far to demand victory.
His allies confirm, Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results as he knows he has lost; and lodging a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission has prevented the publication of the results is very illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the union and reconciliation process of a country, which had been divided into two parts over the years.
The United Nations had warned the politicians of the Elephant Coast on Wednesday that they could be held responsible in case of any excuses.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first voting round on October 31 with 38% of votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolitan area, is stable at 9.3% (including overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the provisional seasonal adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployed figure in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The second quarter figures were 9.3% of the employed population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% of the departments' involvement in the overseas.
During the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
Initially, 3.4 million employers of the French metropolitans were not employed in the third quarter but wished to find a job, including whether they were employable or not every two weeks or whether they were job-seekers.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% under the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
In addition, seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% involving the departments overseas.
Only the 25-49 years were able to benefit from unemployment stability in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolitan (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France in general.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Federal Bureau of Statistics Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment numbers since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union Statistical Office, continues to continue in this method and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53-year-old, director of an eradication company and brother of the Chairman of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and initiated in the course of a investigation procedure on the public and suspicious markets in jail in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of undergoing social assets, disobedience to generals, disobedience, misconduct in corruption, unauthorized detention and arms possession, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is willing to express himself on all questions that the prosecutor will ask him, rather than spreading brainspins."
“It’s easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them,” his AFP attorney Florence Rault (Agence France Presse) said before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialist) in the department, had emphasized to give the judge a memorandum on his justification by means of his lawyers before his hearing.
A Guérinis family, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than his deponie that he had to lead to keep on running.
He would never have known about the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, according to Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Balling Room Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday for submission and complicity, but then, under the law, to stay away under the judicial supervision of the protagonists of these acts, again on foot.
"My client was able to provide explanations about the facts that were appealed to him."
"The chief state attorney has taken into account not his freedom of speech," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released from prison in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said Vice-Government Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted in court due to "unlawful influence and passive coverage".
Two state officials of the balloon room Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one due to the title "Inhibition and defeat of general by an official of the public service", the other due to "committeeship in defeat of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini’s companion Jeannie Peretti was also accused of “healthy and undergoing social assets.”
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent makers from public hand that had affected Corsica.
The catchers suspected his society to have helped wash money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X on alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, particularly in the removal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
A close source of investigation shows that the investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the addition and operation of a depot in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the area of Aubagne, as well as from certain cities of the urban inlet area of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Rice: the Elysée Palace exceeds its mediation function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Riiss, a young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "spionage", breathed in the French public, pushed the diplomacy into alert preparation and emphasized the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the U.S. diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" highlight some backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how Elysée had explained his strategy to the Americans to give this advice to deal with their own "acquisitions" crisis in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner held in France and sought by U.S. justice for trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they set the way the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media with the purpose of making it credible to the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Rice into a bright light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited on August 12, 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with imprisonment".
François Richier, Elysée’s strategic counselor, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They advised the Americans to do their best to bring back their own citizens who would be violently arrested in Iran.
"Power noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without discomfort" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "speak release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to his image.
“Do this more, especially because the Iranians ask you not to do that.”
Because "Silwige nothing solves," the discussion attempts passed on inseparable ways, the Iranians are "Masters in Ausweichmanov".
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is a "reliable, Iranian tactic": "detention for the purpose of political oppression".
He announces the release of Clotilde Rice from prison (which should come on August 16, on the day she fled to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro deposit).
And he makes it allegable that Elysée antispyrates other imprisonments, a phenomenon that will "great up."
“The Iranians could in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Rice was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still detained in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery is required by the United States due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison, according to the decision of a judge in Paris.
The U.S. Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this alarming coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition by the material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow deal?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In the event of a re-interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to oppose it.
“There has been a rainy exchange between the French presidency and the French Justice Minister” (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot change the judicial decision,” he explains.
Mr Richier also wants to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "stretched" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, he reiterated, then informing the American diplomat, the Iranian, who "is currently in the buildings led by the Iranian embassy in Paris."
During the arrest of Clotilde Rice in Iran, Elysée does not deprive its efforts to believe in "flight attempts" organized by the media, which Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influenced middle-roll".
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 complains of "the media blast of the French authorities".
On which basis is so much "Thanks" to Mr Assad, the Paris message asks.
“In spite of their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have done.”
The document then addresses the reasons that the Elysée has made to fall into this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he analyzes.
A 2008 policy launched, which was then "perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as an early and inexpensive".
"Building the Syrian role" Paris is trying to lead Syria in front of the eyes of what reward can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region.
It also aims to "seed conflict between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told her: “Of course, we don’t know whether the Syrians have done anything.”
“We have thanked them, despite everything.”
"This should at least cause confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Riiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée.
In a communication, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will approve a law called the Aschenbroad, which will prohibit youth from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill that calls on online gaming operators to refuse access to these games after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, pictured representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
“Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with living a normal life throughout the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a ministerial representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse, said in a statement.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
Producer companies have had a long time to prepare for the application of the law, he precisely said.
The government also insists on requesting the manufacturers to lower the time limit given daily for access to these games to those youths whose parents are asking for this, the responsible said.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events related to intensive internet use.
The country is also an unveiled champion in global online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea had achieved four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the executive country
In light excitement due to corruption suspicion, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the judges of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a high political election in which the rankings for influence and lobbying threaten the technical criteria in the background.
However, one thing is certain: the edition of 2018 of the royal discipline of FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The edition of 2022 will then be slightly more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Catar, Australia) for itself after the 2010 premiere on the African continent, or to continue its establishment in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch government chief, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the degree of economic and political engagement of a world championship.
Therefore, the machinations behind the caves are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was conducted by the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could also well ruin the chances for their own country, a game of football, which could only have to bear the world championship once, namely 1966.
The BBC had given it again on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report taking into account three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
There is enough reason to embarrass the FIFA and to embarrass the English officials who had been primarily lobbying with David Cameron over the past few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the shackle that had succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be sufficient to re-evaluate England's image before the Committee?
Nothing is less safe because the Duo of Spain-Portugal is missing in traumas with its already finished stages, its expertise (M 82 in Spain, the 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could push their ambitions.
The potential repressions against the British as well as the doubts about the Solvence of Spain and Portugal will increase Russia’s chances, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiens, hotels, transport) have become heavy outsides.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to oppose the unexpected explanation of the authorizations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"They're promoting them with damnation, they're trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, reinforced by the 1994 experience, appears to be the logical favorites.
The first global economic power, headquarters of the FIFA chief sponsors, appears to show a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea that have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat is the FIFA’s warm approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will cause Asian opportunities to be hit by 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all records with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA pursued its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries make a greater risk, as certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could have suffered from the weakness of the rights of television (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: Openness
De Gaulle had really been sick.
Midrand had let him believe that he was short.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least doubts.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not on the side of the mystery that holds the presidential function.
So you have to do as if the doubt exists.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the followers Jacques Chiracs announced that a third mandate was not excluded without even believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone to make his decision "sometimes in autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would accuse the prospect of "two mandate" on Tuesday night in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians, was therefore a little spread of fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
It's missing a lot.
The President just reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year periods of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time he mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
“You’ve got the worst seven and a half years with me, or best,” he told them in July 2009.
In May 2010, a new report said, “Don’t believe that I’m not thinking about the phase after that.”
His words from yesterday do not make him a candidate more than yesterday, but not less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the competition around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy drives to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which many members of the PS urge to fight earlier than assumed.
Bad surveys on the other hand.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer a candidate by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs 44%, according to a survey of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it," the Prime Minister responded immediately and carefully.
"If he could have been defeated, he would not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has met with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to retain its purchases of state papers
The last meeting of the Central Bank of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to its conclusion at the end of the year.
The European State Debt Crisis is committed to the fact that the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot undoubtedly impose the current, more than stressed situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their deterioration.
Political costs would be too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in favour of solving Europe's state debt.
She did not dare to say whether she believes that the Central Bank could do even more, for example by encouraging her programme of procurement of state debt.
"I keep my considerations for my European trade partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels, on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, had not been very well spoken about his projects, but rather pleased to point out that the program of the procurement of state papers on the secondary market would be considered to be "extended from the day of the assembly" and "which we are going to operate".
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its line unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the taxation purchases of the Treasury Chamber were doubled by the ECB last week to approximately €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of some traders, it is expected to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among the traders, the anticipation of a further purchasing course will not be doubted (see page 29).
The farmers are no longer expecting a remarkable change in the course.
If debt transactions of more than three months are already gone out of the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be created in a free-life manner, for a period of one week to three months.
People's farmers are already making sure that this measure will extend in a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its program in a substantial manner."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," Michael Schubert, Volkshost of the Commerzbank, said.
"A progressive rise planned for the course of the first quarter 2011 seems more likely to me," Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that live the market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the relevance of the European banks’ exposure to the debt markets in the eurozone, the Central Bank has no other choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"They have to go to the market at any price of the lacking investors and act in such a way to prevent the rapid excitement of the returns paid to the weakest states," an important bondholder said yesterday.
Because if the interest rates were used for high flight, the States would even more prevent their debt from reducing or just stabilizing.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The government of Berlusconi will cover Italy
After a week-on-week start for Italy, the situation has slightly relaxed with the decline in anchor rates to 10 years.
A return to the fake silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economics, the region’s President Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as a “unpredictable” and had heard it with a “unpredictable” weekend, but immediately denied it.
On Tuesday, at least, the Scherre with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for covering the competition risk have risen to 263 points, causing some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi noted at his Ministerial Council that Spain’s discrepancy on the German interest rates is at 400 base points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as “hearted” by the “market turbulence” and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, folklor at the Hudson Institute.
Its problem is the absence of economic growth and the consequence of rapid tax revenues that threaten the state to no longer meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels predictions were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although this is expected to be reviewed by the Senate's budget of 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (in comparison to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the disruption of a new budget collective, which could be spent on a sum of €7 billion after the holidays.
"When necessary, new savings must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
Currently, Italy receives support from international institutions.
“The main firms of Italy’s economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have repeated for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who has trusted IMF with Italy.
“There are no problems at the moment, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), requires less stabilization progress than other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD’s Chief People’s Farmer.
The question remains in politics.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a request of misconfidence from the House of Deputies, resulting from which the preferred elections could be organized at the end of March.
Therefore, there is a slightly favorable period for a decision-making on a severe crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anti-crisis measures after
Christine Lagarde expressly stressed this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: “I believe that it has been proven on Sunday morning and evening: Europeans are clearly together, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.”
Although totally relative - the withdrawal recorded yesterday at the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the moulds of governments and the ECB.
However, from the beginning of normalization, it cannot be the speaker yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt rating, which is probably the most effective target drive of speculators today.
"As in May there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly burdensome on the banking systems," the exane BNP Paribas folk farmer said.
Especially because "political time passes much slower than the markets".
The European countries, which are aware of both the climate and the dangers they hide therein, are likely to intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly affected finance ministers and the G20's counterparts continue to progress well.
And this also in terms of the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan stands for the loss of non-conventional measures to strengthen the rear of the Eurozone countries in the crossing of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU stability fund, its executive director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Fernost about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not expressive fundraising, he will certainly prepare the terrain for this.
The first public paper expenditure from the EU stability fund is intended for the next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the Reuters Agency entrusted that the United States supported a possible increase in the IMF fund’s additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are committed to adopting structural reforms, especially in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to the savings measures, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are a different way than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both one and the other must avoid demanding international assistance at any cost before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will give them confidence for a long time.
In turn, European investors are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the markets of State bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on his trip to Paris on November 24th, had first brought the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get into its own pocket again.
The people of Barclays Capital, as regards the European public debt market, whose priority is the actor, judge that an extension of €100 billion would be "preferably" sufficient in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This fund exists: the European mechanism for financial stability, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
A council that has all opportunities to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are met.
Snow and glance: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow episodes still draw difficulties in traffic, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Bretagne, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alarm level due to the threatening risk of snow and smoothness.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to 20 departments already in alarm level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowseekers tange the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it is lightly snowing on the Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, cutting ceilings are expected from 2 to 5 cm, as well as from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfalls are notable enough to cause traffic disability and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed for heavy transport of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the transport axis Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The situation of the secondary transport networks in Britain is very difficult, according to the traffic police who refuse to use their own vehicle only in emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses was deleted throughout the day.
In the Picardie, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for heavy transport on Wednesday night.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called for airlines to remove 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of their flights from Orly due to the expected severe snowfalls.
DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in South London as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skies
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France, it has rain billions.
At least in the discussions.
This is especially called for the 23 billion Metro Grand Paris, which will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the start of the SGP, the state has raised a capital donation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to allocate a part of the financial sum to its double in the markets.
Today, it finally came to the first high bills.
The supplementary budget of 2010, reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to allocate the first part of these funds.
These are two kinds of measures: the creation of a special tax for the production and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
First, as withdrawn by Article 15 of the draft law, it goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is said: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
Second, a re-arrangement of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it to increase its product and overcome this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This amount is not specified in the text.
From the four billion people are far away.
“It is expected that the tax resources will be added to the €4 billion of capital subsidies allocated by the state and made by the Société du Grand Paris for the project,” the statement said.
In the SGP, this system isn’t even worried.
“From the moment you book income (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then only generate the 4 billion,” it is explained.
"This is noted in the budget and downwardly."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to note the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four billion will still be able to seek for a long time, is in danger of a fairly moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rage Hacker and Emily Spy
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double significance.
On the one hand, she has revealed herself as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of shame that governs the relationships between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a pre-taste to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go on the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every act created by a secret service (a nation of x any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper extracts.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw nothing further than what you were able to read over months in any x-every journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifying caricatured profile of Gaddafis offered Stoff for their time labarrett artists.
The rule, according to which the secret files can consist only of already known news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and that is not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Gral, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rose Cruisers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (now because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Likewise, the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the Secret Service (unless he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), which is considered only true to what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, sent by the American embassy in Rome to the State Department, was the same as those that Newsweek had published before the week.
So why was such a revocation for the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every trained person already knows, even though the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then government leaders can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation tasks, have been in spioning centers.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very carefully, and it is not from shamelessness that you do so to ignore it.
However, the fact to repeat it publicly infringes the task of holiness and serves to put American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-every hacker can see the secrets of the most powerful country in the world provides a significant strike against the Prestige of the State Desert.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "scarffriends" in distress.
But let’s devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Earlier, in Orwell’s time, you could assemble all the power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subordinates.
Orwell’s prophecy would have been able to prove perfectly correct where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction performed, the hotel visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you take a look at what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as the robbers of the citizen - can explore the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret as it gives the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it means to reveal the secrets of Hill.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury that has been added to such a huge power?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will not provide any other reserved information online - that would be the same as one of the road corners.
But it’s also obvious that it’s forgotten with the current technologies to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can in the future private and only for certain ears be discussed certain relationships?
I know very well that my prediction sounds at the moment according to science fiction and romance, but I see it necessary to imagine the government agents, in a secret way emotionally moving on uncontrollable march routes, their messages are nowhere else but in mere memory, and besides, the few of them have written information.
The information would be stored in a single copy of closed sheets: Watergate’s spy attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that today technology advances like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the communication, the Internet rebuilds a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogical) video caches had enabled the researchers to explore a film band for band by flying from rear to rear and all the secrets of the assembly, while today the (numerical) CDs allowed nothing else than jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
With high-speed trains you will travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane including the departure.
It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communications technology return to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what secrets were scattered between the messages.
Currently there are the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Believes its Financial Promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate the compliance of the rapidly resolved funding promises (also called Fast Start or Early Funding), which have been implemented by developing countries.
And the grooves of French beauty talks have already been discovered.
The Copenhagen Treaty has committed developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast start-up financing: detailed report of their Member States, press conference, major additional events, brochure distribution.
The operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its actual value: developing countries and civil society like to see it if all developed countries have the same precision level.
The EU announced that it would have released €2.2 billion in 2010, bringing the right way to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a bit more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" in accordance with the Copenhagen Treaty to ensure that additional investment has been made without the disadvantage of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the value he considers the best.
For example, the EU Commission has outlined itself as a guideline for those of 2009: international funding will be maintained and will provide 150 million in the framework of Fast-Start funding for over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar reference values, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France believed that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 would be "new and additional".
In other words, there are no direct values for the expenditure of the previous year or global public development aid.
Concretely, the overall sum of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or also reduce weight) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the distribution of grants and loans.
There is no rule yet, and each one chooses his own calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are €1 borrowed as equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is only difficult to understand: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often related to emission deduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is false to present the euro which is taken as an equivalent to a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the investment country should be more.
But France has nothing else in the sense of the following: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donating) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that largely uses loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) comply with their commitments to 100% grants.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France just once gives 10 cents and understands a similar contribution.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast start-up financing with a double swing: one part with a further development of the action over time and the other part with the reality of financial engagement.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to have been Bercy who conducted the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (which is why the other Member States continue to borrow if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since developing countries aren't able to completely deceive...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question of relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on climate.
But it could be too much in the immense machinery of UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn his lesson from early financing this year.
First of all, France could announce a change in its type of consignment for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equitable justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, however, France could lead to discussions on the object of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed topic): there is no question of the "accessibility" or the type of lending of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as advanced with regard to disputes as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new environmental minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on the Fast-Start of France and its vision of "requiredness" as well as the use of loans would increase from nature from the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticidals taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes over the day 81 different chemicals, a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Genérations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "report not statistically significant value in the view of the small number of analysed samples, but represent the illustration character of the treated problem," had usually purchased foods consumed within four, about ten-year-old children to the meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruits and fruits, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day – were also studied as well as sets of laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The volume balance is low: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as possibly or possibly cancerous and five classified as safe carcinogen, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for any chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the nearby generality of the cases, it is very clear that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancerous substances or substances with endocrine disorder factor is excited."
Already at breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain already more than ten of the possibly cancerous residues and three safely identified as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil as an intermediate meal for the study shows traces of six chemicals, including a forbidden fungicide in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tune fish from the bush, even the baguette and the cougume of pesticides and other chemicals were smashed.
In the conductive water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the lash steak with 34 detected chemical residues was most "rich", and even the plastic counter used in the microwave was not unloaded.
The resulting risk of this pollutant cocktail for consumers is likely to be underestimated, according to the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) on its own proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "advancement of civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, including 76 in grain.
