A 28-year-old kitchen teacher was found dead in San Francisco’s shopping mall
A 28-year-old couch in San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping mall this week.
But the brother of the victim says that he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and he says: “His affairs have finally gone well.”
The room, found at Westfield Mall, was identified as a 28-year-old Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Death Judge Agency.
The San Francisco Police Department said death was identified as a mental illness and the investigation was underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a train coach in Boston, had received his dream job as a train coach of San Francisco's restaurant Sons & Daughters six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said they were "ashamed and shocked" because of his death.
“We have a small team that works like a close family, and it’s going to be very missed,” the representative said.
We will send our thoughts and sorrows to Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank stayed at the start of the hostels, but recently "her affairs finally went well".
"She found an apartment and met a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a great heart.
His way to feel cohesion with the family was to make us food, to make us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any disputes.
He was a brother who walked along the river.
"In a world where so many things are in trouble, it was a dirty diamond that shine brighter every day," he said.
All who have information about this will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Office's point number 415-575-4444.
Doctors will stop: Requirements for new workfighting measures
Representatives of medical professionals have requested their trade unions to adopt new combat measures in their disputes with regard to the new agreement.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) calls on the entire Council to support new workfighting measures since September.
The JDC says that the ministers have failed to take care of the agreement.
In July, doctors and doctors voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58 percent of the voted members rejected it.
In a letter published on Twitter on Thursday, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "slim" on issues that led to the rejecting of the agreement.
"In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the fully proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC government has today filed a formal request for the special meeting of the BMA Council to obtain authorisation for the progressive and expanding workfighting programme, which begins early September.
The dispute has been observed that doctors have participated in six lashes this year, including the first complete labour position in the history of the NHS healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, BMA’s doctoral coach manager, has differed from the terms recommended by BMA after the vote had been rejected to the agreement.
He had told the members of the BMA at the meeting before the vote of 55,000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the deal would be prescribed to the doctors of England.
Russia and Turkey: external association?
The one who ended in the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to meet each other and declare that the fight against eight-month words and economic sanctions has officially expired.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden palace of Peter’s Palace, I received a clear impression that this agreement would be desired more in Ankara.
Yes, at the opportunity, they were arrested.
But Putin’s smile seemed popular, and he hardly threatened the heat, even according to his own distorted standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, continued to talk about Putin's "loving friend" - five times, according to one report.
I confused the bills.
He also swears that relations with Russia would return not only to the level before the crisis, but even to a better level.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan’s behaviour as if no evil had ever happened.
I think his passion is quite opposite.
But a viley that radiates against Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down the Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow was angry at that time.
Putin accused Ankara of shaking Moscow on the back.
It was even worse when it became an unexpected friend.
Rebuilding real confidence will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russia’s opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-governmental media has led to an impressive, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were blameless to everything.
The most stable were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade from the Syrian regions of ISIS.
He has severely forbidden this.
But the official message in Peter was that it was time to move forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
The advantages of the arrangement for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdogan will need all his friends after he was almost removed from power in a failed conquest last month.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also been clear to him.
There is also a financial motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been severe, particularly ban on ordering flights that usually carry several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
The amount has decreased by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, local travel agents and booking airlines will certainly be eased when flights continue.
They want to take the late season to the Mediterranean.
And this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since imports of agricultural products from Turkey are allowed again.
"Turisties there, tomatoes back here," as was formed in the report of Vedemosti.
But the visit also had a political added value to Moscow.
In Ankara, we are angry with the wests of what is considered to be a weak response to the attempted overthrow.
With a long-lasting increase in progressing EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is excited to take advantage of coldness and worrying about Turkey's links to the west countries, will appear.
Russia’s leader certainly received dismissals from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary company to support the nominated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival to Moscow, who is deeply rooted in his fear of the change of power.
Thus, this meeting in the Pramean coastal camps enabled the Russian and Turkey's "external union", as one analyst described me: two countries who experienced them rejecting them and treating them wrongly, combined their forces.
However, these two have great disputes despite public conciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed to the role of peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot to say that after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even been discussed.
Turkey’s President was aware of the answer to the question regarding their disputes, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear understanding of where they can seek a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster by a NATO member of Turkey shooting down a Russian fighting machine, it is certainly better that two leaders are still in speech fields.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland customers
According to the Bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is undermined by the back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is missing from outside Scotland customers.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand joined the bank’s international goals.
After the bank almost broke eight years ago and it had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
The bank’s strategies have used the ‘RBS’ brand at this time to protect other consumer funding brands.
It was supported by millions of weights used for international sports sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come in front of the industry.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it is not restarted from the start.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, except for the head office and the securities lists, will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed on the tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand becomes our investor brand and the employer of our employees because we now become a much more brand bank.”
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue the Six Nations sponsorship, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s now time to move to the brand’s bank, because basically (we’re questioning) it’s about how we can focus on making this better bank for our customers,” said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very dark if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with its work, what we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000
The detector shuts the shampoo after a double victory, he has a total of 3,000 wins
Frankie Dettori has secured his 3,000th British record in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved his second victory at his home race by training John Gosden with the Predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is a sixth jockey who reaches this turmoil in the competition.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Edder, and Willie Carsonia.
The three-time masterjockey Dettor, who won earlier at Ghayyari, said, "This is special."
I am very sensitive because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It’s not a big event, it’s not a Royal Ascot, it’s a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm easy and very humble.
The detector absorbs hurricanes when he is tolerating Predilection after the victory.
Two competitors have achieved this rivalry in the championship competitions - Richard Johnson and a 20-time master Sir Anthony McCoy, who had records in breaching his career of over 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best parasites of today’s time, and it’s not surprising that she has achieved this rainbow that only a few have achieved before her.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactic suddenly separates him from the other weighting room.
He is a great ambassador to competitions, his tone and charisma have attracted fans of the species for years.
I told Frank a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ride with 6,000 winner if he hadn't just been a weekend and big cats jockey!
Frankie has been riding most of the winner in the UK for 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a living person who is a good thing for the British competition, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated a landing seat from a trademark formed.
Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British race strike for two decades.
This has been a mountain road.
In 1996, he won wins in big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win in Ascot, but he also suffered from an aircraft crash and suffered from a drug ban.
Three years ago, he was hard to return after six months of ban, but he showed significant characteristics when he challenged the suspects and returned to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - the Detector has previously said he would like to continue competing for at least 50 years of age.
Russia’s Chief Executive Officer Sergei Ivanov
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has suddenly distinguished Chief Executive Officer Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted interior circle for many years.
The 63-year-old is now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said Putin had "ordered Ivanov to move away from the roles of the Russian presidential administration", but there was no reason for this.
Ivanovi Vice-Manager Anton Vaino has been appointed as his successor since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he led the President's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
When he was named, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your actions as the Head of State as regards the draft laws and the management of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Vaino be named for him.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a move that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, operated the Soviet security service in the KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin on television, both men argued that the Chief Executive Officer was withdrawn from his own request.
But despite the smile on cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
Is this just a trace of some kind of power fighting?
No one knows yet.
But the official allegation that the man, once declared a potential president, would suddenly lead Russia's environmental policy, was truly dubious.
In his comments on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that in the early 2012 debate I asked you to give my responsibility for four years this very complex, even to say a job, task.
Well, now I've been the head of the board for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the task in December 2011.
He previously served as Defence Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the state security service at KGB as well as Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the state security service at the FSB, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy head.
When Putin rose to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanovsky could become Russian President Putin after the second season, since the third season had been against the Constitution.
However, this task went to Putin's second close allied, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson gets a knife when a producer hits
Gibson was part of a physical dispute in the last month at Los Angeles.
The series producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced their separation in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner Gibson apologized on Thursday before his release was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
“I think it happened,” he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, the details of how Gibson’s character is removed from the series reported by the FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old who had previously marked the Dharma & Greg case comedy has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it all for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement.
I had been hoping to be there until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible working team and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the twelfth production season of the series was formulated on 28 September.
Mysteries end in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be the windfish that has left in the water cycle afterwards.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published a film film in Periscope in the hope that someone could bring an explanation for the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now expanding Fifeen
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have combined Queensferry’s northern overseas as well as the countryside, which means that the bridge now extends to Fifeen.
It is the first of the four bulbs between the "cancer lines" that are now preparing the bridge around each of the three pillars.
The bridge of Fifesta is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 shirts.
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be ready by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to walk on the bridge.
He said, “This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry’s overseas.
We have proven all the truly impressive engineering work in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge.”
Despite the enormous amount and weight of the bridge, the finishing of the soil between the ground and the bridge is a mandatory operation in which the extremely accurate measurements should be consistent.
Overall, nearly 79% of the bridge is now in place, and today your last portion of the bridge is laid down in Rosyth, which means that the whole bridge is ready to rise to its bridge.
Michael Martin, head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure of any bridge project is always a significant storm.
In this fantastic project, this closing represents the top of the construction technology.
After the last portion of the dish was installed and combined with the expanding northern dish, we then had to close the remainder of the dish from the north, i.e. from the inland direction.
This was done by drawing the land bridge of the north-east 700 mm southward.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding action.
Great, since the land is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and should be drawn to about 3% of the angle of calmness.
Required because the permitted measurement ranges according to which the team worked were small, only a few millimeters in both directions.
Fortunately, however, everything went well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happily living"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell on their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station made a warning on Friday at 13.20 (BST) after the crew saw the event evolving on the Moelfre Bay Bay Bay.
Three men tried desperately to swim for their boats as they continued to move on to themselves.
"We saw the boat turning closer to men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, a rescue boat driver.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had washed it out of them until we reached the move," he added.
The local fishing ship rescued two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found as a robber in a kid falling off without a rescue ship.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue gate and brought back to the rescue station.
Jones said, “These three men in the water are happy to be alive and completely harmless.
In the boat's engine there was a kidnapping, but it was somehow shattered the boat from the time of the person when the boat fell.
Someone cares about these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It’s amazing to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been worried that teens and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people rise up in the sofa and participate in something.
The display time was initially limited to TV, then to video games, and now to smartphones recently.
It is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the wildlife called Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s video games (more of them were drawing series, gaming cards and other further products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat spread before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was delayed, as a huge popularity overloaded servers.
Only days ago, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the box, players use their smartphones in search of Pokémons tracked via GPS, which can be "photo" or "stop" after finding it (with the phone's box capture).
The generation that played the game as younger has joined the wildlife and jumped up the sofa according to research.
In the U.S., the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "median person".
The Apple Watch Cardiogram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent in Cardiogram's followers.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees training level data.
The invitations of many public health campaigns to "beat 30", "beat sofa" and "be active every day" haven't produced any result because most public health ads are boring and careful of people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of the movement cannot be limited.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight loss, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The great Pokémon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, riding the air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even get to hunt new friends.
As usual, bad fans are looking for things to complain about.
Yeah, somebody can walk through the door.
And what about it?
There's been a breakdown.
Although previously there were applications like Fitbit that could be monitored, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
Newspaper disappears and uses grown up in time.
However, because of Pokémon’s success, other games that combine apps and virtual reality with the real world’s activity will help many hunters become more active, better conditioned and healthier.

Simone Biles hit gold in women's reinforcement
Forget the pressures.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all of them.
Energy jumps.
Smoke with woods.
Unbelievable permanence.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic player.
The 19-year-old U.S. amplifier achieved the championship on Thursday, leaving himself and the end of the world to the Olympic Lights.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver metalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian pro-symisticist Aliya Mustafinan.
Simone Biles in the U.S. balanced women's mass performance at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The Biles became the fourth American woman who gradually won the championship of the multiplication, and in general the fifth American champion, while strengthening her generation, and perhaps the best of all times.
He broke out in the tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises his class with the best athletes of other generations, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has managed its species for the last three years by winning 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, programs with a mix of ambition and accuracy so surprising that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best I can see to be a stronger".
The last trial waited in Brazil, a competition that wasn't so between Biles and other competitors, but between his and his greatest expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a big gold cattle would have been disappointed.
Simone Biles, on the left of the United States, and Aly Raisman, won the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the final of the women's multi-individual competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he acted as a top member of the national team coordinator, Martha Karolyin, at the departure party.
Although Biles argued that he has never thought of the future as he walks to the top of a long knowledge, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permantion program - of which his brand's voltium construction - has been adapted to Latin American music, which was also suitable for the street next to the Rion Olympics.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a background, and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother, when she was on the study hall where Boorman was trained, has become a forcer.
He hasn't lost the multiplication since the summer of 2013, and this winning pipe will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was a small lead after two rounds, it was just a shame.
The balance and permanence, in which Biles is a ruling world champion, waited.
He climbed at the top of 15,433 points and overcame them by gaining 15,933 permanence.
Raisman blessed him with charity when they waited for the final points - only formality - and the tears rose up in the eyes of Biles with the glittered, white and blue, when the hague from which he once wrote his book became true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of revolt after four years when he was divided on a third position, but lost the prons in the renewal of Montenegro.
This time, a 22-year-old head of the team, which Americans call "issue", was clearly headed.
He sent flight troops to the public after his permanence in the sensual threat of return, which sometimes seemed to be the questionnaire.
With regard to Bilesi, this 19-year-old twittered earlier this week gets a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder shot in their listening to music in the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
The officials said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on 12 June.
Knowing, it is told that a shooter standing on the side of the passenger would shoot up to eight times in his hand and then escape the second car.
According to the police, the thief did not seem to be the result of the thief, because the attacker did not carry his handbags or another adult victim of $29,00.
Phoenix police representative, Lieutenant Lieutenant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting led researchers to check whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have died and two injured in nine attacks in the last four months, mostly in the Latin American city.
"This is happening in the residential area in front of the house," Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several cars, such as the brown Nissan, the black BMW, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related to each other and are committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was injured in a hospital where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellish's daughter, Malea, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that they were often sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The officials also published a police statement, which took place just half an hour before the trip, and was subject to an open-package car, which was also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The researchers found refugees from the seat, from the seat, and from the seat of the seat in the engine mode.
6-year-old mother who is sick of microkephalia: "Your country is ease"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But, unlike most of his agemates, Edmund is a minor, a result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first idea was that I couldn’t do this.
I can't do this.
I haven't promised that.
What isn't true - I really promised it," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to identify them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he should be placed in institutional care.
"My first action was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks on foot.
Edmund didn't sit or crash until he was only three years old, and he didn't talk yet.
But he slowly reaches some rainbows.
He walks as assisted and rides a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows how Edmund's inventions refer to "you sing to me."
“We’ll learn from him from the language of the news,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common reference language - he tells Edmund has invented some of his own references.
Microkephalus can be due to a number of different reasons: genetics, such as Edmund’s case, or pregnancy virus infections, such as cough or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary significantly.
It's too early to say how it affects the lives of Zika contaminated.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden caused by the uncertain future.
I just wondered what would happen.
What's going on?
And he doesn't really know yet.
In fact, I haven't asked for the prediction for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really give me that.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers whose babies are born because of Zika.
The situation makes it easier.
You can believe that the situation will make it easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Rainfall and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi Louisiana
The floods of rainfall and widespread floods in Louisiana were made by the governor to declare the emergency on Friday, and the state was expected to rain on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in Southeast Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flood over their wings and caused a wide flood due to extreme rainfall.
Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are constantly connected with local authorities, and that assistance is already coming to the districts that need it.
Representative of the Governor's Office for Security and Emergency Preparation, Mike Steele said they would receive requests for water rising vehicles, boats and sands.
Steele said that the Tangipahoan district alone asked for tens of thousands of sandpieces.
The flood is in effect until Saturday, most of the southern Louisiana.
The weather service said that the area is expected to rain from three to five cents more.
In South Alabama, the flood was valid on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rougen and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flood top record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood into several houses near Baton Rougen.
He also said that as a threat, the flood of the Ascension District on the shore of the river, when the floods slowly descend to Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River flowing south of the state of Mississippi in Liverpool was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning at nine.
The rescuers are still killing people from the flood waters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and boyfriend were close to Glosteria on Friday.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek, which is usually over 400 feet away from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another, nearby boy, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water continued to rise," Hansford said.
It extended to my belt.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she hadn’t seen the water of a bowl so high over the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said he and his family have all the injuries, and he's the only swimmer.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued the three in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods are "speaking rapidly to the broad" during the continuation of the hard drives, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one eyewitness near Livingston reports 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday night.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely tired of the hardship since Wednesday.
The flood of races and streets led to the rescue of residents of the Tangipaho County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school circles, the authorities said.
CBS’s subsidiary WWL reports that a member of the City Council in Tangipaho said 200 homes were left under the flood.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, but both are now under the flood.
The President of the District, Robby Miller, said that the authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had remained in the rising islands.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, protectors have been opened to those evacuated.
"They'll get back home when the water starts to drop," he said.
In the county of Tangipahoa, Hammond, a couple of streets were closed because of rising water, and the inhabitants were allowed to take sandstones to try to keep the water away from their homes and moves.
“The last major flood here was in March,” city administration Lacy Landrum said.
It's going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that the flat rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, a large house was reported to have been flooded, but until Friday no flooding has been reported.
Shopper Value Foods, CEO of Amittas, Keith Townson has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues to rise."
"That's the Fire" was a six-year-old Mahaj Brown who survived Philadelphia's shooting
The police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, meaning another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown got several shooting wounds, including his neck, his leg, his arm and his stomach, but he was aware of him when he was moved to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little neck was full of treasures," his son's grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the condition of the boy has been critical, and several surgery has been carried out to him.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting first-class at a local sub-school.
Brown was one of four people shot at Germantown's card.
Three men were shot: two of 29 years old and one of 32 years old.
One 29-year-old men were reported to be in a critical state; two other victims were in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the car's front bank together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police investigated whether any of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers told CBS Philadelphia that it seemed that there was a crossroads between several shooters.
The types of denial of the attack, which originated from various attacks, filled the place of the event.
It seems that it was definitely a continuous battle.
The street was rejected on both sides of the foot.
"There seemed to be a number of armed fighters here, and they were in an active battle," Philadelphian police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and cars in the area were also available.
The arrests have not been carried out and the information received says the police are investigating the tracks of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, got her hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighbourhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
So I call the Women's Olympic Force Team this year for more than one reason.
First, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so ruling.
And second: This team includes three artists, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team, finally, looks from America.
It has also established the top of the accompanying of the dark and Latin American women species.
The most successful feminist in the last four years has been an Afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
That's great.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised as an Olympic fan, and America hurried.
Now the world has been able to prove the incredible performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected, but mastery power programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American woman who gradually won individual gold in women's multiplication.
And Aly Raisman's team got silver.
We see the peak of the species, but the situation does not appear to be in this power plants across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five), because in the next Olympic power team there will be only four power players, and this is Marta Karol's last year coach.
However, the reality is that reinforcement is expensive, and reinforcements are generally practiced in private reinforcement clubs that are maintained by parents who pay training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers and their reinforcements, as well as their families) and a further list of guarantees.
A large number of these power clubs are located in the treasures of pre-city rural areas that can support species.
These clubs will receive all their training, and this is a costly and long-term commitment to the families of strengtheners.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles’ coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez’ coach, have both coached their athletes since they started the exercise.
We need to bring more affordable and available power training training to communities where many young girls are inspired by Simon, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my power foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and cheap strengthening in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin) and have trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high levels of strengthening for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this significant Olympic species.
Strengths develop the body’s strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as the hardness of the mind, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, as well as school and workout.
This team’s inspiration gets thousands of young girls to start the reinforcement, and it’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing seriously taking the "girl power" by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls coming from different backgrounds starting on the way towards a healthy, strong and successful young womanship.
Doctors have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal to organize new lawsuits
The Ministers had hoped to cease the amendment by agreeing to the improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 votes attended by a doctor rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that NHS was "unknown soil", and that little extra delays hurt staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee for Doctoral Practitioners at BMA, said last night: "Doctoral practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it accelerates the existing workforce crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
When the first group of doctors is transferred to the new agreement for only eight weeks, progress must be taken and the time is over.
BMA’s businesses to resolve disputes through negotiations have faced the government’s unwillingness to participate and from time to time deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his doors are always open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, remove punishments and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he does not, doctors are ready to continue the fighting.
In the end of April, the latter was delayed by nearly 13,000 routine accidents and 100,000 recipients, when nurses and consulting doctors were painted to act in place of doctors in the latter care.
The Ministers had hoped to cease the changes to me by agreeing to the improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekly salary with 55,000 medical professionals subject to the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers Association, appealed to doctors so that they wouldn’t stop.
Mortimer said, "The struggles are achieved very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause anxiety, anxiety and disturbance to patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision (Guard Role) and the phenomena (Whistleblowing).
Employees were hoping that a continuous positive discussion on other important topics - such as development, flexibility of training, extra training returns from summer holidays, cost of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, learning freedom, and the gender-salary organization in the field of health and health in the field of medicine - is a sign of how serious work is being done in the field of education.
A drug paying two pounds per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds per day from the liver medicine after the authorities have recommended that it be given longer to people.
The drug that prevents blood clotting, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurring events in people with heart disease.
The medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another stage.
NHS’s supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to calculate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now, NHS’s supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to calculate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them get a second stage or stroke.
Heart attacks and stroke are caused by a fat that is accumulated in the wall of the valve, which forms athamium.
If a stroke breaks down, it can cause blood clotting, which prevents blood circulation by causing a heart attack.
If the stroke disappears, it can pass through the blood and break the blood circulation into the brain, causing a stroke.
Individuals who have already received one stage have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by a British company AstraZeneca, which is sold under the name Brilique, reduces this risk by making an injury less likely.
In the today published NICE guideline, it is recommended that humans take 90 mg of ticagrelore for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective treatments for prevention of advances, up to a quarter of people who suffer from a heart attack will later receive a second heart attack or stroke, whose consequences are often devastating.”
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective to calculate the risk of later heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagreloria, we are pleased to add available treatment options to a number of thousands of people who are potentially beneficial.
Since data on efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited for more than three years, the recommendation is not recommended for treatment for longer than this period.
Culture of Political Correctness allows elections to bloom in Muslim regions
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was officially removed last year due to corruption, giving rise to the government report.
The culture of political correction has led to the fact that a widespread vote in Muslim communities has been taken into account, is disclosed in the shocking government report today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles imposed police, electorates, and city delegations that they have left the evidence of the "religious oversensitivity" to the election.
The former Community secretary, the current Emperor of anti-corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should allow the possibility to put guards outside the votes to protect the feared voters.
He recommends voters to submit their identity certificate when voting to prove who they are.
Nowadays, voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even suggests that the finger of the voter should be assembled with an inseparable black so that no one can vote twice.
The reporters should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
It requires broader access to the press to the documents and decisions of the Authority made by the informal committees or the working group.
“This would not only protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with the vow,” he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlet's vote scandal.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from the office as a result of numerous accusations of corruption and illegal acts.
The Court of Justice found Rahman "discriminately" the religious feelings of his Muslim community, as well as the silence of his appreciation by accusations of racism and Islamism.
Rahman is said to be "leading his election campaign on the basis of the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote on him."
Up to 300 votes were calculating or resulting from the fact that the person votes as something else appears.
Sir Eric said there was a fake evidence across the country.
He expressed his particular concern in voting on the vote of a voter in which members of a high-value Muslim community were told that people were stressed to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on the cleansing of the voting system, including the proof of identity with an identity certificate
In his report, "the evidence was presented that some vulnerable members of the communities of ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, were pushed to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in those communities with the background of Pakistan or Bangladesh.
"It was worried that... state institutions had left the attention of such behavior 'politically correct' due to oversensitivity related to race and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals for the cleansing of the system, including the ban on political activists dealing with the voting flags in order to stop the "voting collection".
The report reviewed by Theresa May also requires stricter amendments to registers to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation frauds.
Check options to prove voters' identity before voting.
Use the unleavened black to the finger of a person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Provide systematic national audits to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for your requests on the automatic post vote.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-made voices and letters through the post, where voices are sent.
Let the police put guards around the votes.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of fear under Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make the photo unlawful in the votes.
It is required that the votes are used only in English (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff holds the rule that the voter must go to the door alone.
Sir Eric is telling the Greater London police forces that it's "astonishing" that no crime was raised after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court remained as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegal corruption by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty on the basis of numerous grounds without doubt, according to a criminal exhibit.
He also criticized the inefficient "slow-field audits" in the city delegations voting registration agencies.
Sir Eric said, “The last year’s judgment on the Tower Hamlets was awakening.
Our nationality has a wonderful legacy as a parliamentary native, but this alarming and secretly profoundness of the elections and the prohibition of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy Katen bicycle hunters to the island and other famous events in the Rion Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rion 2016 Olympics have gone to the mixture of the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, proven to be the impressive duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic player is certainly not the only athlete fighting gold this summer, who can concentrate on his own famous double race, at least on social media.
So, in honor of Rio’s games and all of the famous faces that are currently on our squares, FEMAIL has made up a list of the Olympic athletes that look clear to Hollywood’s celebrities.
Hunter and chicken: Brady Ellisonia, a member of the U.S. men's band, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Katen’s double collection on the bicycle, many people online have been quick to see how one of the specific rifles could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio double.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's rainbow team, has caused a storm on Twitter since he climbed on his surface to his pictures, in which he looks terrifying like The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the thrill of social media, the shooter admitted that since he was a child, he had heard his appearance from Leol.
“I don’t see a great equality, except perhaps in relation to the coast,” Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good guy, so I think this is kindness."
One of the most popular comparisons from London since 2012 will certainly also appear this year: the disturbing likelihood of Britain's long-term striker Greg Rutherford and popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian singer Alya Mustafina, the greatest, apparently eye-catched, has been said to be Cuban singer Gloria Estefan’s double series.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrisoni for years.
Bigger eye exchange: This user believes Nathan is a "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have similar strong corner ears and lips.
Russian silver metalist Yulia Efimova has more than the same actress Annalynne McCord as a brown skin and a colorful skin, while the U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of the "Joseph Gordon Levit's sports version".
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter player Jennifer Carpenter, right, share similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased to see similarities as well.
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the pair of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed their happiness on the site that “some others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular references include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with Laura Linney's smile, as well as the golden poet Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful, wide smile exact to the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union smile.
CBC's Olympic Commander apologizes after Chinese swimmers say "dead like pigs"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth post on women’s 4x200-meter free movement on Wednesday enraged CBC’s live Olympic embassy viewers.
Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its detectives said during the kidnapping of the 14-year-old Chinese woman's "disappeared as the smell of evil" and "dead as a pig".
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was disabled when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-meter free spin message final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC’s explanatory teams to bring “colors,” was heard saying, “Bring a 14-year-old girl from China to your home, baby.
Too excited, lost like a bad smell, died like pig.
Thank you for it."
The Chinese speaker Ai Yanhan, 14, swims the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to capture China.
Watchers around Canada quickly react online after shocked using the language and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did CBC's explainer just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'has died like pig'?"
The idiot didn’t realize he was still in direct mission.”
China Ai Yanhania was described in the 4 x 200 meters free tournament message final as follows: "Bring a 14-year-old girl from China to your home, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was spectacular and fast, in many interviews with him.
Twitter users didn’t stop listening to how unpleasant Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada, and you'll make us all sound racist.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who broke out the CBC mission, excuseed MacDonald’s comment on the mission, saying: “We’re sorry that the comment on the swimsuit had been made to the mission.
"It was an apology, we're sorry that this happened."
The CBC ended up apologizing for more than 90 times people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russel had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and linked an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The TV company also promptly apologized and published an opinion.
We're deeply sorry that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Yesterday, we quickly took action and apologized to our viewers and followers on social media on the direct mission.
For clarity, it is necessary to say that Byron's comments were associated with swimming performance, not with him as a person.
However, it was an inadequate and regrettable choice, and Byron is very sorry for his message.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized for a direct mission and tried to define his note by noting that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comments I made yesterday after women's message," he said at the CBC Olympics.
"I was referring to the swimsuit, not to him as a person."
"It seems unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it unrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primarki client for a woman who has been ashamed to deal with underwear in the middle of trade
Customers didn’t know what to look at when a woman crashed in the middle of Primark’s movement to try underwear.
The things did not improve the fact that after estimating how she looked in the pants, a woman pulled them out of her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued the tour and finally arranged four pairs of shopping malls at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkeston.
Primary business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkeston, where a woman arranged the shoes and then put them back to the resignation
At the same time, the mother of two children in the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after trying the underwear, a mysterious woman “was dressed again and walked away from the movement without buying anything.”
He said, "People did not believe in their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the trade floor, took the underwear of the pair, broke her own shoes and underwear, and put on her fitted legs.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood in it shameless."
"Everyone watched while she broke off the boots, and obviously didn't like them, because she put them back on the hill."
He did the same for three more couples before he finally decided he didn’t like anything to see, dressed up again and went out.
"She didn't seem to care who looked at or thought about a person who would end up buying the submarines he agreed."
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent, said: "It is a disgrace to think that someone brings to his home the underwears that someone else has tried but not cleansed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, “I realized that the staff obviously tried to remove clothes from the woman’s sale, which is quite good.”
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwears and see that another woman has dressed them on and cut them off, and they haven't washed them."
The Prime Minister said, "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from the sale."
This allows you to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Magaa
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it slightly safer for you.
We talked with Krav Maga, Mayor of the New York Federation, Rhon Mizrachin, to find out how to deal with stealing robbers at a distance.
If you were then posted in front or back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker at the same rate.
According to Mizrach, if you are approaching the back, you must first turn to see your attacker and the "linear fire line".
Then press the gun between the tear edge and the shoulder before you hit the attacker on the face in your free tear circle.
Continue to strike on the knees, and when the attacker goes from the pain to the chicken, turn the gun from his hands, strike him with the gun behind his face, and turn back with the gun toward him.
If the armed person approaches, the technology is similar: remove your body from the fire line, pick up the gun and turn it around so that the criminal can’t jump.
At the same time put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun from his arms, turn back and show him with the gun.
Sounds tough?
Take a look at the video how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grandmaster of Krav Maga, the safest way to get rid of the stealing situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright sets out the most dirty places in Europe for travel
The British dealer has put a serious challenge to his immune system and oxygenation reflection by knocking some of the most dirty and nightmares in Europe.
The writer and travel writer Ian Wright, 51-year-old, would take the euro banknote, the Piccadilly Circ, the train’s waterproof button, and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before he took every item, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he had been in.
However, the experiment, which was made in a film called "Internal Power", resulted in surprising results.
The idea of stopping a railroad button used by thousands of people may seem totally contradictory, but in fact, in the kitchen store there are more bad bacteria.
On his journey through Europe, Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing of his necklace left him another evil taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for his intestinal sustainability testing when traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task from public railway stations to the wc seat drilling button has actually tested its immune system.
In the film, he said, "I have been quite careful about my health since I was a child, and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth from meat, mosquitoes, and damn water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the polluted Russian public toilet.
At his exhibit, there were more than 4,000 units in photometers.
For comparison, the hand reading of the counterfeitures should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public visit, he did not agree to crash when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the opposition hands was less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist's film, Indoor Power trail, together with the Finnish makeup, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the voice said, "This is almost the worst thing I've smelled at the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to do anything because there's a nightmare here.
The traces of the inner power were produced together with the Finnish meyer, Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilusta, which contains milk acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Choice Director of Fires, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, which at the same time would explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we got into the idea "Let's get married to Ian."
They argue that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking about products, we would like to put them into a greater context: tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our archaeological environment, the significance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the intestine is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can tell more to consumers in an interesting way.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The director of the document, Tom Hakala, added: "Let's say that, even if Ian had been kicking some of the things I asked him, like a nightmare Russian visitor showing in the film, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the nudging things were easier for Ian, while some of them were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty bowls saved."
In the 2015 survey, 84 percent of respondents combined milk acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said they used at least amongst the products to which milk acid bacteria were added.
The nightlife family destroyed the rental camp in Cornwall Saltashi before the wedding
The nightlife family caused 50,000 pounds of damage to the rental house after they were deported due to neighbours' terrorism.
Tanya Keldon and his partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltashi after they had been complained several times.
When they were most powerfully removed from the property, the shocked employees of the apartment company found that the property was in bad condition.
In the sheen were fired holes, the floor floors were covered, the waste was spread to the floor, and the walls were torn with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private property.
Conna McEvoy, host of Cornwall Housing, said he feared that the real estate could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real shame for people, and I don't think people should live in this way.
There are many things to consider here because this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is bad, and their name is bad.”
The couple had three sons living in the real estate, and according to the police, the horror of the family had to include a street apple on the baking holidays, fears of neighbors, drug use, and luxurious scream, disputes and curses.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, named in the rental contract, received a decision on the non-social behaviour in June.
Many of the rooms in the house under the shelves were found an old waste.
The property from which the hands had previously been transferred to drugs, the floor floors had been scattered up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting in the street, and that the police were regularly called to the place.
Cornwall Housing married the most powerful woman and this partner’s property this week after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks, the time to change voluntarily.
Reliefed neighbours thanked the wedding saying that their lives had become a hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived in their neighbourhood for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"We didn't dream this morning.
We got up because there was so quiet here - we haven't noticed it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, CEO of Cornwall Housing Neighborhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police are often invited to the property.
Roskia and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental camp.
He added: “It’s sorry that the resident has taken no responsibility for his own and his family’s behaviour, because the wedding is always the last way Cornwall Housing has considered.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme, and their actions certainly scared neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the brave and informed community members have done.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to neighbours and send a message that anti-social use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three sons all lived in the real estate at different times, but they were all in the twenties.
After a wedding, a dirty patch left on the floor of a single bedroom
The company’s employees now need to clean the waste surfaces around the house
In 2014, the police made a ride to the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as waves, accessories and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was charged with fines due to his guilt on the possession of drugs in class (b) in order to divide them in advance.
He argued that the money was intended for his son Lee Skeldon's funeral. This died in a car accident in 2013.
Obviously, Tanya and her partner live homelessly in private property in Plymouth.
For many of the house rooms there was a sharp graffiti.
Police say they're trying to get married people who keep the rules of their rental contract.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said the wedding was a clear warning to other renters who continued to keep the rules in default.
“This is a message for those who think their behavior is without punishment, and for those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour; the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Travellers in Portugal frightened when the military shuttle flew on the beach with low hippo
Solar tourists in Aveiro in Portugal experienced their lives shockingly
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force would have been very low
Air Force said it was a training flight and argued that security was not threatened.
At the moment, the frightened tourists began to get upset when a low-flyed shower washed over the beach.
The dramatic tracking shows how the military aircraft came near to the distance of contact from sandy sands located in northern Portugal’s Aveiro.
The holidaymakers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the metal belonging to the shower, even though they didn’t initially see what the back of the cloud was coming to them.
The incident occurred in the Costa Nova near Aveiron yesterday afternoon.
One of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of a dramatic swelling on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it would fall into the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and really felt like the machine was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the P-3C Orion aircraft’s pilot was on an exercise plane to identify fishing vessels near the coast, and the aircraft had to land so low because it was the only way to check the vessels.
He said that the shower had flyed significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by the smoke of nearby lands, but the air forces convinced that nobody’s safety was at risk.
The earthquakes have destroyed parts of Manner-Portugal this summer, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces said today that the pilot had to fly because of low visibility conditions, smoke caused by earthquakes, and thick smoke,
The aircraft was on an exercise plane, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was requested to identify fishing vessels
Better expected results in the first semester
The South Carolina Social and Health Circle (Eksote) made a better outcome in January - €3.4 million in June.
In the first half of the year, the result was exceeding €4.3 million.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to eliminate institutional care.
The treatment warranty was carried out in all operations.
This year, the exode will shorten the operations.
Exode covers the excess of the previously born deficit.
The remaining percentage may be used to reduce the rivers and buy measures for patients.
The result of the year is expected to be better than €4.6 million.
The Exoten government will discuss the six-month session on Wednesday.
70 Special Borders in Immola swear
70 of the border and marine guards were swearing on Friday.
The military camp of the Border and Marine Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The Tenth Special Border Library Course was organized on the equipment’s sporting facility.
He swore to 70 soldiers.
Special Borders are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and fighting tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were invited to be a Special Border Guard.
They were invited to the selection tests of 250.
Special borders have been trained in Immola since 2007.
At the meeting of the veterans during the reign, five wars were involved in veterans of the border forces.
The medieval age is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the occasion were born in 1918.
Criminal investigation helps in detecting and revealing serious crime - ESS.co.uk
Each of the 11 police stations in Finland has operated in the RTA Criminal Investigation and Analysis Unit since 2014.
The activity of the unit is outwardly invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahd and Hämeenlin are included in the police station.
It's drawn by the Lieutenant Lahtee.
As a captain, the Commissioner is in Lahd.
In addition, the strength of the unit belongs to a civilian enthusiast in Hämeenli.
Everyone works in a civilian office.
The unit has demonstrated its useability and necessity, deputy police chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to other police.
In the meantime, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
The establishment of analytics units is the reform of the newest working methods of police.
The goal was to prevent crimes, i.e., to leave the police more and more rarely calling pills to the place only when they receive an alert.
The data collected and analyzed by the entity will target everyday police activity where it is most necessary.
With the reform of the Police Administration, a Criminal Prosecution Centre was established, with less than three national units and its own Criminal Prosecution Unit for each police agency.
The PTR centre in the context of the central police in Vantaa is conducting operations nationally.
In PTR units, according to their name, the police, customs and border guards are working.
In turn, RTA units work in areas divided by police agencies, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and government units.
The questionnaire extends outside its territory
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour work year, the RTA unit's task is to know what is happening in the area of the entire police agency.
The questionnaire also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, as it also does criminality.
The RTA unit has better atk skills.
The unit seeks to draw attention to new phenomena, productive crimes or crimes that are memorable by registers, alert tasks and observations.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important criminal investigation tools.
Everyone has their own way to act.
Handprint can also be seen at work, whether it is fair or criminal.
Based on the performance of the factor, a particular image is made up of.
Competition can be made either based on a method or on a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The RTA unit’s employees are not going through the city’s necklaces, but their work is not entirely publicly guaranteed.
The use of criminals is not known as its own or its own, as it could lead to the development of their activities by the professionals, which would thus endeavor to prevent the police's criminal investigations.
Police report on the procedures if it predicts that they will be threatened.
For example, such a case had been renewed from the beginning, the method of labelling the empty apartments used in housing murders.
In it, the factors put the apartment in the outer door of the house, a tap, or a rooftop where they tried whether the residents were really on their trips.
The examination material is public for at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most notable is to sign up for a protocol to the court, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found on the site.
The next time the robbers get their hands in their hand.
For this purpose, Vice-Police Chief Tero Sepp Seppes from Hämee police officer, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola from Police of East Finland, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve from Joensu Police Station and Criminal Officer Arto Tuomelaa from Central Police.
Police collect and analyze information to plan practical operations.
Reduction in labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-phase PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
With governmental cooperation, information is collected outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
Daddy-related schoolgirl killed from London in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join the Dad, has died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard of this dead man in Syria's Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in the Russian expression of Raqqaan, which is the base of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, he just died when he planned to escape the war from the country and returned to Britain.
“You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a cemetery and as a testament to others that the departure of the war area involves real risks – that it could make people resign from making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern girls flew to Turkey, from which they went by bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family was told that the girl had married an Isis player in Syria, and that she had become a widow only a few months later.
Reid said Clinton would consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he was elected
The Senate’s Democratic President Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic President Hillary Clinton will appoint judge Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Senate’s Republicans have prevented Garland’s confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mr Mitch McConnell, director of the Senate's majority, says that the next president is electing the person to the status of Antonin Scalia's former Supreme Court.
Reid said on Thursday in a telephone negotiation that he would predict "with a certainty" of Clinton's elected Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he hadn't spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He urged Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "influence the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the head of the United States Court of Appeal in District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who prevented Garland’s appointment are Republican President Donald Trump’s “trailers” and “opportunists”.
He said Trump wouldn’t fit the office.
Treats says the naked calendar is "like women as men"
The Treats Time Magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemeren to publish the 1970’s inspired calendar of Pirell for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they’re going to find their next top-notch 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, chairman of the Treatment, told us earlier this year that his magazine containing a lot of naked pictures differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Obviously, he thinks that the calendar is for them.
"We have to begin to present a timeless and classical discomfort in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures presented by the nude women," Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures via the network or personally at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Destination of vinyl: who actually buys plates?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you go to fill in the commentary with irritated violations, as a writer whose name is not All Single Middle Ages Men, note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of records that have been talked much about is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the innovation of physical objects, but about the medieval momentum.
Obviously, those who have recently purchased a vinyl plate are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, all the most unlikely discs are part of the age group of 18-24 years.
The question is also not only the collection of fans, it includes a symbol: older vinyl purchasers are slightly more likely to feel inside (56 % vs 53 %) and enjoy loneliness (69 % vs 66 %).
But do you think youGov results are true?
If this blog would be a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I was busy in the middle of the hill street in Soho, I'd like to make a grey dress. I'd blame me loudly before I stopped, I'd make a cup of my hands, and I'd say something worthwhile, like, "Let's investigate the thing more accurately."
Let's examine it more in detail.
At the same time, when Soho’s attractiveness and smoothness is slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops and office accessories are now filled with buildings that had previously independent movements - a multitude of amazing specialty plate shops remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I stand very close to a variety of men in some of these stores trying to assess their age and feelings.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (calculator: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (calculator: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably two decades), spends her afternoon due to a meeting in London, and travels shops for a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
“I am,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These discs, which appear in the image above (he sent a sample by email, I didn't follow him home), cover his living room walls.
The reason for obtaining such a huge record and single amount is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy records that he had no reserve for when they were originally published, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and without money.
“Much of the material I bought was late in the 60s and early in the 70s, records published when 11 or 12, records I was probably too young to acquire,” he said.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and more: “I don’t burn or drink too much.
This is my sin."
Wez, a 25-year-old who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of her customers meet meet the profile of YouGov.
However, he has noticed the new waves of people whose enthusiasm has influenced the media. People who have heard that the records have come back to fashion and who have become necessary to buy their old records back.
Based on my discussions, people have generally been freed from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back,” he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl plants in certain ages.
But what about the alleged characteristics of the records?
In a trade like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that disc stores offer a comforting community for similar types.
Wez says that some older customers have been injured especially by the nearby payment system.
Some vinyl fans can crash from the digital world and choose to trust the sustainability of the well-known discs; objects that awaken the teenagers’ lucky memories.
"I think sometimes it may be a matter of filling a hole or some kind of comfort that the property of objects creates," Wez says.
I myself as a collector admit that this is true and I believe it is true to many people.
It is an easy way to fulfill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" said another employee suddenly on the plate.
April’s opinion analysis by ICM revealed that nearly 50% of the people who had purchased a vinyl plate in the previous month hadn’t listened to it yet.
The questionnaire also found that 41 % had a disk player they never use, while 7 % of those purchasing vinyl cells had no disk player.
This section of the news report is likely to look seriously concerned by browsing the pino of the bossa nova collections.
This “award” view of the wake is something that Jonny, a 42-year-old, who works in the Sounds of the Universe, has also noticed.
“Someone came in a while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a recorder, but I want to buy Radiohead’s recorder so that we can put it on the hill,” he said.
This is not a big part, but this is definitely happening.
More products, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a recorder."
Therefore, not elderly, but younger people, late-minded-ages, who are just excited about this.
In the phop, where there is now almost an entire layer reserved for vinyl, there is a much more diverse audience on my arrival.
Seventy-seven couples, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned movements, a fresh synthetic and sexy pop from Wild Beastin, and not an improvisation jazz, it's great to see different customers.
No one of them looks particularly lonely, but it is difficult to show the truth by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppia for a few minutes looking at the various disks available for sale.
He's doing window shops, not spending a lot of money.
He tells me that there's not a lot of trace, so dissipation isn't really an alternative.
"It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is... she gets in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is called the new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I try to look like I'm studying fashion shorts, I found a group of teenage girls gathering for a moment around Polaroid cameras before my father and daughter think about the purchase of Crosley's recorder.
On the left is the wall of Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac discs: a mix of modern music and classics, the essential discs of any medium collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that their touch is impossible.
This is purely the "art vinyls".
But taking into account that little attention gained by these items can mean more money to the industry and send some customers to Soho cancers to request more, there is no much complaint here.
It is not surprising that the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that uses the most luxury, such as vinyl styles.
But even though my findings suggest that YouGo's results are correct at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers in the real world, in the record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They don’t really spend their Thursday mornings malaying Berwick Street’s disc stores around them, browsing the hard disks and avoiding watching a thirty-year-old TV drinker over the middle-aged men’s shoulders.
Holker is the longest living spine animal - video report
Scientists say Holker has a longer lifetime than any other planet on the back of the planet.
The researcher Julius Nielsen says that the recording is on a woman whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and is five meters long.
The French court rejects the application to dismiss trades from the Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request to remove tens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp with thousands of refugees.
In the court proceedings this week, the authorities of Calais argued that the state should be able to eliminate a total of 72 temporary trades, where people sell goods from cigarette beverages within the camp, offer hair cutting or tea for 50 cents (40 pennies), or sell simple foods in a few places in euro.
The Calais prefect’s agency justified that the seats should be dismantled because they represent unpaid taxes and because they are fire-and-purpose risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital in saying that free meals offered by the State and other groups are not providing enough food for an increasing number of people.
They justify that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
In Lille, the Court ordered that 72 temporary tradesmen should be dismissed, there are no legal grounds, but said that Calais’s prefect’s concern was “completely understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, coffee shops and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people under "extremely uncertain conditions".
He said that the rooms offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the locations under the drop-off was the camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose operation is unprofitable and offering 200 meals per day, hours of English and French, as well as asylum for hundreds of vulnerable, single-year-old campers.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s coffee.
A letter sent to the Guardian said the closing of the coffee would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - to the top - after the number of arrivals has risen sharply during the summer.
The price of the space in Finland falls clearly faster than on average in the EU
In Finland, food is sharply reduced to the pleasure of consumers and to the harm of producers.
In Finland, the price of the area has fallen by nearly 5 per cent over three years, with an average price of 0.9 per cent in EU countries.
At the same time, food has become one percent the most expensive in Germany and Sweden.
Over the past three years, food prices have fallen in Finland in most EU countries with a level of salary similar to in Finland.
Only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data appears in the article of the Statistical Development Center, Ilkka Magazine, published on the Information & Trends blog.
The simple comparison of real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the general evolution of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food increased strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price of the EU membership,” Lehtinen said.
Then followed your turn, after which food has become cheaper a year ago.
The prices are now under pressure by Russia’s bans on food imports that have pushed food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products in the Finnish market has increased and the prices of agricultural producers have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers with a short term," Lehtinen says.
The decline in prices in industry and trade has also affected the decline in prices.
The large trade chains of the S group and the Central have both lowered their prices.
Consumer prices have been displayed as displayed advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a type of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries with a similar level of wage as in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food for sale in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He noted that if the comparison countries had the same rate of VAT, they would sell food from similar countries to the cheapest third at the rate of wages in Finland.
It compares Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate had seven in comparable countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finnish.
"If we want to reach the level of old EU countries in the food industry, VAT must be halfway to the middle level of the EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen wrote.
The report notes that its calculations on VAT percentages are directed.
The school is no longer an ex
When you go back to school, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for the school, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-semesters.
This is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty writing is abandoned, and instead, the practice of encoding begins at schools.
Swedish education begins at the age of six, and social learning begins at the age of four.
However, the major change concerns the role of students.
It was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, schooling is trying to make it more interesting.
The world’s longest backbone found – ice cream can live up to 400 years
The ice cream (Somniosus microcephalus) is only 150 years old.
It can live after 250 years, a new study reports.
The numbers make the species the longest backbone of the modern world.
In an animal, it only passes through an Icelandic bump, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland floods along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Narratives make dogs grow longer, they can grow up to more than five meters.
As the growth rate is slow, according to observations, only about a centimeter a year, adults have lived mostly for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified adult ice creams from 28 women who had remained in fishing fish.
The age of fish was revealed by the radiation of glasses.
The average age of the tested hammers was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish, 493 and 502 centimeters of the stock, were revealed for about 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have found that ice creams reach gender capacity only over four meters, researchers have decreased that they are at that stage about 150 years of age.
Research was published by Science.
Stockmann's withdrawals to nearly 300 - sellers are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company with difficulties ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be carried out in terms of resignation," Stockmann said in a statement.
Accordingly, the number of salesmen of goods houses will not be reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, approximately 80 supporting employees are offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockman’s yt-new negotiations concern about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning of the reduction, it was estimated that there were about 380 employees.
With a small reduction, cost savings of around EUR 20 million will be achieved annually for the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an effectiveness programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockman's difficulty in getting profitable from the goods trade.
While the group’s adjusted revenue improves to €11.1 million in the second quarter, the trade of goods is still being lost.
According to Stockman’s CEO Lauri Veija, sales in goods houses have not exceeded the objectives set by the company.
“Reductions in employees are unfortunately necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail’s positive business outcome in 2018,” the report said.
In the second quarter of the result savings background, Lindex’s clothing chain had a good success.
Ketju achieved its turnover and results in the best quarter of all time.
Lindex’s profit increased from €9.5 million to €28.1 million.
Last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s revenue was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the group’s turnover is going to collapse since last year.
The corrected business result is expected to be a little positive this year.
Friday is the rainest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The low-weight centre on the north of Finland holds the weather rain on Friday, the HS meteorologist Ilona Láng said.
Also in the middle of the country there are rainbows, but in the south there is pouch.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as the livestock will be less than 20 degrees in the entire country.
In the northern rain regions, it will be 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team will support the doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach’s temptation
Kenya general athlete John Anzrah was sent home from Rion's Olympics after it appeared that Anzrah appeared in the country's team as a doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete who tried to play Anzrah was a 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, Kenya's team leader, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a Rotichina sample in the surprising test.
Doping officers visited the Anzrah authorities in a statement.
According to Anzrah, Anzrah was sent home because he “have committed a crime against the Kenyan country team.”
He appeared as a athlete, gave a sample of urine and even signed documents.
We can’t accept any use,” the President of the Kenian Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, said in turn, was the news agency for Reuters.
The Olympic general sport begins on Friday, and Rotichin must run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the driver is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was a fourth tournament in the last year and had the winnings of Rion.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan public sports team argued that Anzrah was running on the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the kisali.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
“The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of revealing himself,” the source said.
Where are they all?
The Rion Public Sports Stadium will rubbish its vacuum
Where are they all right?
At least at the Rion Olympics, there is no public sport.
In Ria, the competition was started on Friday, but the world’s top players were able to present their skills as a confusing fool.
The Rion organizers said on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first morning tournament tickets and 65 per cent of the evening tickets were sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium broke out of a hurricane crowd.
Final tickets are already sold in Riga.
The Rion Olympic watch has drawn attention before the general sport.
For example, thousands of empty banks have been seen in rugby, melody and riding views.
When Brazil’s mital wishes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played a beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, it was estimated that only 70% was full.
After Brazilian people, the Netherlands played against Russia, with about 30 per cent of 12,000 people being full of views.
At least the poor people explain that Brazil is far from European and Asian gambling players, and many of the Olympic Games are strange for Brazilians who are playing football.
Nevertheless, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get the football stadium in full.
Mario Andrada, who was a kidnapper, said the tickets had been sold at the time by 82%, which was clearly lower than four years ago.
“The owner still has 1.1 million remains to be sold,” he said.
The 8.5 million London Olympic tickets were sold 8.2 million, although the tickets cost almost half more than Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros for openers.
More than half of the tickets will cost less than €16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Ria because the organizers need money and try to get tickets to sell until the last moment.
In Riga, organizers have actually given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less known species, such as golf and rugby.
At Rion stadium in the morning, there were enough empty places.
Even the Copacaba beach ball has not been interested in the public.
Jukka Central Championship competed in London in 2012.
A lot of papers are enough.
New Way to Protect Nature - Acquire Right to Earth
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the latest nature protection.
The foundation founded last year acquired ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, corporations and entities can repay ownership rights in the land area with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapis.
The area is virtually divided into blocks that you want to acquire for a payment of ownership.
The holder receives a veto right to the size of 187 square blocks, meaning in practice that each holder is not required to be approved if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
The ownership rights can also be purchased for more blocks.
Acquiring a governance law is something concrete that may leave your legacy or give it a gift.
You don’t have to leave to wear banderoles or complain about yourself somewhere to protect nature,” said Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the company of the management law.
You will receive exact location information from your block, which allows you to visit, for example, the block.
On the Foundation website, the names of the ownership rights acquired are amazing on the same map where the block details of the area are found.
A widespread weight sees its natural conservation procurement as a risk only that the foundation’s activity changes from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a public-interest foundation aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and the nature.
The risk is that the foundation acts somehow irrelevant or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Holder project is the protection of natural areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land areas either by buying or as a gift.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protective countries.
It also aims to move outside the borders of Finland and plans to import countries from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki merchant on August 13-19.
Bicycle robbers are tormented by the worst of major cities in Turku - see the situation of your hometown
Bicycle robbers are tormented by Finland’s biggest cities in Turku.
This year there is more bicycles stolen than in nine of the largest cities.
Based on wheel ruptures reported to the police, the number of bicycles stolen in January-September of this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants were calculated in the ten largest cities.
In addition to the tour, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were raised.
According to the police, four to five wheel stealing per thousand inhabitants occurred.
In Espoo and Kouvol, only about two thousand wheel stealing per population were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"In other cities, the number of thefts is doubled in proportion to the population compared to other cities," police officer Tommi Reen said.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels are stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have the answer to that.
“The generality of lights can affect how much in the city is moved by wheels and how much wheels are above,” said Temu Mother.
The police government Tommi Reen is very expected to rise in comparison with Turku, Helsinki and Oulu.
The number of wheelchairs goes largely depending on what are school and cycling cities.
The market has a narrow center, short distances and a lot of wheels to offer for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a completely different city where the city centers are far from each other and the bike is not necessarily a primary mobility tool,” Reen says.
In January-September, all of Finland's police information has been reported to have a little less wheel loss than last year.
Great joy is still not a subject.
Despite the decline in recent years, more than 20,000 wheel stealing is reported by the police every year.
It means 50-60 filars every day and only about 4,000 wheels a year in Helsinki.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In reality, the thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims report the stealing to the police.
Reen calls for people to make a criminal report on wheel stealing, even less than every ten police officers reported.
The typical detected wheel stealing is the one where the police gets information about the stealing immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
“The incidents will also occur in other investigations when, for example, the stealing wheels in the apartment can be found,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, wheelchairs are arrested each week by the work itself or in the case of a police investigation, says senior counterpart Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, the wheels are stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, inner wheelchairs, warehouses, and wheelchairs from virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
Individual wheel models are stolen most like the Jopoes in the past years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some stealing takes a wheel, for example, for their own use, but most of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the internet.
They will stay in their own market.
“At least the police haven’t learned that the stolen wheels would hardly go abroad,” Reen says.
The buyers of stolen wheels, according to the police, are ordinary Finnish.
Some of you must buy a stolen bike unknown.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of crash or infringement.
“The clock should be called if the wheels are sold at a clear lower price,” Reen says.
Special library officer Severi Hirvi is always carrying the color of his Nops during his working day to protect the Kallion library in Helsinki.
He had five pieces of wheels, but none of them was stolen, the monster says, "There's never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"Maybe this doesn't so attract thieves, there's probably no hipster value here," the Hellenic monster thinks.
In the chaos in Helsinki Kalli, the Siiri Valve quickly closed its bike with a small u-look.
Now the wheel knocked the kiosk against the wall, but typically Valve locks its wheel into some fixed, such as a wheelchair.
"It's going to be a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," the Helsinky student says about his white bike, whose wallet alone paid about five hundred euros.
All the time friends hear that the wheels have been spent.
"Even for bad wheels, such a ruin-Jopes."
The wheel was stolen from the interior of the home company a year ago.
The wheel was unlocked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be done.
People under the age of 15 are responsible for crimes?
Helsinki is experiencing US-famous compartment teams
In Helsinki, the so-called verbal lighting team is tested to prevent young people from entering the crime centre.
Initially, the trial applies to those under the age of 15 who are now without criminal liability.
The Comparison Team is missing the first youth to commit a crime.
The idea is that the Comparative Commission discusses the incident with the criminal and imposes a penalty.
A week later, the offender can join the Prosecutor in order to compensate for his deeds.
Other consequences can be, for example, a letter written to the family that explains what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio tells us that the model is not strict.
We also have other matching models that are used simultaneously.
"Everything is guided by the young man's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything will not go astray from the first mistake," Laitio says.
The Comparison Office has taken a model from the United States where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young man, after his first crime, is not ahead of the adult panel, but reflected what happened in his direction with the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The experienced service design agency, Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, says that it was an accident that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes for younger than 15 years have not been treated before.
“It’s been a message that keep on choosing the road,” Lovio says.
The Comparative Team is part of the Helsinki Project for immigrants youth, which is based on the city of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to everyone in need, not only to immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling for the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was published by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is directed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
Signatures want the party’s money to be transferred to Congress elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
"We believe that the disputes caused by Donald Trump, as well as his incompatibility, inability, and recording disobedience threaten to bring a vote round to the Democrats in these elections," Police said in a statement.
Only the directing of all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from falling into Trump’s neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning presidential elections will decrease day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatures include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman, and Vin Weber.
One of the organizational individuals of the letter is apparently Trump’s opponent Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein said that the letter came from "people who want to protect the party's majority at Congress" and that there is no support for anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump, believed to have lost millions of voters.
In addition, it is said to have demonstrated dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security said in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump.
Clinton promises to facilitate U.S. children’s families
In the United States, Democratic President Hillary Clinton told the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I strive to be President to make the U.S. economy good for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a statement.
Clinton’s plan is in the middle of a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by tax increases of rich people, in part by private money.
The construction program is a hand-building for American dune routes suffering from the transfer of factories to cheap labour countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good wages after World War II.
We are a builder, we need to come back to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the role of children who work.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, pointing out that rich people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the U.S. as a taxpayer, it must pay the departure tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement that he has previously supported.
"As the President, I oppose all trade agreements that work against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the Washington Post speculations published before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was intending to criticize the economic programme announced by the Republicans by Donald Trump on Monday that it “is only taking such millionaires.”
Trump’s proposal to cut down on corporate taxes Clinton has previously called Trump’s “pornstar”.
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded the listeners of small businesses whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes Trump himself made in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America big again, he should start making himself products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rion viewing numbers: Kittens haven't joined Finnish to the edge of the windows, but the mobile app is interested in
Usually, sports halls are viewed in television spectator statistics as hard mountain tops.
The Rion Olympics haven’t achieved a huge number of viewers so far.
At the same time, 12 percent of the population have been closer to the squares: the swim was followed by 615,000 viewers from the Olympic Channel TV2 on Tuesday.
For comparison, the one-month rear EM championships received nearly 800 000 viewers at the end of TV2, and the second million EM championships were real.
So far, the Olympic Games have been most interested in the cycling on Sunday and the five-day streaming, which both reached nearly half a million viewers at the same time.
Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the numbers of viewers and reminds the viewers of Rion Olympics for the first time in several different ways.
In addition to TV, the Finnish follows the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers are choosing the Olympics.
The TV viewers are also distributed on TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
Rion Olympics are the first sports players to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is less than in the 2012 London Games or in the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is to explain the time difference in contributing - a large portion of Rio's posts come from the nighttime in Finland.
Another reason for his interest - if somebody now considers it to be - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise figure from the beginning, the interest would have been pumped up with it.
In addition, public sports are only at the beginning, as well as other Finnish species of interest: boat riding and riding.
Initially, the numbers of viewers were nearly expected, according to Pokkis.
When the public sport begins, the views are exploding.
The Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which rose in the first days of the games, became the most downloaded app in the Apple App Store in Finland for free.
By Monday, the application was uploaded 150,000 times.
I would like to say that we're going on the 200,000 loading paths.
"We'll only get the views of the network later."
Rio Areena hasn't worked for all users hopefully.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the mistakes have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other small technical problems at the initial stage.
Apps have received updated versions to fix errors.
Rion Olympics are seen on the Channels and Arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some species, and Yle Speech transmits chickens every day on radio.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most working animals for Y'l ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed by Y'l channels.
From 2018 to 2018, the Olympic sports will be displayed on both over and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to the official report, Finland’s deepest lake is your day, with a depth of 95.3 meters on the Cross.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical scholar, found a pressure of about 20 square meters on the cross, with a depth of 104 meters on the ground.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Centre tried to confirm the observation with a mini-consumer.
The method may not necessarily find a small depth of 100 meters, development engineer Jari Hakala says.
So far, the official depth is 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvas Water (90 meters).
More than 80 meters from Saimaa, Reiswater and Head Lake.
They have not been investigated as accurately as the Day.
In particular, the bottom of the Inar Lake is not accurately mapped.
“There could be some unknown depths,” Kannela said.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Juka lake, 23 meters.
In this regard, your Day will not reach the deepest ten, and the Suvas Water will be even longer than the top.
Repair of 12 August at 14:29: Repair of the last paragraph where the deepest lakes in their medium depths were wrong.
Immigrant taxes: Retirement taxes are still more
Retirement taxes are still more stable than salaries.
Ihalainen says that the inconvenience occurred under representative elections and the pension tax was promised to equate salaries.
The government’s presentation does not include such a thing.
We believe that it should definitely be.
The promises should be fulfilled after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wagemakers had reduced jobs that would reduce taxes.
The case was warmed by representatives of the opposition at the House of Representatives, who denounced those of the Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbi's election permissions.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihail, in the line of taxation presented by Minister of State for Finance Petteri Orpon, it is mainly about safeguarding and not increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax reduction has a positive impact on buying power and employment if other things do not increase human uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipil (center) and Orpo to respect the competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the main economic and employment policy of the government.
It has been done by the power of the labour market organizations, so it should not be questioned.
This is necessary because the economy is so much in the stocks of domestic demand and people's own future.
Long-term unemployment
The idea is to appeal to the government that it would be affected by long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
Long-term unemployment was approximately 17,000 more in June than a year before.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's goal will escape from the rise of employment to 72 per cent.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is left behind, there is a very large social decline in the authorisation.
Ambassador: In Thai attacks, Finnish sugars are not known
At least four people died in the bombs that occurred in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finnish to be careful in the country and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish Christians who are traveling to Thailand have no reason to withdraw their trip due to explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphale says.
Very few Finnish in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finnish in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish Thai travel season is a year-round tour.
Most Thai travelers come from Southern Europe and China from this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish residents in Thailand on Facebook after the bomb attacks.
The Embassy has tried to target particularly Finnish people in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact personnel in Hua Hin are currently away from the city.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphale says.
No information about the factor
Westphalen says there is no information about the attack factor yet.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be associated with the political discouragement of the Thai society and the last week's referendum on the drafting of a military constitution.
The law was adopted in the referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
People were arrested, among other things, who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethnic and national conflict involving the Muslim population, Westphale says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination rights.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been spread to tourist attractions.
Today, Bangkok is a great local celebration, Westphale says.
According to him, in the city they celebrate the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the day’s journey so that the authorities are very accurate about security.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say attacks are a "local sabotage" and differ from ordinary terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, the Thai police news agency said.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have been explosived across the country, such as tourists’ favorites in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In Finland’s favorite tourist destination, the holiday home in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says the Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require deaths.
Two bombs exploded at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
The popular tourist destination in Hua Hin has, according to local authorities, explosed a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double bombs.
In addition, in South Thailand, Surat Than's village and in Trang's city, at least one bomb was exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists as it is transported to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The attacker is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, leader of the Thai military mission, the attacker has not yet been known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We don’t want people to panic anymore,” he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the factors were intended to destroy the country's tourism because all of the attacks have occurred in tourist attractions.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the attention of Finnish residents in the country to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish traveling to Thailand is not a reason to withdraw their trip due to explosions, but it is worth paying attention to the instructions of high-speed caution, Westphale says.
Injured Europeans
The attacks and their victims occurred during the night of Finland are very little known to date.
Last year's attack in Hua Hin was expected to get a little bit more information.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last strike in Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the famous watch tower.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin from which it believes they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bank, according to the governor of the province.
The municipality’s employee died in the attack.
There are at least one injured.
CNN's interviewed police chief says the attack of Surat Than also has been used by two bombs that explode every half an hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs were explosive in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won the Women's Fourth
Alexandra Raisman was a second score of 60,098 and Russia's third score of 58,665 points, Alija Mustafina.
Biles, 18, is still targeting the championships in the games of Rion with permanence, hype and trees.
Biles has managed the violence of women over the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from three of the previous seasons.
He won the championships of four games and permanon three times in a consecutive manner as well as the boom last and the second year.
In the U.S. team in Biles, two teams have won the world championship.
The bigger MMs in Biles have jumps and trees.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Isle has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombing attacks on tourism with the real estate agency and children's playground in the same property in Phuket.
If there are no more strikes, I don’t think there will be any more miracles in this regard, considering Huovila as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
Experienced entrepreneurs have seen nearly many tragedy experienced in Thailand.
There's always something here.
The first was a tsunami, then a bird influenza, and last year a bomb shot in Bangkok.
If these people haven’t escaped tourists, that’s not the case.
The company's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
He heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local hours and said he wouldn't have to come to the office.
Note that both the beach street and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the disputes were placed for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to a Friday celebration in Thailand.
At Patong, the mood was calm and the main street movements allowed to open about 10 o'clock local time.
Many people haven’t even heard of the attacks on the beach.
About half of the day in Thailand's time Patong traffic had normalised and a large number of stores had opened their doors.
Based on the spot, the explosion has been quite small, and on the spot visiting Huovila says.
Later, the car was seen in the Kruuce at Jouxholmint.
When the police arrived, the car was burned.
The party found a man who had been hiding in a nearby moon.
Another man was arrested immediately.
The other man fled, but he was later found in the forest with a police dog.
Men are suspected of the traffic stealing, stealing and serious damage.
The police thank you for the advice given.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Transmission to Clear Discrimination
In Russia, on Friday, a high-value leadership change took place in the years when President Vladimir Putin separated his government chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's follower is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's a former diplomat and acts as Ivanov's two-person man.
The Kangas Party says that the cause of Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling of lead tasks is one way of using the revolution.
This is a way to prevent people from becoming independent of the president.
According to the Kangas Party, it is also possible that Ivanov has been injured with or defeated with other managers.
Asemanpudotus Ivanoville
Ivanov, who belonged to Putin’s internal circle, is moving to the specific tasks of environmental and transport.
Putin said the change in a joint decision by expressing the state media.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for transfer to other tasks and proposed Vaino to be in place, Russia Today said.
The Kangas Party says that from the point of view of Ivanov it is a clear outbreak of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's important order.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB.
He was considered a possible follower of Putin in 2008, but he became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
The Kangas Party notes that the old card, such as governors, has recently been exchanged in Russia.
An older researcher, Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute, says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov’s place is that Putin turns his neighbor to a younger.
ISIS players used civilians as a human race in withdrawal in Syria
They used civilians as human race when they fled to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Organization, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were transported to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters received about 90 percent of the important Manbij city for Father.
However, dozens of jihads remained in the city at that time.
Repaired earlier news at 19:30: Earlier, we wrongly told the civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, the ISIS players kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The documentation of the Ministry of Interior is illegal
The lines of the Ministry of Interior on the publicity of documents are illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of Public Law from the University of East Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the documentation cannot be based on the authority’s own lines, but is based on law.
The Ministry of Interior had previously refused to grant a list of participants to the Minister of Interior occasions to the Night of Sanoma.
The Minister justified the decision by the instructions of the Council of State and by the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting office.
The ministry’s Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Riga
As in recent years, Bolt has been running under the value matches against time.
From the beginning of the season, he had his back and had to leave the Olympics in Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I’m much better.
I've been practicing well and it's key, Bolt said at his press conference in Riga.
This press facility contained small ports and fans that became journalists.
Porina Bolt undermines the fact that the Jamaican star has risen during the periods in which the general sport has fought with doping scandals and swinging interest.
Bolt's previous loss in the 2004 Olympics occurred in Athens, where he collapsed at the start of 200 meters at 21.05.
At that time, Bolt, a 17-year-old, was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and found your workspace.
Four years later, in Beijing, his power began with a hundred meters, breaking the world record and competitors’ self-confidence despite the end of the celebration, at the time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later in the Berlin World Cup, Bolt achieved his career by measuring the law point.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 meters and 19.19 meters are still valid.
In Riosa, Bolt has announced its target of a 200-meter world record and a 19-second submission, but nobody believes its creation except Bolt himself.
The most challenging player of Bolt is Justin Gatlin, the 2004 Olympic player in Athens.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt bloomed the American in just one hundred seconds.
Bolt hasn't lost any time in the final of the matches in Beijing during his reign.
In 2011, Boltilta remained unreleased in the 2011 World Cup final.
Bolt will fill a wealthy week after 30.
He's an old man in young men's species, and Rion's games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's championships in London for the last time.
These are the Olympics that distinguish me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reflections about Riga: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhuan, Chinese journalist Chen Xinyi, 18, has issued a positive doping show at the Rion Olympics.
Chinese doping officer Chen Xinyin found traces of prohibited substances in the doping sample.
Bulgarian drinkers Silvia Danekova are also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan public sports coach was passed home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He settled in Riga as a fourth woman in 100 meters of peril.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese journalist has exported his doping case to the CAS of the International Petition Court for Sports.
Xinhua says that the sample given by Xinyin on Sunday had been found signs of hydrochlorothiazide diuretic.
There are also other doping suspects in Riga.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female drinker Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
In turn, Kenya has moved Riga to the home of a general sports coach due to a doping crack.
The International Olympic Committee KOK said Thursday that the Kenya coach had become a test athlete and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media, Kenya’s fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mailin, he had used the Ferguson Rotich, a 800-metre driver.
Phelpsis doesn't stop anything - historical gold came into screen style
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, Michael Phelps swims 200 meters between his 22th Olympic tournament in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimming pool of the same species in the four-star Olympics.
The Phelps win time was 1.54.66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was secondly in a mixture before China’s Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs at an early evening interview.
Helen Skelton (Ok.) is the most read on this week's Dinner website.
Rebecca Adlington's fourth commentary.
Skelton doesn’t have much stress if the soma or the British press has a little bit of his revealing and special residents.
The TV is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton has been dressed in high-altitude shoes and short hairdresser with at least enough reflectivity - at least in the eyes of many conservative british cowboys.
The back steps are not permitted.
It’s important to look good, and the small crowds are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to hydrate and maybe be disturbed, but he emphasizes that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We are watching sports here, and we need to be athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I'm dressed.
Can you imagine that the size has exceeded Finland?
I can't, but all that focuses on how hard these swimmers do things and how great sacrifices they do, it's okay for me, Skelton.
You know what?
It's an empty thing if it comes to dressing (drinker).
I'm a little interested if such a person is in touch with someone.
Rion police arrested two for terrorist suspicion

85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of Rion's races.
Police exploded a suspected package in Riga
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rion basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball area and closed the place to the public.
The police entered the public after the explosion was controlled.

Argentinian lady rushed to Syria - Finnish protests
The storm in Petra-Sirena had a colorful competition day in Riga.
The storm of Petäjä-Siren was severe on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady hit the wind of Petra-Sirene on Thursday in Rio at the start of the day of women’s surfing.
The wind was broken.
The opponent admitted the break.
He stayed drunk because of the coach, and others fled, Finnish chief coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete has been considering the protest for a long time.
It shouldn’t be done because it would have been unfair according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Sire said.
The Finnish climbed on the floor until the last time, because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rion.
The Finnish stayed at the 27th place in his departure.
The 2012 Olympic Olympic Championship in London is eight.
In the case of the coach, the coach was hardly affected.
Friday is an important day when departures are 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the First Knowledge, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things that Scientificly Enlarge the Age
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to the life of a person.
Some of the things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life extends.
Sometimes things that a person can’t affect himself can bring him extra beds.
Such are, among other things, the tendency to middle-class obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't always need to beat - just a milk cup is enough.
The secret of a long age has been attempted to explore many different studies.
Medical Daily presented the seven most strange results of the study.
According to science, all of these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking Cake and Coffee
Coffee drinks have been found to protect against cancer, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A study at Harvard University found that moderate consumption of coffee is associated with "reduced death risk", particularly with regard to neurological or heart diseases.
For alcohol, studies say that reasonable use - one of three days - may extend life.
For example, one found that winemakers lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of teeth can extend the life of a person for more than six years, a study says.
The claim is based on that it prevents sensational inflammation.
They can also contribute to the emergence of other diseases elsewhere in the human head.
A study in Norway found how laughing had an impact on human life.
The seven-year project was monitored by more than 45,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to live after the experiment.
Sex, when the protection from gender diseases is observed, is for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order to get extra beds in his life, he also needs to get an orgasm.
Movement, of course, brings additional years, it is not going to be disputed.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute legality.
A study at the University of Oxford found that women with a large backbone were lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these aspects to low mortality.
Whether it’s the Olympic medal player or the Oscar-winning actress, he is more likely to live longer than the usual.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation can be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life extra years.
Some researchers again suspect that the long age is once again due to the social status of a person - which, for example, contributes to the achievement of Nobel Prize recognitions.
A study of shopping behaviour over 65 years of age found that a daily shopping person is less likely to make shopping a parent.
This is because rotating in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to break down biological mechanisms that may slow down death.
Therefore, count your credit card from your hands - the online shop does not have the same effect.
Umpihuma’s railroad driver jumped to the truck
In particular Finland, a serious truck and a person’s nockleader took place on Friday evening.
The accident occurred between the Koske, Touch and Sorvaston Road on Friday at 21.00.

The rescue agency removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to the University Center Hospital of Turin.
The result of the woman's explosion test was 2.02 promille.
He is suspected of a severe rail drink.
Posts sent out to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in the K-Citymarket's resignation of cancer as the mail had delivered some of the load damaged to the Winter River.
Teija Haltia, who was in Pernius, was on Thursday purchasing exit tickets from the Salon K-Citymarket, when it turned into a fun cold.
Unfortunately, there are shortcomings because Posti delivered our cargo to the Senegal River!
We'll get more when Posti gets the cargo delivered!
If you don't crash in the crash, read coldly.
The cooling shop is associated with the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to also apply to food cutting.
It is always available in the post until the end of August.
Haltian believes the cold was mostly interesting and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in a hurry.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention drawn by this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, the Haltian update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favourite touched on his left-handed pocket, although a few camps were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the Post’s Corporate Transport Services, regretted the damage to the Night of Sanoma.
The background is that three out of five tables of yesterday were disappointed in the wrong place (the Sun River) and we were no longer going to make the submissions (Salon) with three, but we only took five tables today, Kaidesoja told the evening-Sanom.
This is the first news of the evening.
Teija Haltia didn’t get stunned by the cold because she found all of her own favorites from the selection.

Hope for a woman murdered in Loviisa family: Remindments of victims for the sake of police dogs
A week ago, the 42-year-old family of a woman who was killed in Loviisa wishes the victim to be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donating for the police work.
Sipoon’s Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it provides the victim’s family’s wish to give a gift to police dogs for the sake of the family.
The publication says that the victim had done the Sipoon as a veterinary station, and also performed his nurse training there.
The veterinary station remembers women with words that touch.
Enjoyable, smart, humorous, and unfeasible work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes the account number where donations can be transferred.
The update notes that grant funds are entirely going to the police dogs, primarily for the acquisition of safeguards.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovish woman was murdered at her home in Lovish Koskenkyl.
Women's neighbours have said that the victim was very animal.
He possessed several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, cannons and flowers.
A 27-year-old suspect of the murder did not know a woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer was injured by a police dog Börje, who was injured in a life-threatening detention situation.
But the bull remained alive and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal issued a judgment on breach of equality law to Post
The post was not entitled to retain the wage of the employee who refused to retire the renter, Kanta-Hämee’s Court of Appeal in its judgment.
The Court of Appeal obliged Post to pay the employee most of the wage held and €2,000 for discrimination.
According to the sentence, Posti could have detained the householder's wage only from a part that corresponded to the part of the householder's work throughout the day.
According to the Court of Appeal, the employee was placed in a more unfavorable position on the basis of his vocational association on the contrary to the equality law.
The employee had respected the Postal and Logistics Union of the PAU organization’s decision on a ban on familiarisation.
During last November of the post office, PAU made a decision that the employees of the Post wouldn’t stop hiring employees.
It was the news of the people first.
Returning to the path of respect for human rights in Turkey

Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the situation in Turkey for human rights.
In the past, the Journalist Union called on Sipil and Sonia to express their concerns for the freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly imported into Turkey the importance of press and freedom of expression.
Putin separated the head of his administration - the state of the Estonian Vaino
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has separated President Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin.
Soviet-Estonia Communist leader Karl Vaino is the son of Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice-Chairman of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
It will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax reports.
Vladimir Putin issued a resignation to the Chief of the Government.
Putin's close internal circle, Ivanov, according to the Kremlin newspaper, is moving to the specific tasks on environmental and transport issues.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for transfer to other tasks and proposed Vaino to be in place, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB's spying.
Many considered Ivanovi as possible Putin's successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin was re-electioned as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant deal for a game ban - can't be seen in the opening of the election league
The world recorder of football transfers cannot be seen on the field when the England election is deported during the weekend.
Paul Pogba's film ban was accompanied in England.
Manchester United's giant dealer Paul Pogba is on the side of ManU's opening league against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said Friday.
According to the UK, ManU paid Pogba's Italian expansion to Juventuks for EUR 105 million.
However, the English Football League FA keeps him away from the game, because Pogba has remained a game ban on Juventus.
He got two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it will be a game ban.
The ban was transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
The next game is the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
Flow's greatness is good.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have stabilized the status of Flow Festival as an internationally recognized event highlighted by world top artists.
The Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
The festival visitors are typically expressed in their own costume.
One of the main artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is stagnated amongst other things with a workpiece and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have only a headquarters and a knife,” said the artistic director of the event, Thomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will be held this weekend in the Helsinki Summer Valley, has grown from the small card history to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question in the background of success: What factors would you like to go to?
In the event, it is quite different to think about this.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of need and to be delivered in accordance with authority orders, said the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would end this year to sell.
The goal was to increase the number of 70,000 visitors last year by 5,000 souls.
The festivals will also be seen this year with a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it is necessary to finance somehow.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle, which is guided in a huge ride.
That's what we don't want.
In the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been overwhelmed so that there are 130 participants in the partly-runed area, art installations, as well as numerous restaurants and drink bars.
In addition to the main and smaller streams of incidence, this year, 15,000 people have a tent.
Stone admits that the event could be done more simply.
Maybe I'm a little big, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If it disappears, this is no longer our case.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done for the stone is that large visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event in the mid-20th century, the operation was very dependent on the aid of about EUR 20 000 in Helsinki.
Last year, Flow’s shareholders’ turnover was about six million euros.
It allows you to create “class things,” such as the building of a tent of 73 meters wide.
Flow's visitors are typically expressed in their own clothing.
Along with the music event, you can also talk about the trendy adult community of young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as a particular fashion.
We want to be separated, first of all, from content.
However, fashion phenomena also match the Flow’s value world: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is the legend of the punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan team in his own genre, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rabbit, and soula in a combined festival that is the most typical event.
Iggy was busted because it's probably the last time we see this in the dark in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what commercial radio calls.
Iggy's last album is fucking good, and he's been doing fucking good stuff in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower boxes - tourists escaped in terror
In Hua Hin, local time exploded two bombs on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently covered in the flower box and exploded with mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists were starting to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police representative Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Since 1989, wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted about the attacks with a lot of talk.
If the TV doesn't look right, you can see it here.
At least 11 injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowd ran to me and said that the bomb was exploding at the bars.
It took place in one of the biggest bars, told Swedish director Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon afterwards, the Finnish preferred on the island of Phuket, two bombs exploded.
No one knows he's dead.
At the same time, another double bomb was shot in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
In addition, one bomb was explosed in Trang City.
Police said they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin, which had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombs that are not satisfied with the action of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, this may also be the case with criminal organizations.
Aftonbladet said the police have recently been arrested in the activities of criminal organizations that are dealing with trafficking in humans.
KSML: This part of the new ready-made forces starts in the first battle in the military situation
In an acute situation, warriors are only ordered to fight for a few months after a military swearing, says Central Finland.
According to General Jukka Sonnisen, for example, in the military situation, the chief of training of the Defense Forces interviewed, only those eligible are at the final stage of their training.
According to the training manager, reserves are first assigned to the service.
None of the guards or reserves are ordered to do the task for which no required training has been given, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin to train craftsmen in immediate capacity units from next year.
The units can be used in military operations, if necessary, already during equipment training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation from home
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard dispute in the apartment they purchased from Espoo in 2009.
The two-storey trade price was EUR 330 000.
However, after the trade, a serious humidity problem was revealed at home, causing a health-threatening microbial growth.
The pair had to be sold as an excavator of the apartment in 2014.
The sales price was up to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Warom was raised to EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case and asked for a discount from the seller there.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the courts and the courts.
The court issued a judgment in the case on Wednesday.
It was in force of the court's judgment, which ordered the seller to pay a price discount of EUR 150,000 to Tola and Rome.
In addition, the seller will have to replace the court and clearance costs of a pair of EUR 47,344.
The right was reasonable to lower prices a bit because the need for a certain housing was already known to buyers when they were making a cottage.
However, the construction errors argued by the law were significantly more serious than was stated.
Tola is looking for a good home.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically searched for a well-being home because they did not want to make repairs.
He had the idea that the building has been fixed and in good condition and that there is no harm to the matters mentioned in the rehabilitation inspection report.
The rehabilitation inspection report referred to as risks and inaccessible ventilation and the lack of control of water and rainfalls along the rocky surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, there was no evidence that it would have been no urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma had the idea that rainwater from the rock should be somewhat controlled within a few years.
The stores were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, the moisture problems of the apartment were much more serious.
Audits conducted in 2012 and 2013 in the building found microbial growth, which, according to the Witnesses, were due to both the rainwater and the capillary rise of the earthquake.
The air polluted by microbes on the west side of the house was estimated by the inspector to access the interior through the coating.
A home or hideout cross-border values were found in the samples of the home care room, the lounge door, the lounge window, and the lounge washing room.
The terraces were built without permissions
The law also questioned whether the apartment was extended in violation of the building permit.
The Court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo that was made against the permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the copyright law, on the basis of the information received by the seller before the trade, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for measured repairs in the future.
Tola and Waroma believe that there was no particular reason for a broader standard inspection.
Buyers have not forgotten their reporting obligation, the law of court is noted in their judgment.
Charming archive: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - in the registry also Finnish
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article about how microfilm documents are stored in the National Archives of Maryland in the United States about a total of 218,500 women wishing to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish women, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish women, and 31 Swedish women.
Documents and registry cards originate from a Nazi-German racial agency.
Heinrich Himmler, SS Director of the Rate Agency.
No SS man in Nazi-Germany received children before he had been investigated by a SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women have been conducted gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
The racial agency examined women’s backgrounds by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the gender of women.
Women should also be willing to abandon their Swedish citizenship and give the racial agency handwritten lifestyles and good recommendations from close friends.
The racial agency wanted to ensure that women were "children", "savings" and "good national socialists" who were well able to speak German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the wedding of SS men.
There is no way to tell us how 14 Finnish women were found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-supported program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
The program also stipulated that each SS husband should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
Lifeborn homes take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the program has not been very actively advanced, the U.S. Holocaust Museum pages are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage spending by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother’s honour was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
Marriages between "Aryans" and "No-Aryans" in Nazi-Germany were prohibited by law, on museum pages.

Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was posted in a couple of hours of night: "I was so clothed"
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorites for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who is the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of the dancers and festivals, continues to broke from the bar in 1995 to tango, and is still at the right rise.
The book written by Mari Koppise on the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was published on Thursday.
In the book, Silankop tells about his life and career both in good and in bad.
The bridge's career rose to a total rise when he won the Tango Corona in the Tango River Seinäe in 1995.
In the cat Sillanpää sang tangs, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had drawn to Sillanpää at the request of a man a tangocap, which Kassu Halonen fits in a slightly different form.
The Satulinna chapter became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
In the book, however, the sound of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanhead sang it to the band in a terrible crash and only after a couple of hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so tired!
The bridge is remembered in the book.
As a huge hit, the recording of the song wouldn't be thought to be singing in the crap.
Although I wasn’t physically my best, the trace was still good.
I learned that all the time I don’t have to demand complete and superiority.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of the man, which is reported in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanhead separated from his partner, and the case finally ended with the gold chapter you deserve, which was published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Saara Törmäss were not the same as Sillanpää wished.
The bridge had imagined he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of the song that tells the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of 7 days.
In the newspaper, Jar and his ex-love were the reasons for Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol abuse, but Jar said that it was a full puppy and did not think it was true.
According to the book, Jari was angry with the record company and refused to sing the song, but finally ended up singing it - and well so.
In June, the British were surprised by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of voters had half a difference and 48 per cent had remained in the Union, although the vote week's opinions predicted the opposite outcome.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of remaining in the EU.
No appreciated research institute or university has flagged the difference on behalf of a couple of individual researchers, although a couple of individual researchers had to agree with the vast stream of their profession.
The theme of former U.S. President Bill Clinton's later election campaign "It's the economy, stupid" flew to the brexit band in the UK's Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the main thing in politics.
Economical language
The Centre for Macroeconomics in its last month’s interview with the professional will find answers to the Brexit catastrophe.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened because this time voters made a decision on other than financial grounds.
One of the economics’ explanations for the loss of the economy is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the imagination that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employees, which is almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's right away from the UK.
Many also have the idea that the decline in currency value would be a good thing because it promotes export industry.
According to the Economist, voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficient.
They were dismissed, in particular, by the equality of the BBC, which gave just a few percent of the EU’s profitable economists as well as the overpowering majority.
The EU has not been interested in telling me what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other mixtures of economic mathematics are of the consequences.
These remote literature mixtures spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, state debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both heard and understood, then they were not interpelled, because economists represent a elite with which voters don’t have their own interests.
Academics such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, immigrants crash your hospital, immigrants use you.
These arguments were stuck.
Each cafe has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would have in the UK if they left?
In each health centre’s waiting room there are immigrants.
How much easier does the UK get medical time if they don’t?
In every school there are children of immigrants.
How much easier can true British children get a school if they get rid of it?
In every city there are foreigners.
How much more space would be for the starters if they were gone?
I think these are economic issues.
They relate to jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them, and if they failed, their response was not visible.
Economists have failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the UK has more jobs, less health centers and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are the net payers of the UK's public economy and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen’s real estate fund is ready for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is responsible for real estate investment by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen was scheduled to make Brexit in time by developing A and B plans.
The plan B, i.e. the EU-profit camp, began to be prepared for the victory of a few weeks prior to the vote in order to leave the result.
The concern was that investors were starting to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds usually do not have measured liquid funds, but now they might be necessary.
We went to raise cash resources.
When Brexit took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund’s cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen of Aberdeen’s only openness daily notably about the real estate fund that news concerns.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund was 3.5 billion pounds at that time.
The value of the company’s funds is about £20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen about all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimates that the low amount of cash in these funds remained to ten percent or even below it.
The real estate funds were prepared for a very different strategy for Brexit.
Funds close trade
When the EU’s profitable camp won, Europe was confused.
However, the lack of two weeks of vote on the real estate market was quite calm, says Olden.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the spokesman Mark Carney, CEO of the British Central Bank, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition to real estate funds, the first, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
They together stealed the situation and raised the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared in 2007 and 2008, says Olden.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to rotate, and after another, the fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the cash resources collected, but it was finally forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not really close the trade, but changed the price down.
In practice, investors were given time with him to consider whether it is worthwhile to pull money out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you didn't have to take your money out now, it wouldn't suffer because it would be lost.
It calmed the situation, and most of it revoked the notification.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been a couple of weeks very calm, Olden says.
He notes that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner-European Funds have had nothing similar to it.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Uncertain attention to real estate funds
The oldest believes that the closures of real estate funds traded have gained quite a lot of attention.
Open funds covered by closed funds govern about 4 percent of UK real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen took six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still attached.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds back to the end of 2017.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been cut down, but the situation does not look "warther" for Aberdeen.
Most of the issues are now about the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, he noted.
The price of pound and dollar is the lowest for 30 years, in addition to having a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar owner can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are lots of buyers, old says.
Brexit brings downsides to the real estate market in London
In the morning, the situation wasn't really bad yet.
But four, when Pertti Vanhane, responsible for the real estate investments of the British Real Estate Fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
You've got a strong head in it.
I realized that this is going to plan B now, says Olden in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work right away.
London City was completely alive despite the morning night.
The regularly non-sound-adjusted TV panels at the office were reporting news, and normally the people were silent to fully listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stood before the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screens were only red.
It was a morning that he never thought he was alive, says the old man.
Not because, despite the mystery, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote.
The sense was confused.
However, the company was well reserved for the option, and therefore the situation was somehow calm, Olden says.
Brexit Voting Starts Repair Movement
The storm followed the vote.
Punta broke, the British leadership went to exchange.
The markets began to predict severe declines on the real estate market in Britain and especially in London.
London’s offices were expected up to 20% mins in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade after one another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the poison is gone, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it doesn’t show up on the faces of the old man who spent this week in Helsinki.
It is still too early to say much about what the Brexit follows.
So much is still open: how the difference is happening and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the real estate market in London has already been obtained.
CBRE’s information on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, all real estate prices in London fell 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, a minimum of 6.1% was accumulated, Olden listed.
The numbers are not so horrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have been worse, says Olden.
All equally large falls occurred in the years of crisis 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was quite quickly compared to Lehman’s fall and the US real estate market to the global economic crisis.
The old man believes that the comparison is not quite part of it, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
The sense is another.
The real estate market has now not seen panic sales like that at that time, but willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
The funding can also be found normally.
Repair could have been in front of any case.
In fact, it’s not surprising that the price fixing motion could have been ahead without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices for real estate in London and other cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially offices are overpriced, says Olden.
So the fall began very high.
Prices in London have been posted up for four reasons, the Old List.
The UK economy has grown strongly, the London population has grown strongly.
Another major trend is that real estate is the last grade of property that is globalizing, says Olden.
New investors from the Middle East and Asia have become marketed, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as an easy city destination.
In addition, prices have been fed a low interest rate, which is why, for example, pension companies have had to seek revenue for new items.
This loan has been easily available - although the debt fund has been used, according to the Old Testament, now clearly less than during the bum before the 2008 crisis.
Destroy, destroy
The price rise in London last summer, Olden said.
Aberdeen also began to relief his property in London, and was a net salesman last year.
There was some sort of turning expected, and now it's coming.
What about this?
It depends on how the British national economy is evolving, says Olden.
He is not afraid to judge a lot, but he says that no rise is hardly permitted.
The sense indicates that there is a lower or smooth expense in front.
The old man has seen several movements up and down since he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that the cows will survive at work.
If you're ready for the risks well, you're in a better position.
He believes in global dissemination.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of it.
If the risks have been decomposed, the risks have also been decomposed, says Oldenen.
S-group starts registering purchase information more in detail earlier
The S group knows what you are eating, because the trading group has told us that it is starting to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its customers.
As soon as information has been collected about the final amount of the fiber, the group begins to collect it as well on the products purchased in early May.
The S group will follow this Centre, as the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Centre’s Customer Register for a couple of years.
According to the CEO of K-Plus Oy, Ismo Riitala, the feedback received from the program has been mostly positive.
The product specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and is licensed to be used for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Rarely the customer has forbidden the use of product information, Riitala tells Econoussanom.
He said that Kesko would not respond to the S-Group registration change.
The centre classifies its stand-alone customers already in ten groups according to mere food supplies.
The rating is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland has no customer support program and has no such plans.
The Finnish Central Store has its own One-Bonus-bank customer program, which can be associated with in Choice Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting information about product or product group levels, we remain at the end of the fiber amount.
I mean, we know where the purchases were made in the store, and I and the customer will pay the final amount.
We haven’t gone to this level as a group of K or S, says the commercial director Anu Ora.
He believes that the customer's stand-alone program will continue to be reformed in the future, but the Middle Shop will tell this later.
However, it does not allow the registration of product information to be started.
Initially, try
So far, the SOK Customer and Customer Registry has been relatively wide.
The basic information includes not only the personal and address information, but also the profession, education, form of residence, births of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The S-Event card is stored on the date and time of purchase, location, final amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, the information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase information will begin to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismo, Home Terroes and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level.
Customers have long been hoping to be more focused on marketing, said Marjaana Saarikoski, CEO of SOK’s customer service and partner business.
The S group says it is aware of changes to its customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information in marketing.
However, the data is stored in any case, whether or not.
A desired person can check their deposited information from the website of the S Group.
For example, cats cannot access information, Saarikoski emphasizes.
Video: Heila-pentu is the latest dog reinforcement in the Customs - the pen becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador pickup will strike five similar boxes placed on the ground on the Helsinki-Vantan airport.
It does not take a long time when it sits decisively next to the middle box.
Customs officer Lassi Suntio rewards her Heila dog for playing with her favorite game.
From the box next to which Heila was sitting, there was a debris that were pushing to the rutial gas.
Ruticus gas is the first smell with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online shops
Heila is the first dog specialized in searching for weapons and explosives in Tull and will be located to work at Helsinki-Vantan airport next year.
The tasks may also be carried out by Heila and Suntion to other cross-border areas and ports.
However, the airport will become Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused customs measures, and after the attacks, the control has been confirmed, according to Customs superinspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another reason for access to the training of a gun and explosive dog in the duties of the customs are posts through Helsinki-Vantan.
With an increase in online trade, up to 40 million postal messages pass through the airport every year, including items and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, the customs duty has made the discovery of online shops in Helsinki-Van Airport, including about 300 luggage items, weapons, parts, gunfire and explosives, and their origins.
Heila will work across Helsinki-Vantata.
It will investigate registered luggage and postal shipping.
The ports will have a great benefit in the future, when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, the Customs assess whether more weapons and explosives will be trained in the future.
Groenberg is looking forward to thinking.
School in the Church
Heila-pennu training is the coordinator of the dog’s Tull School located in Kirkkonumme.
Subio will also be trained with Heila with the police and the Defence Forces experts.
Police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, the customs authorities decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Healy, we are always going to continue as needed, says Grönberg.
Helan colleagues in Helsinki-Vanta have six drug dogs in Tullin as well as money and drug dog Mass.
Labradorinducer Heila has been selected from ten dog locks.
The selection criteria for a dog chosen at the airport include racing and hunting, as well as peace, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosions and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close friend to the customs officer, but also a family member.
Nothing goes home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Beautiful commandments go to Heila from the garden.
The Sunshine cameraman loses no protection of the camera for a quick dog, but Heila restores the protection that appears to be soft toys immediately from the "hit" view.
Hard Competition of Tools
Primary training will be completed next year.
There will be further stage tests in the next October, which will assess whether training is adequate for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen in Helsinki-Vanta in the next year, if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, travellers can’t come to slide the dog on the workplaces, Suntio recalled.
The cost of one work dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their work age is about seven to eight years, even ten years after which they will be retired to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work lasts only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the tools is a hard competition.
Heila was the owner of about 20-30 customs employees.
Luckily, Suntion had no work dog before, but he had years of experience with dogs and controls in Tullis.
Mini state gets its first Olympics - people get a free day
The rugby Olympics in Fiji with less than a million residents are so high that the government has been appointed to be a national holiday on August 22th.
According to the public radio company, the Fiji government confirmed the issue after its resolution.
The free day is held by the team to return home the next day.
Heroes are also allowed to celebrate in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian says the country was followed by a final in the capital of Suva, where the stadiums were screened.
Normally only native Fijilians are interested in rugby, but this game combines our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, the game was watched, I heard their encouragement, said Fiji Times reporter Michael Seru Guardian.
Drama in Riossa - Finnish singer turns out after a terrible performance

RoPS acquires viral attacker Prosan - Operations League - Evening-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who plays in the men's football league, has concluded a lasting deal with the official attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player in our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniem is small.
With more than 10 players, we went through 50 players from all over the world.
The small group began to be a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in the newspaper.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from a rural Flora, where he made a total of 51 paintings in 109 matches.
He also played in the Estonian team.
Prosa is expected to be involved in RoPS on Saturday at the Senegal River, where the Rvaniemies meet the SJK, a Finnish master.
RoPS was in need of a new attacker when last season, the painter Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Dangerous Modern Family star again: teenagers shorts reveal almost everything
The modern Family comedy series, Alex Dunphyna, who has become acquainted with Ariel Winter, re-exhibits a threat to his arm.
Winter was depicted in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don’t leave a lot of imagination in stock.
Shorts reveal not only the foot of the actor but also this backbone.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently drawn attention by changing its style and behavior significantly more bold.
The star has posed on social media in its publications in very few images of clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing in very nude homes.
Winter on the Adults threshold has also recently published several pictures of themselves at the celebration.
If the picture doesn't appear, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In this case, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was running a "typical Hollywood transformation" from an adult child star.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
She has learned that the more she appears to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention she gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and more that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter began staying in the Moderni Family series only 11 years old.
The actor has denied some of his long-term fans in his image change.
It’s not hard to figure out where he’s in 10 years when he’s already getting so hard, a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the women’s fans are defending the actor and calling for her to be without a criticism.
You look great!
It's the same as others say.
You're inspired for many women, you're a young woman.
Japanese prefer Northland - tourists are attracted to retreat: Autumn it is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start revolts from the beginning, Visit Finland says in the newspaper.
The chiefs of the Japanese revolt competition are Inari and Levi.
Revonuts are our winter tourist cards, and they are strongly combined with heart winds and snow landscapes.
In the winter of the lap, rebound dishes are in good demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
It’s rare to know that the revolution season starts early in the autumn and continues long until the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, in which the surface of the lake reflects the revolts by making the vision of the two floors of the port, says in the newspaper Visit Finland, see marketing chief Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group of revolt campaigns are rich 25-35 years old, Japanese women living in the city who are looking for tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online ads.
According to a survey conducted by the University of Aalto and by researchers from the University of Turin and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of Japanese compared to other North countries.
However, the Japanese missed more clear unique attractions from Finland, and this retreat, according to Linda, has a huge potential.
Overnight stays for Japanese travellers have grown more in Finland.
Last year, they spent more than twice in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
As a destination group for tourism, the Japanese are interested in spending more than €80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind said.
Britain will be happy with rugby at Fid’s master’s gold course
The impressive progress in the UK’s rugby tournament broke Fidzi’s last challenge in the final Thursday, when the team experienced 43-7 losses at Deodoron stadium in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master’s course in the treatment, raids, weaponry, support games, runways and silk as he wins gold - their first Olympics.
The loss took part in a reasonable conquering of the British silver metallist for the third day, and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 win of the semi-final played earlier the same day in South Africa may have bothered them in the final.
Despite this, Fidi would have won the top 15 team.
Britain may - but probably not - comfort the fact that at least one British has a golden necklace tomorrow: Fid's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
The journey to the UK has been pretty good.
Eight years ago, as Ryan's coach, they lost each game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This spine is injured, but the development is alarming.
Fidi began greatly fighting Britain’s tactics because of the fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams were like they would be running on the roads of buses, and the world champions were driving 5-0 since Osea Kolinisau jumped into the corner of the painting area.
When the clock had four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown in the right place led to a paint trip.
12-0, and the UK had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great tabla stopped the man-berg Leone Nakarawa from making the third painting, but it was only a slower to Fid.
At seven minutes Jasa Veremalua made the painting in the right corner, and Britain was 17-0 lost.
Nakarawa made the painting again from the new initiative, and the watch remained for a minute... the first half-life.
Afterwards, Vatemo Ravou broke through the discoveries of the UK and made a painting on the line.
After the paint break, the situation was 29-0.
It seemed like Fidi had been born to play rugbya while the UK had just taught the game.
And that's what it really is.
The United Kingdom made some changes at the stop that underwent Fid’s fall for a total of four minutes, which was well compared to the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova made the painting after the influential Fid’s input game.
Dan Norton picked up the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner and climbing the situation to the numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost for Southern Islanders whose supporters sang, jumped tickets and danced in view.
It was hard not to admire Fid’s joyful approach.
Mata Viliame's last minute painting had a load in the Fid cake, which did not need load.
The pillar was celebrated, the Philistines fell down, and the UK fell down, totally blown.
The same day, Fidi had beaten Japan’s 20-5 semi-final, and Britain won a tight South Africa semi-final, where both made a single painting – the British painting would solve the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's lead on the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the painter area with a stunning footwork and made the painting under the painters on the other half.
Marcus Watson, a 15-aside rugby team from Anthony's brother, secured the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer was cleaned up by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning
In these cats there will be no feelings of more terrifying gold, and it really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 tough riots to history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper significance in the golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
The coach Robin Williams was present all the time when the two were in a consecutive Olympics in the Women's pair - the first women in the British sports history books that surpassed the many achievements.
Their control was complete, and this was the invincible of their 39th appearance, which is also recordable.
This is what we see, two great athletes connecting to the surface with a smooth smoothness, does not completely illustrate the character of victory.
In the background of each of them, there is a group of helping pairs that gradually promote things that matter. And no pair of pairs was as important as a coach, who had not known 30 months ago after receiving cancer diagnosis, to live until now.
As he said, the situation was true.
I had urinary cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut off, and they performed the surgery.
If they do not cut it, it spreads everywhere.
The situation could have been a bad thing.
It changes a bit of your thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were lucky in the fact that his treatment was able to start outside the early 2014 season, causing as little disturbance as possible - if the expression could ever be used in such situations.
I had to get a wage, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
It is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after victory, the first couple thought was Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more commonly trying to deal with his own nerves.
Stanning, a commander of the Afghan commander, said: "I have been a tunneraunio this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard Helen and Robin are, too, we have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he's a great thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t imagine a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost their competition in five years.
The couple put a hard rhythm on which their competitors did not match.
Even at the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close at a moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything special.
We were not looking for joy today, we were just trying to win a good war and a cat, and so we did.
A couple wait for a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will take part in the wedding next month when he gets married to a TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he just wants to enjoy a moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic player.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland replaces the Panama Years’ Government
In October, Iceland will organize early parliamentary elections, which are required by protesters in the Panama Information Years already in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed taxes circulated by several Icelandic politicians through tax paradise.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson divorced due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to organize new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is now decided on October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the last rage of the people affects the autumn election results.
In the presidential elections in June, the criticism of the enormous ones appeared clearly, and the president was elected outside of the policy to be conditioned by Gudni Johannesson.
Trump said he was sarcastic claiming Obama to be the founder of Isis
U.S. Republican President Donald Trump revoked his latest hardships.
He said he was sarcastic claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization and Democratic President Hillary Clinton for the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party was angry with the talks and asked for apology from Trump.
The commander of the Army should never let anyone who can walk down there, Clinton said.
The Mayor of Cannes in South France has banned the use of bulkini swimming clothes that cover Muslims’ favorites on swimming pools, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
The Mayor David Lisnard’s signature decision states that swimling on the coast and swimming is prohibited by all who do not have a good way of swimming and secularism.
The decision also states that swimming pools, which largely express religious connections, can increase the risk of order disturbances in France, which has been subject to terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds of injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old went to the French National Day for the party.
At the end of July, two extreme organizations connected to the Father attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over the age of 80.
The quality of the swimming waters of the area of Oul crosses the sea - Pyykösjärvellä bluesamentuma
The water samples taken from the official swimming pools of the Oulu area meet the quality requirements set for swimming water.
Only by the swimming pool of Pyykös Lake has been detected a blue sample.
The Oulu District Environmental Action took water samples on Tuesday and Wednesday from nine EU coasts and 30 other general swimming pools in the Oulu District area.
Except for the beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcus bacteria in all swimming waters undermined the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcus in seafood water were ensured on Wednesday, when the concentrations of bacteria were lower than the limits of action.
The blue seam detected by the swimming lake does not yet make water swimless, but under favorable circumstances the situation can quickly become a blue seam, forming the surface of the water as a blue-green flour.
Environmental action monitors the situation by the narrowed examination.
If the blue pot becomes a blue pot, it will also be informed separately in the Swimming Table.
See the results of the swimming water samples here.
MTK's Hakkara gift reduction: more than 80 % of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance next year.
The tax law proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the forest deposit generation exchange.
In the proposal by the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: promoting the generational exchanges of forest farms, youthing the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of forests and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
Forest owners would make a reduction in the net capital income of forestry.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational exchanges of forestry plants is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, director of the Central Forestry and Land-Forestry Association (MTK).
However, Hakkarin finds critical of the tax change proposal.
The reduction of forest gifts shall be submitted by the forest owner's net capital income.
It is a capital income from which all other reductions have been reduced.
According to MTK and Hakkara, the effect of tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the wood sales revenue.
In the VM's proposal, a reduction in forestry net capital revenue prevents the loss of forestry capital revenue, which should be reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would have a tax benefit even if he didn't sell a tree.
The calculation model is uncomplicated.
The average forest owner is unable to figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small portion of the forest owners.
The tax reduction limit associated with the yield value of the forest is EUR 40,000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled out of Hakkara's view to too high.
According to him, 82 percent of Finnish forest owners are dismissed from the reduction circle.
The model would have an impact of about 10% of the forest owners, he says.
In the VM, the border is considered to guarantee the goal of growing space.
Forest policy has been deducted for decades according to Hakkaraise.
In the background is the ageing of the forest ownership.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful railroad surprised the Himanga drivers - two cars jumped into their wheels and collided with each other
The fish in Himanga took a special retreat on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutive cars dropped into a wheel, after which your collision came after the time above.
According to day-to-day fire historian Harri Pythia, he is suspected of a severe burden.
In the back of the car, two people were transported to the hospital.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver wasn't injured before.
The accident occurred in the kingdom of 8 Himalayans a few kilometers away from the Fisheries.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research findings from the University of Turin can help develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings made by the Academic Professor Johanna Ivaska Group show that the severity of cancer cancer increases the malignacy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was able to prevent under laboratory conditions by restoring cancer surrounding tissue to respond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be able to improve by concentrating on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in their treatment.
The research results were published on 4 August in the journal Nature Communications valued in the field of cell biology.
The treasure of the family rape continues in the cave, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence to another prosecutor
The tree of the Much’s family house will continue in the hook for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for a family crime in Muhoks.
The other one received eight years and four months, among other things, a kidnapping and severe stealing.
The second sentence is a 12-year prison sentence for murder and severe stealing as a young person.
The person convicted was also sentenced to severe threats to transport safety as a young person and to the right to transport transport as a young person.
The prosecutor, the prosecutor, and the man who received a harder sentence were appealed for the judgment of the prosecutor.
The prosecutor calls for a young man to be sentenced to a milder punishment for murder for 12 years in prison.
Olives at the time of action in full understanding
According to the law of appeal, 17-year-olds killed the man as director of the school’s child protection unit in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was murdered attacked the executioner on the back of the living room on the sofa.
The director went out of the chamber and took the young man's room, and another young man shot him in a foam tube.
The director was also beaten, beaten and kidnapped in the head, among others.
According to a study of mind, the two convicted were in full understanding at the time of action.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from the family at least since last day.
The ice is the world’s longest backbone, growing only at the age of 156
The world’s most lively spine is a secure ice cream, a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the floating ice cream around Greenland, the holker can live up to the age of 400.
The woman grows only at the age of 156.
Ice life adds that it only grows a centimeter per year.
Only one simbolica is known to live ice cream longer.
The researchers found their age by radiocarbon limitation.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some smells had radioactive residues.
Based on this, researchers were able to evaluate the age of the disease.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years - however, the drop in the direction or in the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Visa - People's News
Donald Trump does not need to change the world.
Up to a third of all state tax revenue would be left unless Donald Trump’s property changes to corporate tax.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, with the most beneficial tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary showing it on Monday in Detroit.
The company's tax will decrease from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without collecting, it would really be a shameful amount of $1 billion a year.
The total income tax rate is now 39.6, following Trump’s reduction of 33.
The legacy tax would be totally handed over.
Trump accused the state of too much regulation in business and of driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The enacted environmental standards for disasters must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector must be dismantled.
Barack Obama’s health care reform must be taken into consideration.
The administration must designate "experts instead of bureaucratic".
“Devastating” trade policy, Trump said, is the biggest cause of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be rejected.
Imports from China would be taxed by 45 per cent and 35 per cent from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our religion, Trump declared.
Donald Trump does not need to change the world:
American cars are coming to drive on the streets, American airplanes to connect cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new clouds throughout the country.
By way of deviation, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests stopped it 14 times.
Economists - also close to Republicans - see the U.S. taking Trump's programme to deep economic growth.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program on Friday in Finland’s time.
Assassination of the past - People's News
The sea is destitute, but the real attack attacks in the middle of Madrid's streets - the account with the past can begin.
This is the core of Pedro Almodóvar’s novelty.
Almodova’s previous guidance work Travellers (2013) was a small and rush-skinned satiary comedy, preceding it in which the tops of the career of the Spanish artist live in (2011).
Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It is a perfect room for love, human relationship and family, in the center of the relationship between the mother and the daughter.
The story is a simplicity and is seen a lot of long backwards.
Life seems to be modeled with a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then all threatens to climb.
A new man (Dario Grandinetti) must always be surprised at the end of the film.
In the form of a back and long letter, Julieta once stages her life into her adult daughter.
She starts with the time before her daughter’s birth, the moment when she met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta rises to the other woman’s headquarters as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, from the TV series The Time between Ommelten (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a cake, but I myself would say that time is screaming and pronounced with a single age.
For Almodóvar films, there is always a fair distance in Juliet after so much humor.
It is uniformly played, quiet, a place in place that contains good music and a very sad movie, with such materials in its elegance.
Instead, the Spanish director has a typical visual colorfulness in stock and so it begins to put a little silence into the eye in a more pure fashion than acting as a dramatic efficiency.
People in the film experience diseases, deaths, or just sudden losses, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies in particular to the dress: in the case of a name, the residents change from stage to stage, and the same applies to the apparent earnings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing is that the motion of each stage is not particularly focused on this.
Mechanically repeating, the influence is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has made the script on the basis of three novels of the 2013 Nobel Prize awarded Canadian Alice Munro.
Novellits has been published in the work of The Witness: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in literary filtration of a slight equality.
Before that, the subjects would have been emotionally unparalleled with the drama, with a lot of big things - especially the sharp guilt - about the theme of Leffa.
Directed and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munron's three novels.
Mainly: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first day of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
New operations will not be made, the ministers will be defeated, so that the basic Finnish will not be totally broken.
However, cuts made in the spring are made on the rop.
There will be no new operations.
The estimated four billion savings are enough.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) are convinced under the budget.
It is true that the VM's proposal does not have new operations as social security operations have already been decided in the spring framework.
Children, national retirement, unemployment base and almost all other national retirement index privileges are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of unemployment in the amount of income is shortened from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Removal choices
Why are the ministers so insisting that there are no new operations on them?
The next year is the election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the main heat meter in the election, not the gallons.
First of all, it has been seen that the results of the municipality in different directions of the Government have been disrupting the state's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallups say that the Government of Central Finland is expecting a loss of smoke, although the result of its previous elections was unexpected by 12.3 per cent compared to the presidential elections.
Five years ago, the basic Finnish received 752 new authorisations, most of which will realize the price of influence in the right administration next spring.
In three directions, the lifestyle of the government of the same large party is in place that the position of the basics of the Romanians endures.
It hasn't endured, but more than half of the votes have been required by government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the visit to the party's representative group have also come to the surface.
The new operations will not come with the retoric, first of all, the fact that they will be carried out in the next year, and second attempts to soften the expected attack of the basic Finnish people.
Great operations in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Government of Sipil is still in position.
The government has set a target for the debt qualification at this election period, but the debt in the budgeting of Petteri Orpon will be taken over EUR 5.9 billion next year, or more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the election period and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt debt is not fighting or even slowed down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
This means that for the former, there will be even more tough operations in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be at least close to the balance in 2018, and then in the spring it will be accepted in the elections.
The debt in these actions does not fight.
It is absolutely clear that the debt in the current action did not fight, even if Juha Sipilä attempts to blow a positive atmosphere.
State Secretary Martti Heteeme's reports in the reporting of the budget show that it is unacceptable:
The global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. veto aid from the international economy.
The Finnish national economy has not just risen since the 2008 collapse, not only temporarily during the recovery policy exercised in the early 2010s.
The unemployment has increased by 35 percent over this decade and has been extended from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
The unemployment costs now three billion euros per year more than in 2008.
With immediate reports, the debt of the public sector, which exceeded the 60 percent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 percent in the next half of the decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the Left Alliance’s debt default was defeated because it was considered irresponsible.
The maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros next year, which is practically covered by taking a completely new debt.
This is the concept of the center, the meeting, and the basic Finnish of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that daycare, youth work and exercise are responsible for the municipality, according to the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation research.
Clearly, the majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, cultural, civil education, building supervision, high school education and waste care.
In turn, the county’s responsibility is most clearly desired by provincial assistance, special nurse care, vocational training, vocational high schools and institutional care for people with disabilities.
None of the tasks in charge of the municipalities will be transferred to the state.
The underlying railroad runs at the end of the back of the police.
A 16-year-old Joensuu driver fled a police party at Joensus Ilomantsinti on Friday at half a time.
The police party tried to stop the motorcycle running without lights, but the young man went to drive the police with a fair overspeed.
The back drive continues to the Sonkajan coast, from which it continues to the Sorronahonti and to the smaller forest, where the motorcycle went out of the road.
After that, the young man ran away, but a faster police officer ran away.
The drilling test for the driver showed 0.75 prom.
He didn’t have a driver’s license that would have been entitled to ride by a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, by a severe threat to road safety.
The rocks fell down on the ground.
The rainfall in the stone fell on Polvijärv on Kaavinti on Thursday evening at 21.15 p.m.
Rekka had been deployed on the left side of the fold out of the way and fell into the hills.
The rescue agency lifted the injured driver out of the crashes across the top of the door, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first career.
The lifting of the vehicle remained the owner of the vehicle.
From the boat, the hydraulic oil was absorbed by the rescue facility.
Police investigated the cause of the accident.
The old woman disappeared at the Air Force in the afternoon.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing from the afternoon in the Air Force in Lahdenkyl, South North.
Police are looking for about 165 centimeters long, sharp and sharp a woman with white hair under her hair.
The observations and tips on missing movements are requested to call the No. 0295440513 of the Northern Situation Centre.
Materials of the accident in the air - see the gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The tents of Parafest festivals falling in the flow caused enormous destruction.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will reach its economic footsteps, and the event can also be held next year.
The Parafest's last appearance of Kalle Salonen appeared at the end of Friday at the torilava.
The program will continue on Saturday at the presentations held in the city theater rooms from 13:00 p.m.
The Art Center in Ahjo is the Parafest Exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized planned.
The streaming occurs in the fall cloud when the rainwater and its weight start a declining air stream.
Changes in the form of water in the cloud binding heat, and thus the drop in the air will melt and its vapor to the ground will accelerate.
According to the Institute of Science, fluctuations occur in Finland during several summers.
It is difficult to predict the path of attack flows.
Attorney flow attacked the Joensu at the Joensu Museum as Parafest's event place on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly killing themselves.
Among them was one child who was transported to a seriously injured further treatment.
Air Pollution Aging The British
According to the study, the skin of London is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of aging is air pollution.
According to the British study, Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the Londonist skin of many pensioners is two-and-a-half years older than the aged friend who lives in the rural area.
Small skin-aging particles are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transportation fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londonians die every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to pass through the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those Londonians who are walking on their way to work in the vicinity of rude streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different skins, but more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleaning.
Tractor brakes were deceived - working in front of a standing man
The man had moved stones in his backdrop with a tractor.
When he left the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor brakes were fraudulent and the tractor dropped on the man.
The man didn't stay below it, but the tractor, however, dropped the working man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital for further research, being seriously injured.
The tractor couldn't move longer because it hit the stones in front of you.
Explore the newest power for the next period

Through Josban, Kataya and the Rivers to the U.S. team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all salibandi championships since 2003.
Now in Tampere, the sixth matches are already going, only in 2013, Canada has been better in North America's cars.
I was working in Turku and playing with women in the sickness when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. had set up a Salibandi country team.
I'm interested in this, and this is what I'm doing now, Jumppane, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppane went to Joensuna University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species has not yet been played at SM level as a salibandy.
The stream was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the Jokipoi Ice Cream in the SM series, Jumppane remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university the salibandy SM series from the 1991-92 season, the following three passed in Josba.
In the course of the game, he trained the A-girls in the championship.
Women's SM series was made up of silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played women in the SM series 10, with a balance in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The last SM year is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Minjanane was named for the land team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and the Eno-Original Tatu Välanan was selected for a Finnish country team that will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who was attacking in Helsinki, has played this before six men’s matches, with a total of 9+4=13 performances.
The 32-year-old Swiss Wiler-Ersigen’s defender Tatu Välananen has recovered from the travellership and is part of the standard team with an experience of 117 land matches.
The team was also named the conkari player Mika Kohonen of the Seinä River Players, who was seen in Finland last time in the last December Championships.
As the main coach of the Salibandy team, Petri Kettunen is the main coach.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasun round closes Kouvolaan - SM gold lacks a prize prize
Essi Hasu is to stop as a beach volley player at least after the season that passes temporarily.
Beach volley Finland championships will be resolved on weekends at the Kouvolan Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played in both adult and young series.
In collaboration with the Kouvolan Airballists and the Finnish Airball Association to organize the SM final tournament, the six best pairs of each series rankings are eligible.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY, grown by Essi Hasu, who has been part of Finland's beach volley tops for several years.
Today, the Hasu in Helsinki is waiting for enthusiastic games in front of the public.
Hopefully, as many as possible will be able to take a look at the weekend.
I'm sure it's going to be a great arena.
I'm not very often played in adult series in Kouvola, so it's great to play at the finals at the home corner, Hase the mood.
The cowboy mixed Hasun's painful sport and gave good eaves for a great entertainment.
In my mind, childhood is a great reminder.
When I was nine years old, I started flying in the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the mind is too big toys, knees rotating in the neck, as well as high-speed shoes and koreography after a point, Hasu remembers.
In a small area, the sport had a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's joint life created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were actively involved - the father of our teammate trained us, and our mother was the chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley has already been a natural selection of species as opposed to the indoor ball.
The swimming pool has been played by a bike since the 1990s.
Activity has always been active.
I also went to follow the junior SM tournament competitions, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this hack occurs when Hasu plays the weekend together with the SM final with the turkey Anniina Parkkise.
The goal of the second punishment in the tournament is clear after the Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahden.
As a realistic goal, we have a measure.
SM gold is still missing from a prize cabinet, Hasu throws it out of honor.
The presence of a weekend in Kouvola may be the last familiarity with Hasu in front of the public.
In early September, new challenges are expected for civil work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the reservoirs are placed on the neck at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli is a brave farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk loans, sand and wisdom.
The young farmer Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in the positive future also in the rural area.
Two years ago, Koli and her younger brother, Valtteri Kol, began to act as their continued home status.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant debt withdrawal and ordering increases so that the bread could be handed over from agriculture.
This has been from the little ones until my case.
I’ve always been happy with the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and well.
In 2013, we started to build a pineapple, and at first the bank wasn’t excited about it.
However, I really bravely joined the project, and I was fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells and adds that he would not have taken action if he had not believed in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The aim of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest in even bigger navels.
The work has resulted because Solomon Koli has been chosen among the top ten in the competition of the young food producers in the journal “The Future of the Rural Land”.
He is currently competing for possible wins.
He can be voted on the newspaper's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that the inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (from June 2012) and the first number above zero after October last year, which reported a positive 0.2%.
The annual average inflation measured by the living cost index during the last 12 months was -0.8% (September 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (September 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the living cost index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
In the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate was -0.2%, and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, economic goods and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level with alcohol and tobacco drinks, living, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's "anime" team is reviewed as Asian Catalyst
According to Snapchat, the anime has acted as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million users daily to modify the reality and to play identities that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog, or a character that suits Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
The lenses are simple, face-revolving tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All misleading steps quickly end in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized by the allegation that the app advertises a black-face mask or prefers whitened skin colors as a beauty idea.
So when Snapchat announced this week to some users a lens that gave them wine eyes, wine teeth and bubble pockets, some critics called it a racist caricature from Asian people - "gold" or yellowface.
And they wondered whether these repeated polemics could be a sign of the larger problem of the company with regard to the diversity.
The news and bad news spread widely on Wednesday with The Vergen and Motherboard reports, a day later Snapchat said they had stopped the feature.
The company offered an explanation: the lens was meant to be honored to anime meat, not to be a carikatist of Asians.
But for experienced observers of racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in operation.
Others refused the animated parable.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American artist whose tweets were widely distributed from photographs, said in his email that the lens was "at least vulnerable and uncomfortable".
He added that "it's hard to claim against the comparison with the most severe Asian script and the effects of the filter".
It shows that the filter is not only yellow, but also the yellow to the extreme degradation.
Snapchat is not the only company to overcome these cultural gains.
American culture appears to be infinite in the struggle of diversity and involvement, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all wear in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, race-based audience of younger parents can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends the user, “so many people have a lot more difficult to be unnoticed.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product leader and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In his letter to the Media and telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of Snapchat’s wage practices.
Zhu valued the company's mainly white men's leader and decided to write his article with a hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
"Whether they have no representation of different skin colors in their personality, so they are able to make such decisions," the Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors in work, but they are not in places where they would feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely without answering.
The company does not publicize numbers of its staff’s diversity, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss his staff’s racial religions, but, according to a representative, the company hired a recruitor some time ago to concentrate on the underlying populations and to advance internal integration efforts.
In his own contribution, Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed by adding, "Is it that they actually need more users like us to say that this isn't okay?"
According to Congress panel, military officials distorted Isis survey information
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress panel said that the U.S. military headquarters made a survey report on the U.S. military military headquarters to present a more optimistic picture of the war against Dads in Iraq and Syria than what happened on-site.
In the report of the Group of Defence Committee, which was established by the Republican Chairman of the Committee of Investigation and the Sub-Committee of Defence Credits, it was founded that the head of the Defence Committee was "proportionally discontented" among the ISIS analysts, who said that the presidents were trying to assess their
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces Area in Tampass, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of the survey approved by senior leaders of Centcom typically gave a more positive picture of US anti-terrorism efforts than what facts on the site justified. They were regularly more positive than the reports produced by the survey community."
"Centcom's events are impossible to accept - our fighters are suffering in the war when poor analysis is presented to high-value decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, a representative of the Republic of California.
Centcom’s leadership fails to overcome the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the underlying problems in the capital descriptions and analysis of US efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that Obama’s government’s high-value administrative authorities would have ordered reports to be decayed, it describes the feeling of analysts as if Centcom’s leaders would have put pressure on them to describe the Islamic State, the Islamic State, in a more positive light of the threat caused by it.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
Centcom’s authority, for example, publicly stated that the major attack to re-enforce Mosul could begin even as early as in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in possession of Islam.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," the representative of the Republic of the People's Republic Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the highest-valued investigative leaders of the U.S. military military headquarters manipulated the production of the capital's survey to reduce the threat of Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans, after hearing the working group that analysts had brought concerns about the manipulation of questionnaires about the Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, follows broader results in the course of the investigation.
The superinspector of the Ministry of Defense has launched an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's investigation into the information.
The Democratic Committee of the Chamber of Representatives published their findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the final conclusions of the Republican Group.
"Before 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unexpected process of disintegration of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a leader of the Committee's democrats, in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of surveys", bad mood among analysts and "not gave enough space for different perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said they did not find evidence that the White House had tried to press Centcom’s analysts to agree on their conclusion “to their own set or political story”.
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congress investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that Pentagon superinspector has launched an investigation after Centcom’s complaints of analysts.
My commentary captain Patrick Evans, the representative of Pentagon, said in a statement that the Defence Ministry would not comment on the Congress report as long as the investigation of the superinspector is underway.
But he said that "experts sometimes agree on the interpretation of complex information, and the community and the Ministry of Defence consider a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security as welcome."
The investigation has further follow-ups than just about the question of whether the U.S. bombing actions in Iraq and Syria have been successful (as the increasing number of defence authorities now claims).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama could trust the headquarters to provide honest estimates of war actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the Islamic State’s survey reflects more than a decade after controversy when Centcom’s survey analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article saying, despite the opposition to several analysts, President George W. Bush’s administration in 2003 held a small military team in Iraq, which was followed by a few years and spent very little time.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on Islamic State surveys.
The Hooker Group concluded last year that despite the opposite public statements, expressions against Islamic State governments have not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary warehouses to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this finding was not reported outside the capital.
Centcom's commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive estimate of war.
General Aust retired in April, and he became the headquarters of General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in women's land hockey, organizing an intercourse with the UK
The day after making three paint teams in Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made the first two paint teams in the U.S. country hockey team in India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five paintings in two games sound unforgettable, but the 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
“I don’t have any idea,” he said.
"I'm not really like a man who has a book about his paintings."
But he knows this: Americans are in a 4-0 Olympic tournament and they share their group's first position with Britain, which was still unfinished after Japan's 2-0 win on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet the first round in the last game on Saturday.
Both teams have survived the quarterly, and this game decides who is the first and who is the second in their six teams.
The first one is to avoid the strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, a little longer at the beginning of the quarterfinals.
Whatever Saturday is the end of the game, the Americans have woke up with their surprising success here, four years after they left the last 12 teams at the Olympics in London.
Bam was in that team.
He grew up at the Blue Bell of Pennsylvania and took off his hands for the first time at the age of 3 (he was his two-girlfriend who played species at Drexel) in connection with the land team at the age of 16 when he became the youngest player of all time.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not participate in his final game.
In 2012, nothing happened to him and his teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Culture change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We did not have the same job as we have now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday evening Bam began painting the first half-time by painting close to painting.
India had appeared to have won any wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and held the situation in 1-0 readings until the end of the third party, when Bam took over the situation.
He moved the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then traveled to the middle and swinged the ball to the American 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added four pieces in the middle of the last painting.
This zero game was the first US tournament painter to Jackie Briggs, who had released one of the first three wins in each of the tournaments.
He's in good condition.
That's the same with Bam.
"We're in a good situation now," Parnham said, but his goodness depends on the end result of the game on Saturday.
Trampoline Peace in the midst of the Olympics
Wherever you are, no matter what time you are, the Olympics are on the way.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and inevitable, angry with the message of competition and effort.
Just like the Olympic race itself would be a lightweight message bubble, transmitted from a screw shooter to a swimming pool and from a triathlonist.
It is impossible to put on television, read a newspaper, or listen to a friend's conversation in a coffee zone without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps, and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympics and the future heart killer, may well be one of the names of all who are presented at the best time and who are supported by sponsorships and well-meaning television shows - if he was a swimmer, a sniper or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley, 28-year-old from California Lake Forest, is competing for an Olympic tram.
The Olympics don’t illuminate all species as much.
As far away from the center, partially in the shade, there are species that are not all generally accepted: air conditioning, bulb, football, celekwondo.
We always have breastfeeding for a long time.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special preferences, I would like to pay attention to the trampoline's attraction force.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic race since 2000, when it made its first appearance in the Sydney Games, its presence has been so little in the past 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic player at all.
This may be regional unknownness.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won the medal, and its athlete has not advanced to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China’s Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan are defending their gold clubs in London.
Trampoline, however, involves a certain type of attraction to the defender, partly because it sounds better suited to the clown school than to the Olympics with an uncivilized ear.
I have to admit that I am not an expert, I'm just a fan of non-aircraft.
The species have the possibilities of entertaining, as you notice from the color of the endless pumps of the drawing films, but it also has the solidity of the reinforcement and swimming pool, two species that in principle combine it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a poundboard.
The championship targets jump with a gigantic trampolin up to nearly 30 feet in height, and they have to perform rigid business series (translations, tails and volts) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympics programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flying time".
32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common course of the Olympics is straight forward.
The medal wants to go looking for gold longer, faster, up and above - sometimes to paint, sometimes even back around the field.
They do not only hunt a paint line or a starting line, but also, in the TV news, a second irrational border: world or Olympic recording.
This destined goal is a leg, admirable, and even fanatic - and it can even get into the tears of the viewer.
But that’s also the reason why watching cats can be a bit relaxing.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest here.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, affecting the pressures of the astronaut, goes up, then down, then uncomfortablely up again.
Of course, this does not affect competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no angry riding towards the end, no jumps to distance, only a dreamy, sudden interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as possible in the Olympics.
Women's hot competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 13:00 (ET), men's matches will also come on Saturday at 13:00.
NBC sends the finals as part of their afternoon software from 14:00 a.m. on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic hall, they offer a quiet, exciting moment that most likely is not noticed in general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by providing male athletes to be watchable and represented (as the U.S. men's officers suggested some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for a new fan.
"The Sexual Generation Demonstrates" in Ethiopia, a long-term allied of the United States
Violence in Ethiopia
The protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced a violent opposition from the government.
The eyewitnesses say that dozens of demonstrators have been shot dead in the meetings with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong Western allied whose economy is growing rapidly.
However, during the past few months, protests against the government have been harming the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
In the last week, thousands of people have fled into the streets demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was unpleasant.
The eyewitnesses said the police shot and killed ten armed demonstrators.
The widespread, recorded videos that are believed to be at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security authorities strike young people in the same way as they were forced to stand against the wall.
The General Human Rights Authority of the United Nations now requires a transparent investigation.
"Management of this country has always been difficult, and it will continue to be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the African corner of the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most popular country in Africa, and western countries appreciate its stability.
U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and almost any African country will receive so much assistance from Western countries.
The Ethiopia economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Abeba has even a new train for travelers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organizations have continuously spoken of government affliction, the country's opposition has been restricted, and sometimes thoughts have been effectively trained.
Many have been expelled from the land, imprisoned, killed, or run away into the desert.
But this can be changing.
"If you suppress people, and they have no other choices than to show your mind, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole young man is showing his mind.
One generation shows her mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover all of the coalition that ruled from land use to the ruling power.
Last year, after many criticised elections, the ruling party with its allies became the last place to hold the opposition, and now it holds all the seats of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea rise, and the battle on the front of this rush and disputed border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less bloomed over the past few years, can try to take advantage of and re-arms.
Several factors explain why fractured emotions are now exploding after years of falling under the surface.
The first looks like a visible innocence: smartphones.
Only over the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have generalised and the Internet service has improved.
Although the government would close access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through the network’s media services that hide the location.
Many young Ethiopians said that they were meeting for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups of Ethiopia, Oromots and Amharats, will be more effective.
Oromos and amharts are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amharians, who come mostly from the Christians of Ethiopia, have succeeded in politics and business using the terms, many of which are Muslims and who live on the streets.
But this has to change as well.
“We are on the way to organize under one rainstorm,” said Mulatu Gemechu.
Most of the demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oregon regions.
Many Amhars and Oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly governed by the Tiger nation, and its people cover about six percent of the population and control arms, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason for disturbance is the loss of Meles Zenawin.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical neron, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of inadequacy and use secret ambassadors in making opponents harmless.
“The current government does not have such a basic stock,” said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was removed as relatively unknown to fill Meles’ saaps.
Unlike Meles, originating in the tiger region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam is south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by tigers are not trusted in him.
Many are afraid that this can lead to increased bleeding.
Last time, Ethiopia was under such a slaughter in 2005, when thousands of people thought to show elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have the government first defeated and then stolen them.
As a result, many demonstrators died, although less than in the past few months, and that period of discomfort passed relatively quickly.
Developing experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for the visionary infrastructure design, such as the new labour travellers, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But this has clearly not stopped the reinforcement of the internal government of Ethiopia.
And now it starts to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
In the last month, protesters in the city of Amhara in Gondar attacked tiger-owned companies, and tiger-confident anger becomes increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say protests are putting the United States and other Western allies into the position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for neighbouring flights to Somalia, although it said some time ago to close this base place.
While western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want to break the instability of their allies.
"This," Abdi said, "to a real balance."
Donald Trump Explained Obama’s Based Dad’s “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign of praise on Friday claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly said this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders of the Islamic State terrorist group."
The examination raised new questions about the ability of the Republican President to communicate clearly to the American community.
It also placed his defenders, who have been pushed to defend him during a storm period, in a difficult position where they have to explain comments that he may not necessarily mean.
Following the Wednesday’s campaign meeting, Trump argued the same in the Thursday interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
In the early Friday’s Twitter release, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation of the last day when Trump said he was really serious in several interviews.
When Conservative Radio Drinking Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump raise his attention, reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican President took this to his ears.
The last critical storm comes in a situation where Trump has strived to refocus his campaign in the midst of the results of opinion based on economic research.
Trump and Clinton struggled to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the talk was boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm defense.
Later in July, after he encountered a widespread review visiblely suggesting that Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his comments by saying "I'm sure I'm sarcastic."
The approach enables Trump to go through political speech boundaries and then return, if necessary.
"I think it is a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clearify' in a direction or in a different direction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the use of both candidates.
But I also think that he's so excited about his opinions and knows that they are insufficient enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of relieving his speech for a major vote, Trump has been increasingly sharper in recent days, after his favour has continued to count.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey on Friday showed that Trump is considerably following Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorados, and that the case is strict in Florida.
Although Trump generally seeks to avoid excuses about provocative matters in his message, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his mood.
As he faced the increasingly closer review of the presidential election campaign over the past few months, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies to a distracted position where they have to publicly support him regardless of how provocative his comments are.
New York’s former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most important supporters, saw much effort to defend his candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe that there are real political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked him about the truth about Trump’s claim, accompanied by Obama and Clinton, founded by the Islamic State.
It is true in the mind that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that he called a amateur, completely fool, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
The majority of the vast-flow Republicans argue that Obama’s government, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before Pennsylvania’s Friday meetings, Trump continued a Twitter attack on the news media, who reject every word and are partial against him.
He shouted "bad, sorry" television experts who try to get it clear, saying "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats rejected Trump’s attempt to become a new proof that he was inadequate president.
Previously closed coffee returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a dirty, only cash-acceptable place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but that offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the street circle of Bedford Avenue was too expensive.
The movement that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the form of a cupcake.
The locals denied it as the last loss in a middle-class sanitation city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is disturbed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also a re-invention.
The Revyed Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, below its original location to the main miles.
In the new Verb there is a wifi and there you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff remains the same and there is the same fantastic atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verbe is led by Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and CEO of a new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, took a lot of Asians.
Verb uses the same baggage supplier and purchases a similar espresso machine.
It even used the old Verb lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought new ingredients.
The dining list contains bean-potato beverages and coatings, for example, caprices and brown peppers.
There's brown rice in the expenses.
There is no longer beer in the coffee, but there is fresh juice.
In nine months, Rodriguez says that he has noticed old-fashioned customers.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers too," he said.
One of the last Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After she moved to Greenpoint, she walked in a coffee.
He says that after Verb's closing, he left the coffee drink for a moment.
“I realized I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to coffee couples, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
"Every day over fifteen more than seven, regularly as an hour, I went in and they were preparing tasteful bagel with salt," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to make experiments and bring new ingredients to the food list.
Today, Rosenthal is still making its ordinary order, but sometimes because of variation, he places space with a tasty baguette with pepper, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he wouldn't carry a beautiful soap shop that took over his old spaces.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherien offered to prepare Verbille’s special soap to use as an ingredient for coffee cooled.
"I think we can still get to offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint’s traditional Polish residents have also accepted coffee.
One of these new customers turned from food to Poland, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it in front of something soon to make his new neighbor feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold coffee.
It is possible that the cafe extends to the nearby building.
Many customers are enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a stand-alone customer and said he was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he had come home walking in and ordering coffee.
“I missed smell of it,” he said.
A Square Meal: Meal in the morning
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office room.
In heritage, President Roosevelt deemed perfect for the Fifth Avenue's foods, such as the bulb champion, and Maryland's protective shelter.
On that day, his meal was unnecessary: filled eggs in the tomato cabin, potato juice, and aftermath of cloth.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity to people suffering,” said Jane Ziegelman.
His husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The pair of Brooklyn Heights has food historians.
Coe's last book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about the life of the Lower East Side floor house through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the 1930s’ great season.
By demonstrating their own culinary solidarity, they meet the journalist at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unforgettable lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been operating since the 1929 stock exchange gathering.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh olive tree, and Coe, 57, took the dose with calves, potatoes and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered a meat potato, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the season.
“The worries were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was a rainbow, a liver rainbow, a liver rainbow.
They were made of a product and some poor ingredient that continued the actual preparation.
Imagine your cancer so many soaps that they will form your dinner.
Coe irvist.
"It's probably felt in the stomach from a sweater," he said.
Years before the lamb at the American tables, especially in the rural, was like a food-to-nine-to-jacket table.
Women's groups made meals for male farmers, and fresh drinks were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to Europeans who were hungry during the First World War, and the book A Square Meal chronicled habits that the nation survived that it was no longer a land of overwhelmingness.
"Then the food became a central, anxious topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One alarming was a new, affordable diet: Mystery foods, such as worries and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use foods", said Ziegelman, as cooks were able to hide less attractive ingredients under the cream box.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The muscle, which had been in the middle of American meals for years, became a savings-saving luxury product.
Special ingredients have been tested when calories and dietary levels are more important than taste or even a healthy sense in the kitchen.
In the study, Ziegelman also prepared a seasonal meal that was filled with bottles of potatoes.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman precisely said, "It was unrealistic."
The earthquake isn't suitable for swallowed beans.
This was characteristic for many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Agency in 1923-1943, have managed the country's food methods more than ever before or after.
In newspapers and magazines of public recipes and articles, they encouraged women to begin to become "budgetists" and to respond to the challenge to convert spaghetti and porch-like mushrooms into tasteful doses.
A Square Meal is a historic holiday.
Especially delicious are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat a cake’s attitude.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood simple, Yowash farming food, he ate as a fine millionaire who had become her.
"He loved continental food, like a fish with a necklace," Coe said.
She ate almost a golden smoke in her dining room.
He was great outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake, unless his wife, Eleanor, had encouraged him to be an example of his own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Ms. Roosevelt hired an economic nurse who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place "to offer not only Washington's worst but also the worst-made food."
Many of the laminate meals were rejected as soon as the land came back to its legs.
The heritage is constantly focusing on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in practice how science applies to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s meals, for example how he couldn’t throw away food.
"He was really afraid of losing food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even hurt people."
There was a wind blow.
After the tables were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe were drawn to the post-food they had prepared at home: a post-printed meal that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a sweater," Ziegelman said, adding that a general trick was to give an unrequired recipes a name that looks like.
There was no cream beans, only snow, a little wheat, sugar, water and canel.
All of them were unwillingly swallowed up their bowls, and brown into the hills.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe can't wait for you once and again.
Sounds like a positive budgetary, he told his wife: "A lot of dirty German shells could help."
Attorney costs for Gilead are replaced in the fight against hepatitis C patents against Merck
The U.S. Court of Justice has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to obtain the lawsuits incurred by a disputed drug manufacturer against Merck & Co Inc. for hepatitis C.
In June, $200 million of Gilead’s payments were released after their breach of two Merck patents associated with Sovaldi and Harvoni’s successive drugs.
In a judgment on Thursday, U.S. Arbitration Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to be freed from the compensation caused by the complaint.
Merck is trying to capture Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of drugs for hepatitis C, which can clearly heal more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The law proceeds until 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other for the ownership of the laboratory based on sofosbuvir, the active substance of Gilead medicines.
U.S.-supported forces say they have fully authorized the Manbij ruled by Isis
The U.S.-supported forces have fully authorized near the northern Manbij city of the Turkish border after the last remaining ISIS players left the city, the group's representative said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city since the last group of fighters in the city left.
The troops had liberated more than 2,000 civilian incentives that fighters thought to be prisoners, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF’s Allied Force, Manbij’s Military Council, told Reuters.
“The city is now fully in our control, but we have started to explore it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton paid $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published a 2015 tax statement showing that the revenue of Democratic Presidency and her husband in the year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax percentage was 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton gave a million dollars to charity organizations, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton realised nearly $5.3 million speaker compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million customers from his book Simon & Schuster, in which he told his career in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton’s Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax statements.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are providing aid to economic transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast to this, Donald Trump rejects false actions and revokes his previous promises of publishing his tax statements.
According to the U.S. presidents, their tax declarations are published, even though the law does not require it.
New York’s businessman Trump has betrayed the tax administration’s audit due to the refusal to publicize tax statements.
“Your face,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic Statement Tax Releases.
Trump’s Special Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican President Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his gifts of charity, his business, and numerous other links to Russia, for example.
Clinton has been arrested in the issue by publishing on Friday a online video showing visible Republicans who urge Trump to publish his tax.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every president has done for the last decade: published his tax statement," he told the public.
Politico has stated that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times business scholar loaned a number of tax agents and accountants on Friday who said the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax percentages have become a problem in the presidential elections.
According to billionaire Warren Buffet, Clinton has supported a rule that would ensure that more than one million dollars a year would pay at least 30% taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton’s meeting in Nebraska Omaha last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and change tax statements.
Buffett said he was also underway inspecting the tax administration, and that Trump was not "playing" the tax enforcement agency, but voters.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax declarations by 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was approximately 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was approximately 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax statement showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment goal was an affordable, index-related investment fund, and Clinton announced $109,000 of share and interest revenue.

Chilean powder condoms and snorkeling enhance the protection of Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unusual means to prevent nose from crushing into human habitat areas - they throw animals with chili powder-filled condoms.
Keino has proved to be effective, and the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation, which has been invented several years ago, together with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has strengthened its advertising by training volunteers in the village of North Tanzania to use four step-by-step ways of protecting homes and hundreds of animals without injuring.
In the past, many of them used to protect themselves.
Friday is the world’s Christmas Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed tools, we have observed a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more reliable in terms of being able to keep them out of their ball without harming them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeyguars.
The first two steps hold the showing of a penetrating nose with a bag sheet and the sound of a torch.
If it does not prevent the animal, it will be thrown into the so-called “chili cloud”.
The condom shall be filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil, and the condom shall be rounded afterwards so that only the welding chain will be visible.
When the condom is stitched, it blows out in the palm and sprinkles chili powder into the air.
One swelling is usually enough to send the nose to the other direction.
It's the last way to shoot a Roman candle in the air, and it's an enthusiasm that produces sound, light explosion.
RT News: A Jewish filmmaker criticized Berlin hotel that removed the Israeli target number on request of Arabs
The French-Jewish filmmaker discovered the media storm that the hotel Kempinski Bristol, located in Berlin, does not list the Israeli address number. According to the employee, this is due to the "requests of Arab customers".
The Holocaust documentary film made by Claude Lanzmann dismissed his distortion in Berlin’s hotel Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During the recent night Lanzmann tried to find the country's list of destinations offered by the hotel in Israel.
However, the land is not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and washed?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker took the question at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer was received from there "healed him".
The hotel’s receptionist said it was “the decision considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels”.
The reason behind the decision was even more shocked by the filmmaker.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they require the removal of the Israeli direction number,” the employee said.
Israel’s German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case “a great mistake,” said Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
“We were scared and shocked because of the case.
It is already a big mistake in itself.
But even more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We are waiting for the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident produced a fairly counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel simply "repeated" the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Have you," said the second publication, noting that the hotel in the beautiful Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly objected to all charges and called the event "unobserved" as well as "apologies" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“A clear command to not include Israel in the quick-election list has never been made,” said the representative of Kempins, Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used tears and rubber products against Brazilian students.
Students joined the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when they met to demonstrate the reforms of the government’s public education system.
Police used tears and rubber products against demonstrators.
The problems began when law enforcement attempted to break down the student team, which led to the police using rubber products and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their fear of plans.
According to Paul Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, fewer than 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some participants in the demonstration saw writing temporary graphs against President Michel Temer on the walls.
This last demonstration took place only days after the protesters left the movement as a group to support the detained president Dilma Rousseffi in the vote of the Senate for his office.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases 71%
After the withdrawal of sanctions, trade trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70,9 percent compared to last year, Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan said.
After the international sanctions against Iran left, Russian companies have demonstrated their interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran’s bilateral cooperation is to expand trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period in 2015, totaling $856 million.
Russia’s exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to a total of $697 million.
Russia’s imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
"The growth of trade was achieved by the delivery of machines, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects the number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office in Iran issued Iranian citizens about 35,000 visa mainly for travel.
Iran was also the first one among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
“It seems safe to say that last year’s records of Iranian tourists in Russia will be breached,” he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians are visiting Iran, which the ambassador wants to change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shirazin and Yazd. They have kept monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotch Callum Skinner Painted in British Bicycle Racing
The Scottish Callum Skinner honored men at the Rion cycling stadium last night, when a third of the UK team defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in a role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy was rebuilt, and the legend was proud of the young man, when this took off the paint with the predecessor of New Zealand's win.
Britain took a shock winning four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth at his sixth Olympics.
And they repeated the tempest, unreliablely positioned as the sixth March in the London World Championships, although Hoy has decided to compete afterwards.
The problem between Beijing and London has been replaced by special ambassador Jamie Staff.
This could be done just at the time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from which British coaches were caught in regards to the Scottish potential that is now perceived.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoyn four years ago - and Skinner made the Olympic recording at times, but New Zealand took the lead on the first round.
And the British three won a double gold fight.
Hindes was definitely behind after his own round, but Kenny kicked the team's head, and Skinner held it.
The strategy change was a major part of the change, and it included Hindes’ driving with a larger variation to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to the will.
Hoy followed his role as a BBC expert, paying Skinner, Kenny and Hindes attention to their awards.
23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said, “The comparison is immortal.”
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made a final Olympic record and won the world championships.
It was simply incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012, Kenny and Hoyn, Hindes admitted that he had intentionally fallen on the road after a bad start.
He later returned his comments and did not complain from British competitors.
This time there was no similar problem with the overpowered win.
Hindes said, "It seemed to have been in London when there were so many British-British tickets on the foot."
We and the team have found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so wining the Olympics again is simply great.
One event, one golden toll for the people, won seven of a total of ten types of bicycles in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to be successful for five days at the cycling stadium.
On the basis of Kenny's condition, it's not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's birthday, winning the three Olympics in one Olympics.
This would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23th (as seen on the holy day of the British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), would increase the total number of miles to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoyla.
Kenny will compete in the next sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I just enjoy this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
We won it together with our friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold talents, he should give him the value of the rider."
This was the only medal competition for the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were at times the fastest four-speed, four-kilometer-speed team.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 golden world record is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second competition day, and Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time, when the officials called him to measure the length.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Milgavia Katie Archibald are going forward at the world record time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great rail bike team will take possession of the midfield of the Olympics and reach a whole range of miles.
When presented in Beijing and London with truly exceptional and complete management, expectations have been reduced before the Rion kiss.
There has been a drama in the background, which has not been the least of the technical manager Shane Suton, the difference in April due to sexism and hate, as well as the ending of the competition of majors, such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the competitions of the first night at the bicycle stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of the UK now can rise to its top at the perfect moment may once again be considered true.
The future of Portland's unclear question due to cutting of electricity agreement
The future of Portland’s Victorian aluminum system, as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs, is uncertain when the electricity distribution company reveals that one of the factory owners is ending the distribution agreement, so it is expected to cut all distribution agreements.
The measure follows the decision of the Victorian administration earlier this year that the aid required to operate in the factory will not be continued.
The aid period for a period of 20 years ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be in danger at the Alcoan Portland factory.
Up to 2000 jobs can be in danger, directly or indirectly, with the closing of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the swelling uses approximately 10% of Victoria's entire electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's solitude, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoan Portland's defeat loses money and is under a shutdown.
The action now follows the speculation of the future of the factory for several years, which has begun as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been led by the production price of the factory.
AGL, who distributes electricity to a large aluminum hall in Latrobe Valley with Loy Yang An's power plant, said it also expects three other owners to decide their agreement.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are owned by smaller shares.
"AGL expects the operation of Portland's factory to continue, which means that unfilled physical electricity needs will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "defence agreements", which had to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month withdrawal period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"For this reason, AGL expects the outcome of the agreements for the financial year 2017," the electrical company said.
All possible impacts on AGL for the 2018 financial year are currently limited by the strong future views of the wholesale prices of electricity.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounting by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the agreements "does not affect the ability of Alcoa ... to keep a swelling in operation or to safeguard uncontained electricity".
The U.S. company said it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement had to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it was withdrawn from the agreement.
The analysts have been reserved for both Portland’s salt in Victoria and the Tomago factory close to Newcastle, as the economic situation in the industry is weak.
Earlier in the week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland used about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago 900 megawatts.
"If both factories leave the market, there is a significant reduction in the demand for the market.
As a producer of electricity, this wouldn’t be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just Kardashian real TV star, is in the middle of September Voguen
Kendall Jenner, 20-year-old, model and mother manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is the U.S. Voguen's desired September number.
Kendall, a brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and modeled in Milan, Paris and New York, announced news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"Looking at this car in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The public was followed by a colorful (or perhaps only Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and involving all of the favorite entertainment, Keeping Up's films, Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's turns, but they also finished.
It’s a clinic story of almost every child’s television series “birthday” (Seacrest expresses the quotes “you probably thought we would forget you” in the morning’s credibility), but Krisina had to get the other girls somehow to benefit from this public.
This is because we have definitely moved to the new Kardashian period with the location of Vogue in September.
Kendall's grandfather Kim may have first taken Vogue's complaint (he shared her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the number of September magazines is quite its own class.
Vogue’s September number is the most selling pressure throughout the year.
Its thickness resembles more coffee protocols than fashion magazines, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion declined that last year’s 832-page tutorial 615 was advertising content).
The revelation of its national stars is expected so firmly that the pictures of the newspaper over the past two years have been swallowed before its official publication.
Previous women have been in the position of Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has actually been more "publics that act as models" than "models that are famous".
Oscar winner and Dior Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in position in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if Jenner, which the magazine describes his generation’s “success model,” first refers to the mentioned category, he’s pretty good with him.
These celebrities are not famous people's relatives or realities or today's young people who are able to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are reasonably talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year, Beyonce’s national team has been one of the strongest years in her career with Lemonade’s publication.
Not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
His real television history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world, will always be a bit of trouble.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, valued Jenner and this colleague Gigi Hadidia, calling them "the most important moment".
This feeling came back to the surface with Jenner’s Vogue.
But inconvenience is unfair to rotate.
Kendall Jenner is in Voguen's September number.
He is a supermodel in the most pure meaning of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup.
She and all her sister will sell pictures to you in their own, in their applications found behind the wall.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she took to the LOVE magazine.
And in his leisure time, possibly only to see his sister Kourtnetta and his children, he is a real TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160,000 people away annually
More than 160 000 people are turning away from Community legal centres annually when the sector is preparing for the impact of additional financing operations on its already ready-made operations.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the opportunity to fight unfair marriages and similar - are already turned away from their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already undertaken to the Community's borders are preparing for additional cuts.
In June of the next year, these legal centres have to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Community Legal Centres in Queensland, said that, according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are now translated annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not cancelled, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centers of the Queensland Community are chronicly under-financing, which means that thousands of people are turning away from the essential services they need each year," he said.
People departing from violent relationships with uncontrollable and fraudulent debtors, families at home, unfairly separated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not need help.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the center of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and the Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately revoke these financial cuts so that people can receive their need for assistance in their legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State made its pledge to raise legal assistance to the national average level.
Now is the time to consider the needs of the Community's legal centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczu government should also invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged to justice after employees were allegedly threatened with weapons
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged for the fact that they did nothing after they were told that the campaign’s head of North Carolina’s operations threatened the workers to weapon in February when they traveled in Jeep.
The incident was described by former state-owned software coach Vincent Bordin's campaign on Wednesday in Charlotte's State Court.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months for the situation to be treated internally before he realized that "it shouldn't happen."
Commander Earl Phillip “shown the piston, put the right front finger on the move, and threw the pigeon against Vincent’s knees,” Bordini said in the case.
When chosen for local and regional campsites, Bordini heard that at least four other people had a similar experience with Phillip.
"Weapons don't need to be thrown out to cause damage," Bordini said in a complaint.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican President was angry when he told the public in North Carolina that "the people of a second addition" - generally considered arms owners and armsmen - could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton was appealed and chosen by judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had removed his word from the connection, and that he did not support violence.
Bordin’s challenge requires compensation from the campaign for careless control, as well as Phillip’s violence, abuse, and emotional disturbance.
Trump’s representative, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to the comment request.
The efforts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotessa, has recently reported Phillip's departure of the campaign.
The call request submitted to his advisory company to Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
Republican President Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.

Britain has to channel the life of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings the restoration and flora to the whole of the country, not only to local communities and across London.
It was Heathrow's great attraction to myself, just as it was also the attraction of London 2012 cats, when we saw a huge effort to ensure that all our people and regions benefit from cats.
The Olympics gained enormous benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only 10 000 new workplaces and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities, and youth unemployment will be removed around the airport.
Like before London’s 2012 kisses, some think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready to fight and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong with Heathrow.
The obstacles must always be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is asked to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project for many, not only for few.
The enlargement has the opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and an economic growth of £211 billion, leaving the legacy of skills and employment around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented 11 billion pounds in the time and budget of the infrastructure investment programme: from T5, which has been voted as the world's best airport terminal in the next year, from T2, which was built between the two most busy in the world.
Now the team is ready to carry out the third tournament, supported by £16 billion private money.
London’s 2012 Olympics were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that Heathrow’s extension is also.
It is time for us to channel the lives of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, to ensure the future of our trade and to create a legacy of skills and employment, which Britain may be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and Mouse to prevent advertising
For businesses who get money from online advertising, companies pass advertising blocking programs are "knock and mouse games," one of the companies that produce such programs said.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced it would block advertisers on their computer-usable websites, Adblock Plus published a blog post that said users could update the program’s filters to prevent advertising on social networking pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its website code will be exchanged around advertisements to make advertisers more difficult to find out which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's turning the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock’s representative Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of fighting between an open-source advertising community and its tournaments has been running since the prevention of advertisements was invented,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon invent its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has participated in the struggle is a strong evidence of how much distress the advertisers have become for the industry.
About 200 million advertisers worldwide use advertising blockers, according to Pagefair and Adobe’s research last year, which is almost four-like the amount that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertisements.
However, the company is behind the advertisement blockers on computer pages, as mobile advertisement blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps on social networks or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer developments are still bringing enough income to make Facebook consider such an action worth investing.
Facebook also said Tuesday it would update its "advertising discussion" tool to give people more power in terms of how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worried because they would also block some of the site’s other than advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to deal with the problem," the Facebook representative said in a statement.
Advertising blockers are boring tools for which we have focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman stayed under the Swiss motorway due to suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman stayed on the highway under several cars on Thursday early hours in a case apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and settled in a dark place to sleep on a road where she hit several cars, the police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several trucks, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers related to the event have already been interrogated, but not all have been identified yet, the police told them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to sign up.
The crime investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genevelle.
“We can see if any of the drivers are accused.
Was it possible to avoid collision?
It will be resolved by the prosecutor,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that the drivers are not liable.
In both cases - in which both were a person walking on a dark highway - were estimated that drivers could not expect to meet a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, said the newspaper.
Last year, the police were released from alleged deaths due to negligence after he was reported and murdered by a man who was sitting on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old was drunk and had a break on the road, was told to the court.
The court found that the police who had been responding to an emergency call were running in a reasonable manner, and that the man’s location on the road was “a totally exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the case on Thursday near Morges should call police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA’s climate model: Venus once lived
According to NASA’s new climate system, Venus is likely to have lived once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed the model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the heat, waterlessness of its surface and carbon dioxide filling to its air may sometimes be soil-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotating speed of Venus explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that Russia could have been a thin, earthy atmosphere, and it could still have been slowly wheeled.
The model also examined the early Venus surface formation.
The planet probably had dryer areas on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to enable life and quickly protect water from decomposition.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30% more brighter than the sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its sunlight for almost two months at a time," GISS's researcher Anthony Del Genio said in the news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud that acts as a rainbow protecting the surface from high sun heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are in fact a few degrees cooler than the current Earth.
The model produced a story from the stages of Venus development, which is similar to what planet researchers had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably sometimes living, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet for several billion years.
Its oceans collapsed and its water vapors burned in an ultraviolet cell.
When it escaped, there was only a thick carbon dioxide that remained to the deadly greenhouse gas phenomenon - Venus, which we now know.
The researchers shared the results in the new Venice air-conditioned Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanchen coach’s pest
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from Colorado Avalanchen’s coach and vice-chair of ice affairs as a reason for the lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Colorado’s Vice-Deputy Director and Chief Executive Officer, confirmed the information and stated that the team will immediately start searching for a new coach.
“During the past three years, I have made my duty as Deputy Chairman and Chief Coach for Ice Affairs Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” said Roy, 50-year-old.
I have been thinking for a long time during the summer and hardly about how I could improve this team to give it the depth needed and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and deputy Chief of Icelandic Affairs must be fully lined with the view of the organization.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for this contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything that he has done for the organization, and we hope that he will be happy in the future.
Roy was named the best Jack Adams Award winner of the League for the first Avalanchen season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the victory of the central division, but Minnesota fell on the first round of Colorado's fall, and the team did not continue in the last two years.
The Avalanchen games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 matches, and the team lost for Wild by five points, losing the western conference wild card defeat place.
The Hall of Fame's chosen painter Roy won four Stanley Cupia - two in Montreal and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue to negotiate and delay
The struggles with oil workers in the North Sea are delayed because of the salary, when all the parties of the party are sitting down for a new negotiation cycle, the leading negotiators said.
The oil field service company against Wood Group has been randomly organized by Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT allies can confirm that we have agreed to restart a process aimed at achieving a solution to the current challenge," he said in a joint statement.
In the next few weeks, we will hold a number of meetings all day from early next week to take a fresh look at the problem.
According to professional associations, their recent workfighting, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, was an opposition to possible, up to 30% wage crashes.
This year, the Wood Group cut the prizes for North Sea workers by about 9 per cent due to negative market pressure.
The company's wages decline follows a 10% reduction in its employees in the countries since 2014.
The company said that the additional cuts would provide the company with the decreasing ratio of the market in the mobility market necessary.
Shell, in turn, has hired thousands of people from his wages and has announced its plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as the company relieves its operations as a result of its gigantic fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies have pressure on the lower prices of raw oil, and this economic situation is worse than Britain's monthly decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish parliamentary Dave Anderson meets allied leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest businesses of the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need a economy that works for many, not only for few, both in the North Sea and throughout the country," he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleadia
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete list of the rotational speeds of the Plejadian Stars.
The new information helps astronomers understand why the stars of the stars are rotating at varied speeds and how tour times are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star groups, we now learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age, and even the history of the sunset," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Center in a press release.
The Pleadien Stars team is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
Now they're rotating at the top level.
At its high speed, these grown stars rise in large amounts of stars.
When these winds pass through the magnetic signs of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star gets older, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of detectable stars, such as sunlights.
The list of the latest star rotating speeds indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, larger of which make piruses slower than smaller.
"In the ballet, we see that the slow wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejadien star team is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory to assess the characteristics of the stars at rotating speeds.
"The Plejadian star team offers an anchor to theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so-called "dance" in the corner.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotating speeds of Plejadi in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
