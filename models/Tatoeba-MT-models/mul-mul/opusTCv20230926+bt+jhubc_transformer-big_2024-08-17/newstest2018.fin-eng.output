Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, diagnosed as a mental sick, and now she makes art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
From the roof of the Project Room Gallery, dozens of patient reports are scattered.
Each of them read Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how foreigners have written up their interpretation of Auer and its identity.
He decided who he was.
“I wanted to tell a person my delicate care history to make the violence of the process visible,” Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a year-long research period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts by sending "gender identity disorder" diagnostic studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Before that, he had used an estrogen that he ordered on the internet and was still very long in his own repair process.
He experienced being a woman, but according to the Finnish law, a person must pass through the correction process so that gender can also be legally corrected.
Translaw, i.e. the transsek law on the strengthening of the gender of Suala (563/2002), obliges transgender people to be forced to sterilize, in order to obtain the right gender, for example, to the population register center and passports.
At present, the corrective of each gender is required for psychiatric diagnosis and proof of inability to reproduce.
Man has the right to decide on his own body.
“This situation is intolerant and violates human rights,” Auer says.
The translain has been reformed in Finland for a long time.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has issued eight comments on the law, and in the European Court of Human Rights there is a preliminary ruling which obliges the Parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with self-determination.
The former Finnish government prepared the change of the law under the leadership of then social and health minister Susanne Huovise.
The elections were fired and the Persians rose to the government.
Now, the legislation is still underway.
These are internal political disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to raise it to the table because there are disputes in the government about the change of law,” says Frank Johansson, CEO of the Amnesty Department of Finland.
The front of the exhibition is controlled by two large installations.
Another of them consists of the packages and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient reporting facility, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the Auer psychologist of the Transpol of the University of Tampere Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and on the basis of this, wrote a report to define Auer’s right of treatment and help.
The consciousness of the reality of study appears to be exposed to horrifying.
The concept of study itself appears to be in a cross-border manner and the instability of personality is emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
“It was shocked to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental sick,” Auer says.
It was even more shocked when Auer was not granted a sexual harassment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not enough to start the process.
He was forbidden by his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer went out of the meeting and dropped the transpole to the house of the television waiting room.
Later, the artwork was created from the television called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and use of it.
“It’s crazy that any man who is born as a woman can increase his breasts, but to remove the breasts, he needs a diagnosis,” Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you try to be other than the number of your gender defined in birth.
The experience of Auer is not the only one in its quality.
Gender correction is harder for many mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Its passages meet dozens of people who must justify their own existence and have the right to their own sex experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are rejected by the treatment, causing their resources to be not enough,” Auer says.
Many processes have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible trial experiences.
The medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be started.
“Prevening treatment and aid can cause a person to be even worse than it was before the process began,” Auer says.
Auer’s own exhibition also addresses anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
Auer writes: “I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adulthood and that’s what people are usually hard to mix.”
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer began using hormones, the feeling was made easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and adolescence.
That’s why the wide membrane didn’t feel suitable for its body and why the breast muscles should be round instead of the flat breast.
The most important thing to Auer was that there are people near her to see her.
Being an example is a basic need.
“We must justify so much by speaking, dressing, using the voice and moving,” he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing his future, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the nearby random comments could be a lot of harm.
The most hurtful thing is when close relatives are missexual.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they don't agree or be able to internalize it," he continued.
However, all transhumans do not need physical changes.
They do not suffer from choreosisphoria, i.e. body conflict, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long-term research process can not be obtained official confirmation for your own gender.
“There is no medical basis for these studies,” Auer says.
And that's true.
For example, in Denmark, Parliament adopted a new procedure for legal recognition in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on self-determination rights with regard to legal sex.
A full-year-old applicant shall submit a written application for a new identity, stating that he has experienced a second gender.
After a half-month review, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the ministry shall grant the applicant a new identity.
This self-determination is also required for Finland, and this requirement is also made up of Auer’s exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for an artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection.
I would like to believe that the art still has the weight and that it can bring about political changes during which politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization issued a Travel Warning to Missouri
The national NAACP has issued a travel warning on Missouri, which is the reason for the state's discriminatory practices and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Report on Missouri will enter into force on 28.8.2017, and it invites African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to observe extreme caution while travelling in a state in which a number of controversial racial events have recently occurred."
The law that came into force recently in Missouri makes it more difficult to export cases of discrimination, and the implementation of state laws is disproportionately targeted by minorities. According to NAACP, these aspects led to the issue of a travel warning.
"People's rights are broken.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin colors and harmful or murdered,” NAACP Missouri President Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never heard of the same number of cases in a short period of time.”
The Missouri Travel Information is the first warning for the State of the United States of America.
The organization mentioned racist comments against African American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man, from Tennessee.
Sanders died in question earlier this year, he was driving through the state when his car ended with fuel, and Missouri's police arrested him, even though he wasn't charged with crime.
The travel report also referred to a Missouri Justice Minister's investigation that the police would stop the black driver by 75% more likely than the white.
“The purpose of the travel report is to call people to be in custody and to warn their family, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People must be prepared, for example, by taking into account money for payment of guarantees or by telling their relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in Missouri, in 2015, a hundred hate were recorded, i.e. sixteen most of the United States.
Travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult to challenge businesses in entering justice and discrimination in employment relations.
The ACLU, guaranteed by the Constitutional Act, recently issued travel alerts to Texas and Arizona after they have adopted immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people from immigration crimes.
Usually travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are related to other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Top: Lintilä asked Finnair for an extra retirement of the Executive Director
The State Ownership Minister Mika Lintilä (center) has asked Finnair for an investigation into the additional pension fee from the CEO of the airline, Pekka Vauramo.
It is in contradiction with the state’s declaration of will.
This week, an additional pension of EUR 130 000 rose when Helsinki’s words were reported on the award-winning developments of leading stock exchange companies.
Finland’s Kuvalehti reports on Vauramo’s additional retirement in February.
Finnair said she resigned for additional pensions in 2013.
The state has said that no additional pensions are used to be rewarded.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the last year's principle of ownership.
Penalties stopped speeches immediately.
Some time ago, the relationships between the United States and Russia seemed to be on the way from cold to warm.
At the G20 meeting in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin seemed to be the next step.
Later, the mood has been very cold.
The U.S. Congress approved last week and Trump’s signature on Wednesday, a strong response to the new economic packages in Russia.
To date, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedevilt has heard that Trump’s punishment law means “complete trade war”.
Although Russian reactions would only refer to political retorics as overthrows and overthrows, the crash between the United States and Russia is the fact that a short month after Trump’s election is short.
In the United States, the penalty law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
However, the Congress adopted the law with a significant unanimity, but the adoption of the law to the President was considerably harder.
Trump recently criticized the signing of the law for “a significant lack.”
President Trump’s fault has been the cause, in particular, of Russia, although the adoption of a law that restricts its own rights has also had to be opposed.
As well known, in the United States, we will investigate both the potential involvement of Russia in presidential elections and the connections of Trump’s campaign to Russia.
The crash between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of ruin.
When the staff of the White House has changed to a narrow and different Scandinavian turns have been revealed to be almost updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is made in the United States not under the leadership of the president but despite the president.
Such a situation is in no way unexpected.
If the Russian-relationship is a quimigrant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to the economic packages, the excited security situation in the core area of the Union also stresses relations.
The EU has clearly highlighted the situation of Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has remained at least on the top of its Russian policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For Finland, a lot of trades with Russia in a Member State, the economic packages have been a real riot.
The effects of the U.S. sanctions law are still unclear.
The EU is afraid that sanctions will make many European companies more difficult.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and potentially the Fennopower nuclear power plant project.
The acidity in Europe has led to the lack of sanctions, for example, of the U.S. economy, which is important to the U.S. economy.
Trade packages are a way in world policy to demonstrate bad disappointment.
However, the economic packages must be very carefully and carefully underneath.
Otherwise, it is easy to harm more than benefit.
Isn't anything sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House now has a Freedom Pattaya
The absence of stomachs is certainly a sign of power change.
Americans know it as well as others: Iraqis collapsed with American soldiers at the opening of Firdos in 2003 with Saddam Hussein's paste.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's chief ideologists, knew well what was going on in a sharp debate with Jim Acosta, the CNN channel, which was subject to the Miller's attack in a vocabulary that addressed the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really appreciate herself.
If he had done so, he would have attacked enormous shelters of the organizers of the crosses and characters imitating the Past of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the significance of a patch, and especially the fact that in 1903, his patch was added to Emma Lazar’s rubber – 17 years after the patch was completed.
Miller said, "I don't want to go into history now, but the Freedom Patch is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The runo was added later, and it is not part of the original Freedom Pact."
Miller wasn't wrong, but it's not just about history, as he said.
Essentially, the words touching Lazarus are the only quality in which the state not only invites immigrants, but also "the poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses wanting to breathe free, / The wretched refusal of your theme shore."
Runo is now more up-to-date than ever.
Miller did not even practice literary criticism, but he made it clear that "the poorest" are not welcome to Trump in the United States.
Discussion on the importance of Freedom is part of a broader political and cultural discussion on the importance of the United States.
Lazaro's friends were campaigning after his death for the rest of his legs, and they knew that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of Patsa was to express the relations of the French and American Republic in a classical reference image, a female body of freedom.
Lazarus changed his significance: in his story, the woman is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives her a new name: the mother of the kidnapped.
Attaching the story to the imagination was a brilliant feminist revolution and a devastating attack on the American nationality idea.
Lazarus changed the significance of the paste, and the truth has long been trying to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh, a director who can now be regarded as some kind of prophecy about Trump, said in 2010 that the Freedom Pact is not to be invited to anyone, but is the early pioneer of new conservatives who leads the United States’ spoil of darkness to hide the world: “Lady Liberty is coming out of the world.
He brings freedom from the United States to another world.
Sophia doesn’t show the way to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of freedom depends entirely on the viewpoint.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted, but hopefully immigrants on board the ship after a long and experiencing journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for a better life.
His Freedom Patch comforts him by giving hope and welcoming him.
Miller and Trump do not want it in any way.
Their sorrow does not show the way, but the lights of anger, their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK country team
Eidh Doyle remembers the time when only two shots arrived in the British country team
Neil Black, the British General Sports Union’s leader, said that 16 Scottish team members participating in the world championships are “a significant confirmation”.
The record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Championships in London on Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland, “something special is happening,” about which the UK’s public sport must be learned.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to explore it for so long that we understand what the question is,” Black says.
"I met with the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the activity of the Institute.
The Scottish General Sports Association once again believes that it is related to the operation of the union,
and the British General Sports Union believes that it is behind their actions.
And the ordinary streetman thinks he must have something to do with it.
But there’s something really great, which is due to it.”
Many Scottish athletes are competing in London with serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre run.
"Eilidh is unfaithful.
His captain's speech was incredibly wonderful," Black says.
“Athletes have left the opportunity with pride in their achievements and are strongly motivated, regardless of where they are going to live and practice.
In the words of Ellijah there was real feeling and passion for sports.”
Eilidh Doyle is a silver metalist of the National Community Championships at 400 meters, and these are his five world championships. He believes it is "unbelievable" that the country team has 16 scots.
The previous record was seven years in 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records over the course of the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 meters in London, and he is also worth paying attention: the man has an excellent season behind, including wins in the British Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when the only Scotch in addition to him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the land team says he is "a huge pride" because there are so many scots, some of which are really competing for the finals and medals.
“The access to the captain is a great honour, but even more particularly because the team members voted for the captain,” Doyle says.
“I am very proud of all Scots who came to the team.
It shows how far we've reached.
They are involved in grateful sportsmen competing for prizes.
Captain's speech?
I think it went well.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have home flowers.
It is important to enjoy the support of the homework and the fact that we are again at the Olympics.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will become amazing.”
Stop reviewers on Facebook: Don’t set up a public office if you don’t endure criticism
My father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to appreciate him from all possible domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism is certainly irritated,
But he didn’t quiet his critics.
“If freedom of speech is removed, we can be led as foolish and silent as sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
We'll get to Maryland's governor Larry Hogani, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook site and blocked their speakers.
The U.S. Union of Civil Rights challenged Hogan's right earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge unreasonable, and the attitude was also reluctant online.
“What does it matter? It’s just Facebook,” many commented.
But this matter is important,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the incredibly popular Republican governor of the Democratic state.
He has received the second best estimate of his work among the 50 governors.
Hoga is not sensitive to the heat.
He has steadfastly led the state and has strictly kept the principles.
He has also known to use Facebook as the main contact channel of his voters, and has published a picture of the chemotherapy to reach.
Therefore, preventing users coming to the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor’s page is a public and official forum that its staff maintains with tax assets.
Hogan’s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor to act in his interview with Washington Post, saying it was only about moderating comments.
Nevertheless, closing commentators into trolleys, smugglers or haters is too easy to solve.
Washington Post interviewed Hogan’s Facebook users.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk with their chosen leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, remarkable and critical.
The pastor leaned the Bible in his comments; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowies was not hostile but asked about hatemakers.
"I am extremely disappointed that Hogan has not taken a standpoint on hateful and other recent news," he wrote in a Washington Post news statement.
“I can’t also accept that when more people comment the same thing, they are immediately regarded as an organized group and rejected as a large group of concerned citizens.”
The gubernator's staff called comments "a focused attack." Someone else could call them to promote important matters.
In the Facebook era, it is easy to manage communication by blocking a reviewer or by deleting a critical comment.
Before the old man had to send staff to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical writings, or to detain and calm demonstrators.
In fact, it is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of complaining about Facebook and other social media channels.
Trump’s Twitter users have questioned him in court.
The first major decision was made in Virginia last week.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris, the government of Loudou County broke the first addition of the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Union of Civil Rights was discussing with Kentucky’s Republican Governor Matt Bevin on Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At Washington’s time, cheap postal charges had the same effect as today on the Internet.
The number of magazines was fourfold from 1776 to 1800, and nominated writers mocked Washington.
There were trolls at that time.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in Washington’s decisions.
The President's petitions to the office were reviewed by the Jay Agreement, namely the Co-operation, Trade and Maritime Agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, which appears in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
But he did not quiet his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of speech and freedom of discussion are the fundamentals of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this.
Summer feeding for birds should be stopped immediately.
Samples have come from about ten places, and in addition, online announcements about couples, three.
Most of them have become South and Varsinus Finland, but then also individuals from the Haapwater and the Senegal River, a special researcher from Marja Isomursu Evira says.
The vegetables have died of tricomonosis in the lighting pathology.
It is caused by a scientist called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has already been known to the attackers, especially for decades.
In the 20th century, however, the disease was also detected by peippolins.
In 2009, it was very good.
Then the tricomonosis caused a large collapse in Finland’s green pepper pocket, after which the species’ positions had been recovered.
Sick green peppers have now been, but at least not even largely, the Museum of Natural Science Museum (Creation) at the University of Helsinki tells Juha Honkala.
It is terrifying that the previous epidemic of greenhouses will recur again, unless anything is done.
What to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop the bird’s summer feeding immediately.
More about this later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of the home show at Renaissance Club
Former European single player Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of the home field for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotion will host the 25th Scotland Senior Open tournament.
Last year, the Northern Irelandist Rafferty led a tournament held before the last round at the Archerfield Links field last year, but finally lost for Paul Eales. Rafferty is pleased to take a new place and serves as the embassy of the tournament on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full brilliance,” Rafferty says.
"The players see the best of the field. It's in great condition.
Jerry has done great work with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he's proud of his achievements here.
The tournament has a great performance for this field.”
The English Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won his 32-year-old career for both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels a special occasion," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my win in Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tournament this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come back in mind: the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time to remember.”
Gary Orr returns to real action on her own soil, leaving the tour for 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Gaming at home is always more commonly relevant,” says Orr, living in Helensburg.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and played a lot strongly.
I am pleased with my game so far.”
The three will be accompanied by the former Masters winner Ian Woosnamin and senior major tournaments Paul Broadhurstin, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNultyn.
The tournament is attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Parking will cost five pounds if the car is only a driver and ten pounds if the car is at least two people.

Casharm's potential internal air problems were solved safely
At least no internal air problems have been found in the safer Pori pricate's message company, the pricate was reported on Thursday.
Indoor non-examinations will continue.
Surveys began when a man who had stopped his health care was considering his health was weakened because of the poor inside air.
According to Lieutenant Lieutenant Mika Holman, the Chief Pricate in Pori, there were no problems in the health situation of other craftsmen.
It was apparent that there was an individual case, and there were no health problems for other servants in that unit.
Each notification is taken seriously and we wanted to explain this fundamentally.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, Holma says.
The Pricate report says that due to the arrival of July, the goods have had to be transferred to the casarmas, which has caused a rapid increase in dust.
The air has been able to make it look like it's dirty, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use a meal in the kitchen.
He rarely uses the cat.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Panai region, located in the Indonesian resting province of Pope. When he prepares dinner, he typically puts a potato – locally a “note” – directly to his fireplace.
After half an hour, the backed potato is eaten smoothly, unwashed by hands.
Dege's home doesn't have furniture. He sits on a mutated painting, where he usually also treats his daily ascaves, such as the close washing salt in the soaked water.
The shop office delivers a roofed bucket in the room.
Degei is the youngest of his husband's four wives, and he has no fields to be treated.
Diversity is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, and a lot of drinks must be taken into account.
“No one is afraid to walk in the village after five tonight,” Degei says.
This is a rare crash on the ark of the Pope, in the former Dutch border, which was joined in Indonesia in 1969. The previous controversial referendum, where 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of men's troops.
The local independence movement, opposed to the power of the Netherlands, quickly turned his anger to the government of Jakarta, which holds the region tightly in its control and prevents the access to foreign journalists and human rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is a separate and cockroach. The journey there starts for an hour and a half flight from the province’s capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues to be stomach with a five-hour drive in the drive of a rental car.
There is no public transportation here.
Around 19,000 inhabitants of the city have wooden houses surrounded by bamboo, with wavelengths made of the food to watch brown.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, without talking about journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, the Pope Mee Pago people worshiped the Uga Tamee god.
Other changes have happened.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. "He means a colorful, hand-shaped, dark shade, and bright brush.
"Before we had only a sheet of papers to cover our guards."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia. 28 percent of its population live below the poverty line, and child mortality and inability to read are the highest in Asia.
It is also an Indonesian gold.
Paniai is a New Jersey top area with 153,000 inhabitants. Only a hundred miles away from Pania is Grasberg, the world’s largest and most profitable golden plant. It is owned by Freeport McMoran company, home to Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mining produced $3.1 billion of gold and copper to Freeport.
In addition, Papu has an estimated $78 billion wooden stock.
However, these riches bring evil to the population, as they mean the depressing presence of the strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military local units between 1998 and 2004.
The Pope’s requirements for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are deprived of mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Pope, tortured and imprisoned thousands since 1969.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass murders in the 1970s in the upwards of the Papuan tribes received the measurement of people murder.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people at peaceful demonstrations.
In the 2016 We Will Lose Everything’s report of the Brisbane Archaemist’s 2016 report, reports on the brutalities of the previous year, such as executions without justice, torture — rape and electronic strikes — are particularly popular means of attacks against peaceful protests.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of Austrians because there are cases per week,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The russians have been crushed when the wild resources of the Papuan attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but their population is changing as Indonesian people from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Suluway move Muslims to the region in the hope of better execution.
Java’s warung foods sell chicken and gado-gado vegetables in the soil potato.
Locals are hard to compete.
"The converters have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the ground cheaper than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who originated in Pania and moved to the province's capital after work.
“Local women lost their customers.”
In 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo promised to intervene in the 2014 election campaign of Pope’s injustice and human rights violations.
The Pope consists of 29 regions, and this former wooden rabbit won a vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, on its way to the presidency of Jakarta.
But only a little has turned into Papu, and the locals feel that they have become deceived.
“Our friends were disrupted because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our desires and restore justice,” You said.
The panics were tested some kind of wavelength only two months after the October officials of Jokow.
Eleven children were singing Christmas tables at Enarotal on the 7th of December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on the motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use driving lights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Teba, the man returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, the drunk soldiers arrested the children and treated them badly on the ground floor.
So one soldier shot the kids.
One of the 16-year-olds, Yulianus Yeimo, was a kidnapper to come to a coma as a result of an injury.
A few hours later, the building of the state election committee located near the event was fired, and the next day it began to happen.
Around a thousand Popeians – young men and women and children – gathered to the football field to demand the right before the local police station and the military command center.
They included hunting for celebrations, and they began to present the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago family, where they were dancing in a circle and tracking bird songs.
Some of the demonstrators began to stone police and army buildings.
When the mood was hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds do more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on the TIME magazine's view of an official document that was not published in local media.
The 56-year-old Yeremias Kayame, the resident director of the Kego Koto area, opened his hands and asked the crowd to calm down and return home.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot at the left side," she told the TIME magazine in a bright colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the shot came from the lines of the soldiers.
"A few shots were shot at the storm."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times and his cousin saw shootings.
"I ran to him and assured him that it was really him," said John TIME to the newspaper, "as many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The priest’s police officer Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only “protecting” the police station because it was the object of the attack.
“We must defend when people threaten to kill us,” Police Officer Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"So it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The death toll was filed to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi held a emotional speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed his participation to the families of the victims and promised that the Pope would be treated with violence.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it will never happen like that again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations of human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to withdraw his speech immediately.
"Much of the crimes happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The main thing is that we have decided to investigate violations, but it requires certain processes,” he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he did not intend to start investigations on Papu.
“Everything will be investigated in court,” he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of "crime against humanity". Crimes relate to more than a thousand deaths in the blood vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told the TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations of the Papue have already been investigated, including the events of Panian.
The families of the victims of Panian are disobedient to the claims.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” John says.
"I'm tired of this."
He tells us that he’s still alive in fear, even though it’s been happening for years.
“Yes, I’m afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid the army's gonna arrest me, I'm afraid I'm gonna be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panicians are not afraid to talk about the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had hurt him when he helped burie four of the victims.
“The soldiers are looking for me in their hands after the burial of the victims,” he says.
The shots aren't over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring area of Panai in Deiya.
One died and 17 injured in the interference between the villagers and the leader of the building company, which began when the leader refused to take a man lost consciousness to the hospital.
A 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been forced to catch water while fishing on the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers preferred to show up in the construction field before the company's office.
Police said the villagers were stoned by police who responded with warnings.
According to locals, the Indonesian Police Police Movement Unit, however, opened a fire against a crowd, where one villager was killed.
"We're scared. We're afraid of tiredness," says Dominggu Badii, a 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and saw when wounded were brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyaan Parliament has asked for kidnapped police officers to take responsibility and move a police unit out of the area.
The panic has always been a problem with the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the middle-altitudes of the Pope.
Many have joined the Pope Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Pope by random attacks and the kidnapping of Indonesian troops.
Some of the OPM leaders are pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to its rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "security of national sovereignty".
Some of the detained will never come back.
Among the Popeans, Paniai is known as a "distressed, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is only a little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals,
Like bread.
People grow their own food: mostly potatoes and some fruit and leaves vegetables.
Growing is a woman’s work, and one woman’s responsibility may be four or five potatoes.
Most of the houses are for the family, and the rest are sold on the tower.
Ten potatoes cost only Rs 10,000 (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in the performance of locals and converters have increased, and the number of converters has increased since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabir.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to locals for better trained and richer converters.
Only a few papulists have enough capital and skills to rotate their own company competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, President of the Panyan Tribal Council.
The Syrian Papua remains a little focused on the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international news are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papoulou, although they had been granted a rare description. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Deputy Chief Executive Officer Phelim, Asian Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not held his electoral permissions and has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by abolition of news restrictions.
“Reporters from Indonesia’s easternest provinces in Pope and West Pope have new risks: visa rejection and black listing,” Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is pressured only by the neighbours of the Paphos.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – invited the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “numeral and widespread violations” of the Pope, including the shotgun of Panian.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Pope’s liberation movement.
Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir contested the accusations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with press freedom, so it would be difficult to cover evidence of human rights violations."
The locals want the governments of external powers to be missing.
When the official delegation of the Dutch human rights ambassador Kees Van Baarin visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke silence and expressed their desire to freedom, says the unnominated permanent source participating in the meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections in 2019, but the Pope says they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been contaminated with the shot of Panya,” said the president of the tribal council Gobai.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panics: they live under the power of an unexpected and unforeseen army, in lack of poverty, practically without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, the Panicians, like other Pope, hold the voices given to Jokow as a "debt" that must be paid back.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and fears, the victims of the shotgun, Panai, once again, demonstrated the opposite of one of the victims, buried one of the police stations and the military offices to the opposite country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Yacobus says in pressure.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora rejects Robert Helen's Renewal: "Even my own fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran were scheduled to be held in Hartwall Arena on May 27.
However, the match was revoked for commercial reasons.
Chisora is excited in an IFL TV interview as a cause for the flop of the renewal fight to the entire Hellenic charts.
My match in Finland floppad, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him take up because he's sad, Chisora is boring.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The new match’s ticket sales sounded up, and its promotor Nisse Sauerland told the evening of May that the match was moved in autumn.
There was no new part of the match.
However, resignation will no longer harm Chisora.
The match would probably have been cancelled in any case after Chisora had been ill.
On Thursday, three days before the game, I woke up with severe pain.
My turret was exploding.
The hospital said I had to cut, Chisora told me.
Britti says she’s currently in a 45 percent state.
He is not interested in the renewal of Helena, but in Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss for Whytelle in December.
Fire to Repeat the Torch Cloud Transmitter in Dubai
On Friday, the Lieks had the world’s highest locked residential building in Dubai, and hundreds of inhabitants had to escape from a 79-story building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building, whose name seems to be Torch, coupled.
The building was emptyed, and no one was known to have been injured. The cause of the fire had no idea immediately after the incident.
“We were asleep and awakened to the voice of the fire alarm and to the shouts of people.
“We run down the streets from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,” said George’s resident Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, the fire was dismantled at four in the morning and remained cooled.
The government reported that it had arranged accommodation to those who had left their home.
The case can revise questions about the safety of materials used on the outside of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch Building Management Board conducted a study showing that the most damaged discs used to be defeated and isolated by the public.
In the UK, the police believe that the London Grenfell Tower’s isolation and dishes could contribute to the rapid progress of the lights in a fire shooting that killed 80 people in June.
The park was stolen during the night by the mopo.
The parking lot was stolen from the rivers from mopo on Tuesday at 21:00 to mid-week at 5:00.
Mopo disappeared from Ninive to Tikkamäentie 2.
Mopo was named Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in its color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air travellers take the aircraft forbidden items, a survey reveals
A survey for air travelers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had consciously or unknownly exported prohibited objects to aircraft, and that at least six percent of passengers had no knives or other objects equipped with roads.
Less than one percent reported that they had only arrived afterwards to know that they had failed to carry weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The question was answered by more than a thousand passengers, and was implemented by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to respect other rules.
The TSA's rules consciously violated 19,7 per cent of passengers were representatives of the Y-generation and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X-generation.
Most commonly, the rules were violated by transporting food and liquids to the plane.
More than 3% of them admitted consciously to the aircraft of objects equipped with terrain, as well as 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported consciously to the aircraft of prohibited drugs.
The inquiry was attended by passengers from all over the United States. The inquiry conducted by the company wanted to find out how many were exporting secrecy goods wrongly through security checks and how many were done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most passengers are likely to carry secret transport goods through security checks – consciously or unknownly.
But, as the company made the query, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Travellers often don’t know what liquids to carry on the plane and how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of the TSA rear loads are liquids.
For some time there was also the idea that the airplane shouldn’t bring books.
Liquids can be transported to domestic flights but not to international flights.
U.S. Environment Agency Director Scott Pruitt rounded his decision to delay Obama’s decisions to reduce emissions during the season
On the day after 15 states had challenged the law of Scott Pruitt, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s head, Pruitt revoked his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions that would reduce emissions during Obama’s administration.
According to Pruitt, the change indicates that the agency under his leadership will better take account of the needs of decision-makers responsible for environmental matters in the state.
Pruitt did not mention an argument against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeal.
Member States should begin to comply with the level of ozone of 2015 as of 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would move the implementation of the decisions a year forward so that his agency would have more time to be familiar with the plan because the agency "does not want to intervene in local decision-making or harm economic growth".
Pruitt was a general prosecutor in Oklahoma, before President Donald Trump appointed him as the head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
After his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly attempted to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed to the chemical industry and fossil fuels.
The sudden change of mind in mid-week is the last relief of Pruitt's plan to relieve the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Petition Court, located in Washington, issued a decision that the director of the EPA exceeded its mandate when trying to delay the implementation of Obama’s administration’s decision, which required companies to monitor and reduce meta-years.
In its Wednesday evening opinion, Pruitt argued that, as regards the ozone provisions of its full translation, it would only strengthen the cooperation of the EPA with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then waited for activists and others to challenge the right to reach an agreement on schedule," Pruitt said.
“We don’t believe in the regulations that take place through trials and we take seriously the deadlines.
We also seriously take the regulation on our activities and the Finnish powers."
However, the EPA’s opinion noted that Pruitt could continue to use “the powers to delay the execution of decisions and other legal powers” to ensure that the provisions are “justified and based on the best available information”.
The Republicans will undertake a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The last month legal initiative aims to delay the implementation of 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
This week, the EPA's federal consortium, led by the state-run union, has said that the group intends to continue pressure.
“The EPA’s change of mind is a significant gain for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to direct influences of smoke in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the office included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Earth's ozone occurs when, for example, emissions of cars, power plants, oil productions and chemical factories react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This can cause severe respiratory difficulties for sensitive human groups, which is also the cause of thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists enjoyed Pruitt’s surprising shift in direction.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make a man like our breathing eyes use a healthy sense,” says Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must fight against Trump’s administration, because its ideological goal is to act under the conditions of pollutants and other groups who have their own interests.”
Supercar manufacturers are coming street rainforest - "events in the style of Ferrari"
It also plans to bet on hybrid sports cars while striving to hold its exclusive station.
This is likely to happen, but it is happening in Ferrari's style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said plans on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be disclosed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News news news.
All cases of the same type of virus in East Savannah
The rabbit of the beach is the same type of virus as the previous cases in East Savannah, THL reports.
The Laboratory for Virology of the Institute of Health and Welfare has ensured on Thursday that the 5th Eastern Sao Paulo is the same virus base with previous infections.
The THL has ensured that a sealing person on the beach confirmed on Friday, July 28, is the same type of virus as the previous cases in East Sabha.
Based on this information, all infections found in East Savo are related to the first, in the region found in June.
The news is good, because it means that we haven't seen other types of cowboys.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth sick may be seen until mid-August, and the epidemic has not yet expired, says Dr. Mirkaleena Erkkilä, who is responsible for Soster's basic healthcare infections.
There have been no new accidents or suspicions after the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is also important for everyone to take care of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä reminds.
More on: Three new mushroom infections were secured in Pirkanma - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for a licensed shield
Pontia's cooking was not even thought to be lazy.
Based on the basis that the process produces wine in addition to methanol that is toxic.
Preparing a chicken at home is legal next year, but not even considering the legalization of the pontick cheese.
The sheet is manufactured by the bulbs, the pocket again by distillation.
On the basis of the destilation regulation, the process produces wine in addition to the methanol that is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the Ponticle’s chain as a human right, the government’s ministry Ismo Assumption of the Ministry of Social and Health commented.
When the ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the destillation of the point was not considered to be legal.
It is also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberation of distillation, MP Outi Mäkelä (Kok.) noted.
He is in the negotiating group of representatives of the Governments, which took the stand for the reform of the alcohol law.
The permit for distillation of the point at home cannot be granted in the future even for an application.
Commercial production also remains licensed.
Intake tells us that the home preparation of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol should be prepared at home by drinking.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make it at home.
The government wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements of flavors and aromas and allows the production of the glass, the accuracy of the mosquito.
The preparation must also be made so that the taste and flavour substances generated or occurred during their visit are clearly detectable in drinking.
According to the new law, drinks can be made as much as they want, and they can give their own alcohol as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be sold.
The work of the kidney is no longer a public health problem in Finland, the bringing believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports were released from Estonia and other EU countries.
75% of alcohol in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The proposal for alcohol is now to be reviewed by the Ministry of Justice.
Alcohol law will be processed as soon as the session begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law shall enter into force in early 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It’s as if the government had already taken a stand, the city would be happy.
Oscar Pistorius was thanked for the arrest of armed guards in the hospital
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast diseases, was grateful to the South African hospital for heart attacks.
The Pistorius has already gone out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is sentenced to prison in Atteridgeville.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken out of prison to the hospital, as the guards who were armed this morning.
Pistorius suffered from breast cancers, but he left the hospital in the afternoon.
The prison officer confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for investigations.
The reporter of the Pistorius family said that the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the six-fold paralympic goldenist for six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literated telephone discussions reveal Trump’s pressure on Mexico’s construction of border walls
The letters of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have been posted to Washington Post.
Trump invited Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in a telephone conversation on January 27, 2017 to stop his public speech on the fact that he is not going to pay the proposed border wall.
The U.S. President called Nieto for the publicly pushing the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promised to build a wall on the U.S. South Coast at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and a sharp speech exchange was held during the call.
Trump told Turnbull that the treaty that the United States would take refugees on the way to Australia would have to "build", "boat" and "type". According to Trump, the negotiated treaty during Obama's period would have to look like "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped calling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the day."
Georgian bloodshed: Activists rebound in the hope of the right of racist lynching
The Ford Mercury brand car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver, four armed men break the road before the car gets on the bridge.
The leader of the army, a middle-aged man dressed in railroads, takes a deep breath from his sugar and triggers through the windglass.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man screamed.
"Come out of the car!"
The cries break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-release that was presented on 22.7.2017.
Nevertheless, the abductions of the poisoning are true when the bulb is blown in the "Roger" neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford bridge to re-assemble 1946 events, and then Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom, George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been accused of murder.
“It’s embarrassing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though killers live among us and many have to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in recharge arrangements.
“It’s a shameful thing in history, but above all it’s a burden that pushes our soul.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congress representative.
It also reminds the residents of Monroe that the error has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to be in court. We want things to be finally completed, and we want to recover sadness and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make an agreement until we get justice."
The scientist covers the dead body of the victim in Georgia's bloodshed 27 July 1994.
According to NBC's reports, more than 50 men from Monroe and its surrounding districts were suspected of lynching.
No one was accused of murder.
Although the guilty have been free for decades, activists say the motives of lynching have always been in local knowledge: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Blacks of the state of Georgia received the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The highest right adopted its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the time of the election, an incident occurred when the black farmer Roger Malcom dropped the white landlord Barnett Hester in the battle, apparently touching Malcom's wife Dorothya.
According to Brooks, the city was urged that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to FBI, influential white landlord Loy Harrison paid Malcom's $600 warranties against which he was released from prison.
When Malcom and Dorothy traveled home, their cousins were Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It has been apparent that Harrison's order and ordered murders," the FBI report said.
"It is also evident that there was a union between the state and the local authorities, who participated in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks expresses this more intensely.
“It was a vote murder,” he said.
"They were killed because the black people were told that it would happen to them if they intend to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing Georgia's blood relapse for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and captivating, and it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe in the missing current United States.
It is difficult to look at the presentation, but it is even more difficult to look at what Greene says is intended.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we have to face our own dark side,” the director said.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or don't want to hear what I have to experience."
This year’s performance began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen black and twenty white – gathered to hear Greenen’s routine presentation summary.
Wade Marbaugh is Green's Deputy Director.
He has been presenting the local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the re-release for years, but the role has always been as difficult and contradictory.
"It's a dirty feeling because I'm not my own," Marbaugh says.
“It is important, however, that this part of history be held on display so that it will never be repeated again.”
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom screams and shouts to Hester, and he's angry with the fact that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear? I told you to leave my country, n---u!"
Rascona, that is, Hester.
Then he's going to shoot.
And then all (almost all black actors) are laughing.
Greene laughs at the most.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's upset.
“Did I get too hard?” he asks.
"No," Greene's shaking.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n--u at that time."
"So," another black actor confirms.
"It's a slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room is powered by a guy.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the presentation, they want to respect the memories they have killed.
The meeting starts from the start.
Now Rascon's words are shaking.
Nobody laughs.
The rebuild ends rapidly and violently.
Shouting, crashes, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black cemetery stands next to the bodies and sings the Billie Holidayn Strange Fruit chapter.
His voice spreads at each other’s point.
A few meters away, thirty-five spectators wash their eyes with sands and tears.
Almost half of the level of the public is black and half white.
Among them, there is a couple who has come to see the presentation of Ithaca from the state of New York, but most are locals.
They have visited Brook's guide on the graves of the victims in Georgia's heavy moisture.
The killers have turned into the truth of the story, and the fame in the place of the event is hard.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children are eager to look at lifebloods and unmovable bodies and crash each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy is like reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the audience.
The actors showing the lyrics shook their references and washed tears.
Bradshaw defeats Marbaugh, a man represented by the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona takes two actresses and then explodes in the tears after a hard show.
“It’s okay,” the woman was encouraged in the show.
"We know you're not her.
You did this for good reason."
Later, the audience and actors will meet for a common dinner.
The white couple who came from the beginning talks sharply about the presentation with the black couple that he had just met.
Denise Duplinsk is hard to find words when she describes the excited feelings of the presentation.
“It’s hard to hear awful words and look at the terrible things people say and make like you – just because they look like you,” he says.
"My presentation made me notice that the lynches are still happening," he added. "They are just called arrested."
On the other side of the room, Brooks remembers the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning the next year’s presentation.
"Renovation is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors of our experiences, but it is also a learning experience," Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t take it to learn.
Those who don’t know their history are condemned to repeat it.”
Growing plants in stores scares: by removing this amount of "additional parts" will actually save
Is it permitted to remove flowers in the store before weighing?
And what about taking off the big hat out of the ananas, isn't that how much it pushes?
Answers shatter the opinions strongly: to one, it is an indication of the behavior of the extreme, while others don’t want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they don’t use and yet go home to the wheat.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, the K-Citymarket’s K-City Market of Herbs in Helsinki finds a large number of cartilage boxes, for example, the flower boxes are removed.
From the box, papers are brought to the bio waste.
According to the news published by the economic names, the necklace of vegetables is surprised by traders.
But how much extra vegetables to remove before weighing really saves money?
How important is it really about a cloudy boat?
We Women tested how the price changes when taking leaves or posters from ananas, spacious artists, flavors, bastard and flowers.
The cost of a flower bottle of €2.10 was €1.80 when all leaves were removed from it.
Ananas: the price of a total ananas paying €2.30 up to €1.95 when it turned off.
Latvian fee: the price of EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short-term position was cut off.
Aromas: Two aromas paid a total of 75 cents.
There were 60 cents for the price without the cars.
The middle size of the ball is paying €1 and without carrying 80 cents.
Final result: If the leaves and sticks go out to shake off, you will save a dozen cents for one of the best vegetables.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell up to 20%.
These purchases would have saved a total of €1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - brass star concluded a five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian actor Neymar has signed a five-year deal with the French football player PSG, the news agency AFP says.
Earlier Thursday evening, Neymar’s representatives had paid a €222 million outstanding prize for the FC Barcelona player in the Spanish League.
The sum of transfers of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which paid last summer €105 million to French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League braked the transfer earlier Thursday when it rejected the first payment company by Neymar representatives.
According to the rules of the League, the company may not pay the exit price directly to the seller, but the player must purchase his own contract out, which takes place by recycling money through the League.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who delivered the money through the Barcelona League.
Neymar is believed to arrive on Friday in Paris.
He will be presented to a new home house at the opening of the PSG season against Amiensia on Saturday.
Uefa explores details
In addition, Barcelona reported that it provided information on the payment of the European Football Union Uefalle so that the union could determine the possible disciplines resulting from the case.
Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, is suspected of violating the PSG’s financial use of Uefa’s economic fairness rules.
Uefa can be punished for a loss of over EUR 30 million in three years.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic status.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the monitoring economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG can sell several players with significant sums, Uefasta has been informed.

Austin, 21, got rain burning from a salad strike - the friction was recorded in the airport's security camera
Austin Dunn was taking ordinary workouts on the plane at the International Airport of Lounge-Florida with a couple of employees when suddenly a rainfall hit the plane from the sky.
The power of Salaman was thrown into the land of Dunn near the wings of the machine.
Dunn was hurryed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns around his body.
My father called me and told me that his brother got an electrical shot and he's in the hospital.
I just wondered if he was alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't wait for that.
It's traumatic to everyone, Autumn tells me.
According to the airport representative, the Salamarsky Warning System was at the time of the case and the transportation itself decides whether it follows.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and rebuilds business by cutting shares
The British education group Pearson announced on Friday that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut its share by 72 per cent when it started the new structural programme in response to pressures on its business operations.
According to CEO John Fallon, the reduction in jobs is mainly done at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced 4,000 jobs in the context of previous structural arrangements.
Pearson again announced its cost cut by £300 million in May as part of its third savings programme, aimed at restoring rapid digitalization as a result of a weakened business.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share from the Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would like to view the year before it was expected. Its turnover increased by percentage in the early half of the year and was £2.05 billion.
Attack in Kabul: NATO soldier died in suicide
The suicide bomber attacked a military attack in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, according to officials, a NATO soldier and several others were injured in the attack.
According to NATO, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to uncertain local data, three civilians died in a attack in Kabul's Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and 30 people were killed in an explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
Two people died on Monday in the attack of a suicide bomber in the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion occurred on Thursday night when the joint party of the NATO and Afghanistan Army became the subject of a "person carrying a self-explosion" attack.
The statement stated that the status of all injured was stable and they were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to writers, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the early half of 2017, 20% of which were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing area in Kabul, where mainly Shia Muslims live.
The Taliban said he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May in the center of Kabul, more than 150 people died in a bombing strike, which was the most devastating attack by the militant group after the U.S.-led troops hit the Taliban power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the instability of Afghanistan when President Donald Trump considers whether the United States sends more troops to the country to help local army and police.
According to writers, suicides in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly weakened people's confidence in the government, in politics, and in particular in President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA rounds its decision on delaying the implementation of smoking regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA rounded its decision to delay the implementation of decisions made during Obama’s administration on the day after 15 States had challenged the Agency’s justice.
According to the Agency, the EPA announced the implementation of the so-called "ozone definitions" in its 2015 decision late Wednesday.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to meet the needs of the states," CEO Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced that the Agency intends to delay the implementation of ozone definitions for one year in October 2018. According to the definitions, the level of smoke is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with more strict air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency challenged the court, mainly, the 15 state ruled by Democrats, including District of Columbia, which said it was illegal to delay execution.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to mitigate Barack Obama’s early environmental regulations, saying that measures are part of a broader economic growth programme.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmental advocates who are worried about the health impact of increased emissions.
According to the EPA websites, without breathing ozone “can weaken the functioning of the lungs and increase the respiratory symptoms,” such as as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person who belonged to the leads of ISIS was also sending the bomb building parts to Sydney.
The suspects said the bomb was intended to be transported on July 15, but the company stopped before security checks.
Police don’t tell you why the company stopped.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas-separating device and export the device to a public place, for example, to a public transportation device.
The Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police prisons on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will also be continued.
Liquid Director: Renewable fuels have failed well
The oil producer Nestee’s result before taxes decreased, but hit forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company made good results in oil products, the volume of sales of renewable products increased to the record level and the growth of marketing & services segment’s business profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable business gains improved the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit tax reduction.
According to Lievose, the revenue of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, although the tax reduction ended.
The implementation of our strategy is going well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we will be able to complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discussed the possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a match course to the most interesting tournament in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 pounds, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel stores in Los Angeles, until WBC's unwinnable light series champion Mikey Garcia walked along the hillside to greet the WBO's top top series champion.
Garcia won at Showtime on Saturday with Adrien Broner's unanimous decision of the former four-grade world champion, since Garcia and Lomatchenko have been among the top five of the top-grade winners on a comparable list.
Garcia stretched his right hand and asked, “How are you going, master?
Good luck in the game!"
Lomatšenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel on Saturday.
When a couple posed for photographers, the manager of Holidays Egis Klimas noted that the match between men would be “perfect in terms of size.”
"I'm a former Hughes Serial," Garcia recalled.
"I passed the series above [63.5 pounds] for the Bron, but I'm not so big.
I'm a small 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lighthouse.
He's got to rise up to the milk sheet [61.2 pounds]. Then we can take it.
That's what our fans wish.
They will be fulfilled with their wishes."
The holidays agreed.
"The necklace needs this game."
Climas asked whether the match should be organized on a payment channel. It is part of his strategy for Holidayshenko, according to which Holidayshenko debuted in the summer series later this year and will take up Garcia (37–0, 30 matches) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in meeting in the Forum as a match between Jorge Lbs and Luke Camp.
"The game could be on a payment channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that she was ready to take on a channel that offers the best award package.
“We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else will pay as much attention.
It's right for me as soon as I get the deal."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomatchenko as "unfaithful captive" and maybe plans to go to watch the match on Saturday.
The holiday stopped Garcia's swelling in the valley and said that this three-weight-class champion from Riverside seemed "truly slow, sorry, Mike... but you needed it to get rid of it."
Garcia said she was focused on showing the strike force first, and then on strike.
The men said they felt that the match between them wanted to be more and more stronger.
“This is the game we are expecting.
None of the other matches will draw as much attention and interest.
“I’m definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
She said she was expecting to come to take the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It’s going to be a great match.”
Average wage 5 300 euros, training what happens - the situation of investment funding was "villy and free"
The quality of investment has been talked a lot recently.
Lastly, Helsinki’s words told Ritva, 68, to whom the banking facility’s investors spoke full bowl of investment products for sale.
The rules for the sale of investment funds and various investment products will rise strictly at the beginning of next year.
The funds are based on the new Financial Market Directive, which will be applied in the beginning of the next year.
Currently, the assessment of the expertise of investors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define knowledge requirements.
The Financial (FA) industry itself recommends that the investment services perform its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The finance sector has authorized the organisation of APV investment studies for a company named Oy, whose degree group is sitting in both the Financial Supervision (Fiva), universities and industry experts.
The studies have a range of 12-15 points, and their tests are prepared by Aalto EE, which provides Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides mobile management development services.
Its websites say that in general, both tests are “somewhat broad in terms of requirements”.
The study material includes 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
APV investment studies at Oy CEO Markku Savikko report that the percentage of the tests is severely estimated by about 70.
In the majority of the staff of the largest banks, all investment services provided have either APV1 or APV2 degrees, as they are compulsory under the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller banking movements without mentioning the names whose staff affects the mapping degrees, Savikko says.
According to him, such banking movements are "modifications".
According to Saviko, the APV1 study has been conducted by 13,000 to 14,000 people since 2000, and more demanding APV2 studies are recommended for aid workers.
Some bank transfers consider the benefit of graduation.
Several other sectors have significantly more strict knowledge requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Recommendation requires APV examinations, since the knowledge related to the investment area is ensured at that time.
According to the statistical centre, the financial and investment assistants will increase on average several thousand euros per month, including the commissions, nature and income scores.
The average period of monthly salary is about EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in the tasks increase the amount of EUR 5,900 per month, and women over EUR 4,500, respectively.
The tenths of the highest roads deserve an average of approximately 8100 euros.
The tenth of the most skilled men deserve more than €9,000 per month or more, the tenth of the most skilled women earn €6,400 or more.
Investment withdrawal under the Investment Services Act may be granted only by a licensed company.
Up until now, the staff and task level has relied on self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit received individual cases where the expertise and competence of the investors were insufficient on the basis of the advisor’s activities.
As a vendor of investment products, you can also act in principle, although professional skills and qualifications are at a slight level.
In this context, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have significantly more strict knowledge requirements, Savikko notes.
According to Saviko, since the beginning of the next year, the new Financial Market Directive (MiFID II) will be strengthened.
It requires that each company is responsible for the fact that the staff providing investment services is sufficiently skilled.
In turn, financial supervision has the powers to determine what to know.
Marko Hovi, market supervisor of Fiva, says that one of the clear changes to the current is the legislation on the requirements for the expertise and experience of investors and investors.
According to Hov, the new requirements concern both the personnel of investment firms and stakeholders who sell products for a company.
Hovi says that, according to a proposal given by the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva has the powers to designate knowledge and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided on these views in the coming autumn.
The company will also continue to take care of the necessary training and, where appropriate, follow-up and supplementary training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has the obligation to demonstrate that this is also done.
Hovi clarifies that in practice, for example, the company must map the staff operations at individual level.
This will certainly be a different level of requirements depending on whether it is an investment plan or the sale of products.
According to Hov, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced, if knowledge or experience is not at an adequate level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain time.
According to Hov, with the change, the rules are crushed and concretized.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be rigorous at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner traveler plane "picked" a giant aircraft to the United States
The plane’s route was drawn over the United States on the service of Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with the 787 Dreamliner aircraft, testing the durability of the Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane departing from Seattle flew in 18 hours and 1 minute a 15,700 kilometer journey, which is longer than any permanent commercial route in the world.
The flight stayed all the time within the US borders.
It was flying through 17 states.
Imatran beach schools do not rain or sunrise - Iines Kaikkonen Polish shine with the help of the swimming pool
Beautiful Kaikkone's progress with good speed, Taina Itkonen followed.
The Imatran coastal schools were in Liette and Lempuka this week and next week.
Although from time to time rain and then again, young swimmers are not moxic, the body is attracted by the swimming schools Taina Itkonen.
At this week’s swimming school, there are a total of 13 children, a dozen in the next week.
The number of children in the next week was the effect that school and championship started at the time, Ikonen said.
The Imatra Beach School is organized in cooperation by Ligikunta to combine the project with the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, Liette's swimming pool had a pleasant atmosphere.
The sun and young swim schools trained to stay on the surface with swimming pools, somebody already without.
The younger sisters also enjoyed the water.
Beautiful Kaiko, five, first thought deeper into the water.
She then encouraged him to walk towards the beach.
It's fine!
Beautiful Kaikkonen told me that he was going to swim a lot this summer.
Liette's swimming is good for her.
Like Iines Kaikkose, with a tablespoon, she practiced a swimming pool with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You can also be satisfied with the achievements of today, swimming pool.
Jami Kallio, four, once again wanted to go to the water level.
Her daughter Anna Villberg, 6-year-old Ilona Villberg, who followed a swimming pool on the beach, considers the beach school a good start for swimming teaching.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna likes to go here every day.
Sometimes he was warming up.
Swimming schools were packed on the floor.
The boys had enough sweat with the flour found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread to the layer towels, picked up fruit and pitched the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but no hurry was held on the floor.
As if not in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells baths - "This is a similar story"
All kinds of people see it.
The product that manufactures cleaning products was launched a few days ago by the Unknown Soldier product series.
Then presses and dishwashers, as well as "wc-share with a row-share."
An unknown soldier refers to the first-night film and leaf marketing in this autumn.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been embroidered on social media: When will Unknown Health come?
You need to call the company and ask what this is.
What does the Vice-President Aino Määttä say?
We are a film partner.
We support this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cultural films, Mött said.
He says that the products will come into the movement of a special presentation, so the film will be visible.
Isn't there a little bit of fun here - often when you think that the products and stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, here's a similar story that combines that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products, Mötta says.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish basic values that are supported by those who have seen an unknown old soldier.
And cleaning is not a guest for military culture, Mete notes.
Other business partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall’s vichys have been introduced to the market, which are known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already recorded by Finnish Blogger Kuvalehden Kalle Kinnunen
There are also coffee and watches available.
Kinnunte notes that the film is still in the next evening, so the next one is still in permission.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their military products, for example, Valio, Jalostajat, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers’ age tests were published
The latest results in the medical age tests of Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80 percent of the tests were determined to be older than 18 years of age. However, they do not all consider the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Legal Medicine Agency started the test earlier this year.
The tests can assess the age of the asylum seeker in the past, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish immigration agency was assessed that it failed to determine the actual age of those claiming to be minors.
The immigration agency has done 6,880 tests so far, and the legal medicine agency has now published 2,481 test results. The tests were conducted between mid-March and late July 2017.
In 2002, 80 percent of the tests were identified as asylum seekers over 18 years of age, and in addition, the Legal Medicine Agency determined 25 cases that the test was "possible to be 18 years of age or older".
In the case of 432, it was concluded that asylum seeker is "probably under the age of 18".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason for suspicion of the age notified by the applicant.
Johan Göransson's Legal Medicine Agency reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The numbers are quite consistent. There are no big differences in statistics in the past months," she told The Local.
Although most of the applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, it might not necessarily mean that the applicants would have lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and reported that 442 cases were "indications that the study is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it appeared that 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he had been fulfilling this year for 18 years.
In the medical age evaluation method used in tests, X-rays are taken from intelligent teeth and magnetic knees. Then dentist and radiologists analyze pictures. The method is also criticized.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, endocrinologist of the Carolina Institute, whose work involves an assessment of human biological maturity. The assessment can determine whether a person has become a fractured person earlier or later.
“I have had a reason to think about this, and I think that the method used is not correct.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
“If we can’t be able to determine the age, we shouldn’t be convinced that we can do so,” he told Metro.
Nevertheless, Göransson, of the Law Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: “It is generally possible to say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where testing must be fulfilled within 18 years, and then the risk is about 10 per cent."
Iron Broke 30 Places in Scotland
In the third round, the result of over five pairs was Mikko Ilose’s 30 episodes in a downward score in the European Golf Course competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday at 11th, but was found to split 41th at the end of the round.
There was a lot of joy in the triangle of three gods to join one doublebog.
Others were difficult too.
The Englishman, Ian Poulter, rose up to share the upper place with one under a pair of circles, although he said there was a lot of work in the rainforest.
The cheli was raw, but it broke with and finally the day was good, Poulter's heart.
He shares the pedestrian with his landlord Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Western Virginia Governor Exchanges Party
Western Virginia’s Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday night Trump’s campaign event would change his party.
“The Democrats simply rejected me,” Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after a lot of prayers and in-depth consideration... Today I will tell Westerners that I can no longer help you as the governor of Democrats."
The audience went into popularity.
"Tomorrow you will be a member of the registered Republican party," Justice added.
"As a voter, I'd say to you that it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a significant announcement will be made during the campaign event in Western Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016 and Forbes said he was the only billionaire in his state.
He inherits a mining company from his father and owns coal plants in five states.
The value of his assets is about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday evening that "the Justice Party Exchange is again a new strike for a democratic party that prefers building obstacles rather than better America."
"Democrates have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the last restraint to a party with no leadership and unable to find a positive, combined human message," RNC representative Ronna McDaniel said in a CBS news statement.
Injured injuries - from Thursday to the very summer falling day
The end of the week will also be added to Southern Finland.
During the past week, it has fallen especially in the middle and northern region of the country, as well as in the region of Warsaw-Finland.
Between mid-week and Thursday night, the salaman masks hit several firearms.
According to meteorologists, Thursday may be the very day of the fall of the summer until now.
Finally, it has also been found in Finland.
During the past week, it has been invaded especially in the middle and northern region of the country, as well as in the region of Warsaw-Finland.
At the end of the salama attacked a rival power station, causing a small fire.
The rescue agency received an announcement of the ball about guardless on Wednesday night.
The electricity center is located in the sauna, far from the rivalry.
The rescue facility pulled off the roof and wall to find the palopes and cut off the fire with a whirlwind.
A total of 11 apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In the landscape again, the salama hit the outer building in Harjulantia before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already at the full stage of the fire, and the rescue facility could only prevent the spread of the fire.
The size of approximately fifty square meters of the outer building burned the ground.
In the middle of the night, the salama attacked the house.
The residents of the house were outside of the building and proved a stunning salamansk.
The rescue agency went to check the case, but this time the salama didn't get an early fire -- only a few closed bridges.
During the traffic, the fall caused problems with the train between the Seina River and Vaasa, while the Salamanca damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the error was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which trains were replaced by trains.
The problem could be fixed just a little before five afternoon.
Later, train traffic has normally been continued by running a wheelchair.
The swords have been destroyed across Finland.
This summer, however, has been very small.
This summer’s crashes have been quite overwhelmed! estimated the ongoing meteorologist Jari Tuovinen by the Institute of Climate Science.
In the mid-week and Thursday, the crushers have been mainly moderate, but thanks to the low summer salt, it feels so much even strong.
This might seem to be really hard, but that's what it's been compared to this summer, Tovinen says.
On Wednesday, 1,700 times the earthquake crashed, and on Thursday there was a potential for even the harder summer falling day: about 16 p.m. on the plateau was 1,790 earthquake.
If the encryption continues at the beginning, you can reach more than two thousand salads, Touvinen predicts.
The previous recording year of decline was tested in 2015, with the year's swamp amounting to about 30,000 pieces.
By Wednesday this year, the number of salads had increased to 18,386 salads.
So it is still possible that this year will not breach the "record" after two years.
However, it can be expected to continue.
According to imports, the air in Finland also remains warm and moisture during the weekend, which is a welcoming birth environment for cravings.
The main pressure of Ukkosten is transferred from the northern part of the country to the south, where approximately 2,000 salam days can be obtained both on Saturdays and on Sundays.
In the middle of the earth, there is more uniform rainfall.
In such a case, it's just a little bit.
Coe praises Russia’s “official” apology for the doping scandal
The world’s public sport permit Sebastian Coe praised his openness to describe the apology that Russia filed on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but Coe added that it wasn’t time to stop the Russian participation ban.
Russia’s general sportsman Dmitri Shljahtin said on Thursday at the IAAF Congress that Russia’s ban is appropriate and that he intends to fight deliberately against doping.
He said he regretted “for all the athletes who were held in the competitions of gold or silver.”
Despite his comments, IAAF's Congress voted in favour of the prolongation of the ban, Russia was excluded from public sports competitions in November 2015 after the WADA World Antidoping Office had submitted evidence of the government's support for doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very straightforward and it was a fairly open presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased to admit that the Russian General Sports Union had passed the country in difficult times and announced that it was doing all its possible to reorganize its activities."
Coe also said he was “approved” by Russia’s approval of the terms of termination of the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress has taken place, but the Congress supports the working group’s recommendation that it is now not the right time to stop Russia’s ban,” Coe said.
“We have to do it for the next few months to normalize our situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep the clean athletes separated from the disturbed system,” he added.
Nine Russian athletes are competing with a neutral athlete status at the World Championships in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, Chairman of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia must still meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient, and trainers who have been banned are still working freely," he told reporters on Friday following a statement from the IAAF Council in London.
Production company deceived Tom of Finland's film for weak success
The film Tom of Finland has not become such a success as the actors hoped, says Yle.
Honestly, I am disappointed to admit that the film was produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film can be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film was released on the first night of February 2017.
By the end of June it had reached fair 100,000 viewers, which is the budget of the film, approximately 5 million euros, compared to a little.
There is no lottery gain here, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been better in the country, they would have already got their money.
Now you have to wait for small brushes from abroad, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukosken.
How the economic rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European soccer euro money will not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France, but it is the most expensive transfer of football at all times.
Its possible penalties on Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will decide on the European Football Regulator UEFA, which can prevent the participation of the teams in a qualified Champions League.
In 2011, the UEFA introduced fair economic rules for the game, according to which the PSG must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has been paid €222 million after the end of the Brazilian agreement, and the annual salary of Neymar will move in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a variety of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar’s transfer amount and connecting him to its star card, following the financing of Qatar’s oil-rich rulers.
The tracks may use large amounts for the acquisition of players, but they must be balanced with real income sources so that football-related businesses are not losing.
The economic rules of the game were drawn up by the initiative of Michel Platin, elected president of the UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that success in debt was a fraud and led to serious problems if banks or owners attracted their support.
In 2011, the priority of fair economic rules of the game moved from the combined debts to monitor their losses.
The change meant that the performance of the business model used by Roman Abramovitch in Chelsea for the first time in 2003 was significantly difficult. Abramovitch purchased a promising team, spent huge amounts of players in procurement and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the Reil's financial rules will last until 2018. During this period, the followers will be able to make up to EUR 30 million of losses.
While Platini had to leave the role of UEFA president in 2015 in a scandalous manner, his follower Alexander Cefer also wants to delay the unforgettable use of the funds.
“The rules of the game are still in use, and we will also apply them in the future,” said Andrea Traverso, responsible for the fair game’s economic rules at UEFA, to the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of its agreement with a single compensation, it may allocate the amount in accounting for its new agreement for the entire duration of its duration.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount of EUR 44.4 million can be recorded over the next five years.
Based on the financial rules of the game, the first penalties were allocated in 2014. The largest penalties were imposed to PSG and Abu Dhabi to Manchester City funded.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and it was also ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors the collections that may attempt to circulate its financial provisions by increasing its incomes through the company-related tracking companies.
For example, if a Qatari undertaking supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, the UEFA does not calculate the aid as a real result.
This occurred when UEFA decided in 2014 that Qatari Tourism Authority’s support to PSG was limited.
It has also been revealed that some of the gains of Neymar in PSG could be funded by the Qatari World Cup 2022 Organization Committee for the World Cup.
However, the PSG and the Organizing Commission have refused Neymar to be a mission of the World Championships, which would be very easy for the UEFA to disclose such arrangements.
Due to PSG’s previous sanctions, UEFA will follow more detailed rules to companies.
Sources from the situation reported on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency provided that their identity is not disclosed because they have no power to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published account, PSG’s turnover was EUR 542.4 million for the period 2015-2016 and the turnover was EUR 10 million over.
The last season’s accounts have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase the sale of follow-up products and playgrounds.
The follow-up estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent with the Neymar Agreement.
The legacy of Spain, which was clearly enraged at the departure of the world’s best player, tried to make Neymar more difficult to transfer, claiming to violate the rules of the fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both follow-up and state," the Spanish league president Javier Tebas said to the Spanish AS magazine.
Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger is also responsible for financing the state’s football field. Arsenal owns an American sports club.
“The attack is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It becomes very difficult to comply with the economic rules of the game. There are so many interests related to the fact that a famous player represents the state."
Now it's fast: Finland's championship coach in Helsinki
Arttu Pajude and the three-seater Kristina Mäkelea coach Suren Ghazaryan is in a row in Helsinki, although he should train at the World Cup in London.
Kristina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in lengthy weight and Mäkelä on Saturday in three hours.
However, two coachs, the Armenian Ghazaryan, have not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with it successfully in the British Embassy.
The coach has an invitation to the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but it has also not eligible to obtain a visa.
Whether this is the first Brexit symptoms, or what, coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always been successfully dealing with visa issues himself, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get out.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It's not so important.
As soon as someone looks at the stadium to the point of step, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about the potential failure.
The World Cup for Finland requires a miracle
The World Sports Championships will start in London on Friday and last the fair week ends on Sunday, August 13.
General sport, landscape and ice cream are the species that Finnish bank athletes are passionately treated by year to year, whether they are successful or not.
Success in the hearts of banking athletes is measured in the mitals.
There are also other meters.
Less attention is given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the values to the other, where the experience gains the performance of the athlete to the level that the adult MM is really possible.
Now there are no young athletes in the Finnish small championship team, nor are there any concrete athletes.
The World Cup for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can also happen.
It attracts bank athletes to the TV network and slides to follow the kisses, although London’s metres are resolved due to the time of the evening only.
The 2015 World Championships of the previous World Cup in Finland won one promsital.
It was brought by the speaker Tero Longkämäki.
The believers are now waiting for the Long Meal, although the second tells the results of the last time he and the other casters, as well as the remaining Long Meal in the last summer’s fairy tales.
In any case, Longkämäki remains a great Finnish sportsman in history.
Access to the final competition or making your own recording for other kittens is sufficiently good performance.
Hope and belief in the realistic milestones of Finland’s future years of public sport will make a good success in the international value matches of young people this summer.
The refining of young talents and the financial support of their work is more important than maintaining a small elite team of representative athletes.
Success does not come at a moment, but requires years of work for athletes and patience, both training and banking athletes.
The Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London races will remain in history as the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not, for example, because of terror or smoking attacks.
Before the Ruka Lake second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Enni Ruka Lake is located in the second big air match in Colorados.
Copper Mountain is the best big air in the Ruka Lake World Cup.

Viking Line's new fast-speed ship hits to port in Helsinki
Viking's new fast-track ship FSTR is late in the schedule.
The small boat had to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 18:00.
There were eight ships on board.
The ship was late to Helsinki.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get to the ship.
Now the car ride moves a bit, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is expected to access the vessel at the port of Helsinki, told at 19:30.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical mistake.
Rebane told me that the equipment company had brought access to the vessel of water bottles waiting in its cars.
Viking Communications Chief Christa Grönlund tells IS that it was a technical mistake.
It was corrected at Helsinki port.
The ship is leaving Helsinki for a couple of hours late.
Groenlund says the ship is also late for a couple of hours when returning to Tallinn.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20:15.

Small District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story smells both the days of the 80s and the grunge of the 90s (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great The State series for MTV) and their own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved to their career with the bigger.
As a cultural product, it is a description of both the parodia and the ongoing memory that we have trained in the Facebook season.
As a commercial product, it feels already alive.
First Day of Camp acted surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humor (among other things, you were told as the background of H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
The key to the joke is that medieval actors play full-aged teenagers who are closer to the full-aged. The emphasis on it makes it a part of the joke that it is impossible to achieve the past.
The Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotionally based, and its parodia is more diffuse: it parodies, for example, stalkers of the 90s, such as the horror movie Hand which can be used.
At one point, one of the characters shows the Apple Powerbook, inline rollers, and "modify the big year of 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet reached Katies (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in one of the crazy acts, Ronald Reagan (as such as Michael Showalter) is involved as a criminal partner George H. W. Bush (which is mostly acclaimed by Michael Ian Black).
As always in these series, it is best to be lateral.
It is especially fun to see any young Paul Rudd, who has a subdivision of the "soul patch" film by Matt Dillon from Singles. Ruddin's actress Andy, the camp gift, begins to be an old mother.
The moments of accidental madness may raise this series as a recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series is resuming the second type of nostalgia: The Americans’s Cold War Spirit, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series’s pressing response to the west.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and was directed by Rhys Thomas. It was made a Roman police drama in the 1980s, where a Bucharest couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism lenism.
In majors as Gregorian and idealist Iosefina, Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici are viewed as their roles in English, Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there isn't much more.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (politics spend time watching the TV in the same way as Americans watching football).
There are a number of famous actors including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective remains too attached to the trace of the socialist drama of the turkey – for example, there is a killer behind Reagan’s navy, which is why the series often begins to feel turkey propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or abundant.
The series could act better as agitprop-satirin, though, when Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly visiting the U.S. embassy and in the eagle there are always two fat men in hamburgers.
A message to the Communist public is that western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginative Roman creators of the series weren’t wrong: we’re ashamed of our own close history and their history as well.
Kouvolan Toni Tauru will rise from Macao on Saturday - against former UFC player
Toni Tauru wants to hold the match upstairs.
Toni Tauru receives a heavy bone in Macao because Brazilian Leandro Issa took it in UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has a black sweat and a species world championship.
I'm going to take up my own parents once.
It's a funny thing, a 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvolan had to rise up in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was revoked due to logistical problems, but three battles were held in a short-term schedule to the Chinese self-government area in Macao.
Tauru has never met so many of them before.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It was irritating because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, he is pleased to have a new time for the competition.
The week’s expectation will hardly affect the preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, because it does not increase in the week.
The condition can be even worse if you are practicing too much now.
Tauru has encountered several opponents in the previous struggle, whose strengths are vertical.
This time the situation is different.
The Dad of Kovola describes it as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive kidnapper.
I bet he's going to get to the first hard one and try to get to the mattress.
He has won the world championship, so he knows how to run.
The previous match of Kouvola didn't work according to plans.
The Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Taurua badly in the eye, and the victory remained for the Philippines.
I’ve never done so well in front of him: he hasn’t got anything to do with him.
When I went out, he touched my eyes.
It really hurts for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the volunteers take once a year, some rise in the body more densely.
For example, the next opponent Issa took the last time in September.
The Tauru had three matches last year.
There is a second fight in front of the last year.
Sometimes the bag has become pregnant.
I have been trained in the last few years and have been in good condition all the time.
However, I just took it for taking it.
When a 32-year-old heard about the future meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the pleasure of making it back.
We got really good coaching when one guy from Sweden was involved.
The exercise was a great help, because on Saturday the Kovolan must prepare for physical struggle.
I have been trained against the same size opponents and trained up.
It is a 32-year-old main tactical.
You have to beat it wisely.
If there is an opportunity, I'll take it to the ground myself.
Lower ingredients should not be given for free, because they are consumed most.
Macao is also attracted to the disease in China.
That's what I've heard about in China.
I think there's a big and nice night in front.
The Bank of England holds 0.25 percent interest rates
The British Central Bank is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates in anticipation after economic growth has been inefficient and inflation has ceased to speculation on coronary rates.
The Central Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue slowly, and that the bank has transferred crowns because the income level of families is increasingly pressured.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee decided to hold the rates of 0.25 per cent by 6 to 2 votes, and the rates were increasingly reduced this month because economic growth has been inefficient.
In its four-year inflation examination, the bank dropped its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that the income level of households would be subjected to even more pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate by nearly 3 per cent in autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates are needed to reduce the inflation accelerated by Brexit in the coming years, and the Bank has also announced that loan costs may be required to increase more expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which was launched a year ago in post-advertising Brexit referendum.
The Bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide a cheap funding for banks through the program of 15 million, a total of 115 million.
The Bank’s interest rate decision protocol states: “Slow growth in GDP in the coming years will continue, according to the forecast of the Commission for Money Policy, when the decline in real income in households will reduce consumption.”
As regards interest rates, the bank reiterated that the expectations of the market were "a bit more broader" in order to eliminate inflation.
The markets currently predict the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that possible increases are "state" and "real".
In May, the bank predicted 1.9% growth for this year and 1.7% growth for next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast by 1.8%.
Punta was weakened as a result of the news about the dollar and the euro.
The pound was less than 0.5% compared to the dollar and was $1.31; the euro was less than 0.4% compared to the dollar and was $1.11.
The decision remains that interest rates were taken in advance after the expected weaker growth rates increased the expectations of coronation rates; GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 percent in the third quarter but to rise at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation perspective only gave a little hope for households with fast inflation and sharp salary increases, and the situation is getting worse before it becomes worse.
The bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" the decline in revenue in the coming years, but it expects that the salary development will "significantly" recover at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak weight, which revokes part of the impact of private consumption decline.
The decision was made a year after the rates were calculated to 0.25 percent after the EU referendum resulted in shock, which fell into weight loss.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will likely begin to appear in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the most recent decision of the Central Bank was made to demand more and more voice when inflation raised the pressure on households. Three finalists asked for a 0.5 percent korona in July.
Inflation grew up 2.6 per cent last month from 2.6 per cent in June, but the bank said it was expected and inflation will again climb over the next few months.
According to the bank, the surpassing of its two-percent target was due to "totally" weak weight.
“When taking into account the recent decline in swap interest rates, competition in the housing loan market would seem to grow further, as lenders warmly request customers and want to end the year strongly,” says Coreco Mortgage Brokers CEO Andrew Montlake.
"The markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is ending. The new agreements are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low and there are also useless options available."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients can be prescribed a "reverse" HIV anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the drug in the public health system of England (NHS).
NHS reported that PrEP was prescribed to about 10 000 people during the first three-year trials, with a decrease in the infection risk of approximately 86% in individuals.
NHS agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Justice was held in force in the last year's judgment of the Supreme Court. According to the NHS, it is able to pay the PrEP medicine, although they claim that local authorities should finance it.
England’s NHS chief Simon Stevens called the decision on Thursday “a remarkable new intervention,” and the national AIDS organization described it “a very important moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield begin to receive notifications for a trial that extends to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full scale in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposed inhibitory therapy (PrEP) must be taken a HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
Before connecting, the drug to be taken means that there are sufficient drugs in the body during connecting that prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatments includes homosexuals, bisexuals and transgenders, as well as people with HIV-positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics select the test conditions that are satisfied by applicants from men, women and transgender as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is unknown to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and enrolled in the treatment of a general physician may also apply for an experiment with their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs 10 million pounds, and the NHS of England signed a contract for drugs this week after the international tender.
The aim of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its orientation, take and implementation of treatment.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the existing and more and more diverse means of HIV prevention,” Stevens says.
“This is once again a significant achievement in the fight for more than 30 years in solving the biggest health challenge of humanity.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” Deborah Gold, head of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted to those who need it and belong to the risk groups, it may have a reverse effect on the English HIV epidemic.
From September to September, the risk group gets a drug funded by NHS, which they can decide independently without having to negotiate with a partner without need. It has an intense effect that will improve the lives of many people.
This was a welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched rapidly throughout the country and no one belonging to a risk group will stay out of it,” says Terrence Higgins Foundation CEO Ian Green.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people from HIV contamination."
"The start of the PrEP test is a welcome event that took place for several months because of the government's slowdown," Sharon Hodgson, Sharon Hodgson, said.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a reverse effect on our work we do to prevent HIV and stop spreading this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of the PrEP drug.
Now it is important that the test be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect HIV-exposed people and get a step further into a situation where the spread of HIV in society has succeeded in stopping."
Life quality: intermediate and smart interior solutions have made a small apartment from Earl's Court to a spacious home
Ex-banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is Queen Anna's stylish house on the first floor of the time. Remont's success tells her that Joanne has not yet escaped her fighters and changed.
"This before I lived with my grandfather at Knightsbridge in a significantly larger apartment," Joanne says.
“I’m looking for something similar in my price class.
I visited the apartment screen here and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment.
I liked it right away and made the offer the same day.”
Since then, about 90 square apartments have experienced a complete change of shape.
Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a middle floor so that the room elevation could be exploited.
"I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
It was my demand,” he said.
She hired for her work from the Duck & Shed design office in Erfan Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to take advantage of the state of nearly four meters high rooms and to create an apartment, which was not only a repair and sales point but also a home.
The height of the room was not sufficient for two overheads, so the challenge was to build a middle floor where he was able to stand.
The solution requires Erfan’s creative thinking.
“The steel structures are quite complicated.
The premises had to be arranged above so that they didn’t need a wheel.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was precisely suitable both on them and under them.”
Erfan was able to place the space above two full-high rooms in fascinating details.
On the middle floor, the copper window of Retrouvius opens to a stylish residence.
Mirror furniture, silver herbs and Serge Mouillen vintage lamps create a unique style.
The use of mirrors brings theatre, feeling and light.
The mirrors on both sides of the short walk make the walk look real longer.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window from which the view to the other room opens.
The mirror surface of the entrance furniture has a storage space for Joanne's athletes and glasses.
The style adds to the fact that the kitchen is hidden when it is not used.
The kitchens equipped with a taste door are not a new solution,
But Joanne’s kitchen is unique that the door is lifted up in the same way as the door of the car room.
"It requires a little design," Erfan says about the stainless steel MDF door.
"It is balanced, i.e. it moves when rising very easily into its places."
With an intense spatial use and storage style design, Joanne received 16 additional squares, a second bedroom and a better base solution.
“When the apartment is sold, the area is resolved – or the property’s value,” Erfan says.
"In the basic case, the real estate broker walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In the Joanne apartment, the surface area was added using high-quality materials that bring the space luxury.
“Avis is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the senses of the apartment are partially created on the basis of them,” Erfan says.
“No one cares about the electrical cables on the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne apartment is an example of the fact that good design and extra spaces can make the basic apartment an exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you don’t want to move out of the apartment anymore.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiates in her summer class
Princess Sofia's residence was pushed.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden's Båstad for the last time before her birth.

On Wednesday, Sofia represented a Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a beautiful blue guardhouse, dressed up with a beautifully pregnant princess.
Sophia has come to an event in a dark residential area.
This is the last event in which Sofia represents before her birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For the dinner event, Sofia had chosen her most beautiful pastel engineer dress, which landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little pocket.
The blue pastels are fine for the princess.
Sofia has been on a representative trip to Sweden in Båstad this week.
Sophia lives in a small carpet.
Sophia has a direct radiation in its summer class.
Sofia was excited to talk to photographers.
Now I just keep my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to her end-to-earth period.
He grows us with a sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, the Lahden Tower appeared in a house where Thai food was sold.
The lattes did not dare to taste, but walked over.
In size, Panya Suamsri-Penttilä sold food, among the familiar Panja.
He couldn’t get Finnish, and the Finnish hadn’t yet been able to get Thais at that time.
Because the people did not dare to go to eat, Panja offered free taste.
This is how he taught the Lachians to eat Thai food, for the spring at once.
"Taste of the country," he said.
I stayed in the valley.
I went more and more, finally every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened a Thai dining room at the Lahde Chamber of Commerce.
There were two small tables, customers were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the windmill.
When hungry and places are limited, you can’t leave an empty chair between yourself and your guest.
The little girl met us better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat at the table with a dictionary teaching Thai language.
Two years went on the side of the business office, but then the restaurant had to change, because the tastework that I heard was too smellful in the hall.
A new place was released from the entrance to the trade hall.
There's room.
Now we jurists can again sit on our own tables, only in the most cruel times we have to go on to ask if there is room next to us.
Panja knows his customers.
They tell him where he has been used and who he has seen.
He knows what everybody eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the diet is changing.
She remembers when I was eating my first spring ride with a man named.
He reminds me of a fat and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place next to the door of the kitchen, and exchange your belongings with the stinging Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili.
He has opened our taste in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many speak to him thai - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Although he has had difficulty, he is always kind.
He's hard.
In the restaurant, he goes to the fungus and the black.
Last week in the restaurant was celebrated the difficulty of filling for two decades.
We and our customers got meat after meal of butterflies.
Without alarm or attention, this important day went to the end of the work.
The founding of the underground base reveals 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a significant list of anti-terrorism work.
The list contains more than 170 ISIS players who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German journal Die Welt, a total of 173 people have a document containing not only their personal data, but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of the people listed on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They originate in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tadzhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening-Sanomat told me about the list and a few weeks back.
The location of the list and the information contained in it are now detailed.
According to the newspaper, the special forces of the Iraqi Army found personal data and pictures of terrorists in the study of the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities evaluate the authenticity of papers and send them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
In the background, there was fear that something big and serious would be planned by the terrorists in the west in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list has not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented subtitles and information about the country of the person.
The list also highlights the specialties of terrorists.
For example, a 27-year-old German named Sami J. is named Abu Assid al-Alman, a German.
He was told to leave Germany in 2012 when he first traveled to Egypt, then to Libya and later to Turkey to join the ISIS lines.
The photograph was written to her as a specialty suicide bomber.
There is no more detailed information about the fate of a man.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left the lines of the ISIS from Europe, whose fate is uncertain.
The man dropped under the surface in Helsinki Tokoinrain
Based on the rescue agency interviews, the man wanted to show him to be able to swim.
A man can save the deadly soul.
In Helsinki's Tokoinrain, a man who fell under water was saved on Thursday.
According to the Helsingh rescue agency’s firearmsman Ville Estlander, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water for about 15 minutes after the notice.
The rescue agent found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue agency received a notification about half the afternoon.
The person was delivered in the first hand of treatment.
Estolander tells us about a 50-year-old man.
Based on the interviews, the man wanted to show him to be able to swim.
The situation in Tokoinrain is already over.
Estolander thanks the government’s cooperation with the Border Protection Agency and the police.
This was the task led by the Border Protection Agency.
The locals also trained the suckers greatly.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the border guard and the police.
Two passenger cars hit in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom were mildly injured, says the flaming fireman.
Injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred on the crossing of three roads at four hours of the day.
The collar occurred when another car turned to the warning triangle in front of the other car, the flaming fireman said.
According to the rescue facility, the cruise area has an hourly speed limit of 80 km.
Brothers fight for more than $500 million real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria’s largest real estate period, worth more than $500 million, and the dispute relates to their Italian family 40 years ago to establish a family.
The former chairman and real estate developer of Carlton, Colin De Lutis, lives in Toorak’s value area only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought the highest right to the division of real estate and business among the brothers.
Paul has already wanted to leave his family business since 2014, but the difference has been discouraged.
The brothers and their mother Anna shared 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to collect assets when they purchased a trade in Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store, which extends 160 movement chains.
The trade chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the municipality.
According to an agreement made with the family's past father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's property and Paul about a third of Paul. Paul describes his father as a "bearing family power and a central hammer".
According to the legal documents, the share ratio of property means that Colin owns real estate worth about $316 million and Paul worth about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the sharing of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best property for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first conditional certificate to court in 2015.
The case was discussed last Friday for the first time in the highest court after several reconciliation companies.
The brothers are also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says that the claim is not true, and he accuses Paul of taking care of some real estate.
Colin writes together with his first conditional evidence that he would like to get the solution in this matter.
“In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me,” Colin said in his statement.
The cost of the case is constantly growing. Conditional statements, emails and reports have hundreds of pages. The case is reported by consulting companies like Deloitten, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her advanced husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and taste stores in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a trade from Brunswick.
They were used as a family insurance for buying a real estate from Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first farm shop.
Colin says he founded a trade "in the last few years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that in 2012, he and the dead, Luigi wanted to transfer the real estate to their sons.
"Luigi often stated that he doesn't want the brother's ending justice," Anna wrote in her statement.
The family's two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of De Lutis Group. According to Colin, Mark got $10 million and Luke got $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “a breakdown of their financial conditions.”
Colin has had a low profile, although she is a former member of the Australian Football League government and television star Eddie McGuiren’s best friend according to this 2015 lifestyle.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Luti and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and in his text message he told me that it was not possible to comment on the matter rightly because it was addressed in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me to court and draw me to court, according to the name of our family,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree with his brother’s claims.
“Our father wouldn’t want us to argue in this way,” Colin continued, saying that he had hoped to be resolved.
Hope seemed to be disrupted on Friday.
“We can be judged in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new staff chief is planning to restrict the media use of the president.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly finally succeeded.
First of all.
According to Poltico, the new White House staff chief plans to restrict President Trump's media use and news monitoring so that the boss will not be in trouble so often.
Reporter Josh Dawsey said:
“When the new White House staff chief John F. Kelly met with the manager on his first working day, he spoke to the key problem he intends to solve: he is planning to restrict President Donald Trump’s statement.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information – both printed and heard in information reports – must pass through it because the president makes better decisions when getting good information.”
Kelly said that it’s good, but others have tried to restrict Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long television relationship – and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"When President Trump was nervous about unfair news, his support showed that memorable media treated things more fairly," Trump's campaign as an adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February.
At that time, reporter Tara Palmeri wrote that, according to a six-time campaigner, “it is essential for Trump’s use of Twitter to control that his personal media flow belongs to a uniform flow of bodies.”
Okay, okay.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter would never have been in control.
Maybe these campaigners know something we don’t know – maybe Trump’s twitters would have been even worse without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump has left without.
If his staff has even been able to prevent him from having problems, their work has not been inconvenient.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump’s harassment.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their business by providing Trump with information that supports their views.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
“The current and former Trump’s employees say he can be angry with the magazines in which he is evaluated – especially if they tell about harmful years of information, and then he will have to know where the information comes from.
This happened at the end of February, when someone gave a copy of the news on GotNews.com founded by prosecutor Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Vice-Personal Chief Katie Walshi of several data years of the White House.
Johnson was permanently removed from Twitter due to anxiety, and he had previously spread false charges and revoked them later, and he did not present any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started the matter, including the question of the staff of Walshi."
Goldmacher added that at the time staff chief Reince Priebus and the White House staff secretary Rob Porter “are trying to introduce the system of handling documents to Trump.”
What was the result?
Kelly will try the same three months later.
Perhaps he is more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistant continues to drive his own things.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar concludes five-year agreement with PSG
Brazilian actor Neymar has signed a five-year deal with the French football player PSG, the news agency AFP says.
Earlier Thursday evening, Neymar’s representatives had paid a €222 million outstanding prize for the FC Barcelona player in the Spanish League.
The deal with Neymar with Barcelona was therefore broken down, and he was free to move to the PSG in Paris.
The sum of transfers of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which paid last summer €105 million to French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The chairman of the tournament is former tennismate, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to arrive on Friday in Paris.
Successful writer Raija Oranen explained in the hypnosis of alcoholism and air gambling: "I'm in the condition of my life"
From the TV series, the time and clean white lanes, the famous successful writer Raija Oranen spent just the 69th anniversary.
Hypnosis helped Raija City.
Five children like their grandmothers as well as their writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki left the sun of Spain and the apartment of Fuengirola after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left a rental apartment.
In the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raijan in his time brought depression and alcoholism that he survived.
The external nature is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went down when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mental drugs.
Alcoholism helped me by hypnosis, which also did in the airfield, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes from man, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and the tourist industry, Jyrki Oranen, have been together for over 40 years.
I got married, and it was going to be married in two weeks, Raija laughed.
This kind of drama queen she has always been, ended her life with that, Jyrki laughed at his wife.
A number of writers made by Oranen remember only the good 44 parts of the Clean white cables of the TV series that touched and moved late-time Finland.
Finally, I decided to become the industry industry of the Raika family when I read the 50th anniversary of Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary on the plane.
I was the daughter of an emperor myself, and my mother also had a clothing movement and sometimes acting as a mannequin, Oranen remembers.
The story and story of the series changed the Finnish attitude to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savey's research and the claimant revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as an active writer of time, he has many scripts under the work - hundreds of ideas.
The Kiertoes return to the "Millioners"
The wealthiest household owners in Western Midlands are once again stuck with self-superficial circles who managed to cross the corner of the municipality and return to the neighbourhood of the houses.
The Kiertoyans parked their twenty residential cars as a millionaire hut near the street called Solihullis.
They were dismissed from the area in May, but they managed to cross the municipality’s ruins, bringing children, horses, and the army of packaged cars.
The Cirtoes managed to overcome the passage point that had been left unprotected from the path.
Angry residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
The unnominated resident tells the circling coming on Monday evening of Bentley Heath, where they had thrown the passagers on stones.
“It must be hard to act because it feels totally incapable of solving the problem.
The Kirto were here in May, then they left but returned.
They came tonight and probably even more today.”
The resident told me that the town of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything to it."
According to another unnamed resident, it is ridiculous that the tours come back so soon after they were driven away.
"They've had more in the past, and they've even climbed a horse to ride in the park."
According to the informant of the Solihull municipality, the municipality is aware of the illegal camps near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the legal action necessary with the Solihull police to urge the camps as soon as possible.
For the collection of evidence, it is extremely important that as many locals as possible make a report to the police of disturbant or criminal activity.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for judicial proceedings."
Angry people surround Portugal's turmoil
In Portugal, the men who have committed compulsory crimes on the beach have been interrogated in court today.
Two people died as a result of a forced attack yesterday.
Two men flying on the plane may be charged with death.
It is possible to get 16 years in jail in Portugal.
The male-flighted small plane had to be made yesterday due to a technical mistake in the compulsion of Sao Joao da Caparican, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of which fled into the water.
The machine hits a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first hit a man who was on the mirror.
Immediately after that the machine rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said Philipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
On the beach, the oils surrounded the small machine immediately after the collapse.
The girl's father and other people went to the machine and began to crawl behind it, said Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the flyer a criminal, he was desperate.
It's amazing that no more people are dead.
Two men in the car weren't injured.
The tragically lost Finnish champion won the World Championship again: "Without an accident I wouldn't be a world champion"
Matti Grand-Hamari celebrates early Wednesday morning Finland's time of the World Cup gold banked in slalom in the competition held in Big White, Canada.
The Grand-Hamaris also won the Crossin World Cup in the previous battles.
The titles of the MM have already been collected.
Very incredible championships!
Two times gold was treated, a very good heart driven, the Great Hamar met on the phone was happy.
A 30-year-old coach thanked his coach for his successful preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamar, the number of respondents in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralysis has grown and developed a lot in recent times.
The differences are reduced, and there are a lot of new ladders.
He always wonders if there's a black horse.
Every game seems to be a different winner.
Big-Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle crash in 2009.
He had been excited from young to young with his friends, and the accident did not take the desire to get into the breast.
Sometimes it comes to thinking what kind of life would be without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's uncomfortable.
These cards play what has been shared, Big Hamar emphasizes.
It would be a cruel title for a serious accident and loss of a rabbit for luck, and not for the Great Hamar.
But he turned to the advantage of harsh difficulty.
Yeah, I'd say that the situation turned into a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Big Hammer’s biggest rally was already in the fall.
Duuni to the top began to visit the truth only after the accident.
I trained with young guys, and we always lost our enthusiastically X-Games.
But they were distant hacks, which were defeated with some time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow at the start of X-Games.
I couldn't imagine beforehand.
I was 23 years old, and I thought that this would be a really long life if I stay here to get stuck and fucked up.
I decided to pull the hackers into the niche and start working.
I'd say I've been doing so well.
Laskija enjoyed the Leo-Pekka bike chair player’s choice for the year’s athlete.
The four-legged Olympic winner won a prize in the sports hall held in January.
The Star win is an important signal for a sportsman.
It was really a big thing, and the win was definitely earned.
This will also open eyes to the world of sports.
When is it time to start the double world champion Matti Grand-Hamar athlete campaign?
We'll see it at the time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamar has not yet conquered all the tops he desires.
Next year we will have a big goal.
After a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
Yes, we're going to get the medal!
Most Syrian refugees do not believe they will return permanently to their homeland unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees are taking bread in refugee camps in Jordan.
Most Syrians do not believe they will return permanently to their homeland.
They say the end of the Syrian war and the departure of ISIS are the most important things to happen in order to be able to return to their homeland.
Trump’s government does not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller Communications Agency found the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has already studied the opinions and attitudes of Arabs in nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18-24, half of which are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
More than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home in the future.
42 percent of respondents may think they are going back to their home country and 4 percent couldn’t say.
According to the study, the end of the youth's return to home is the most affected by the Syrian war and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) of the end of the war considers the most influential factor, while the fourth believes that the most important thing would be to leave the country of Isis.
Only less than a tenth will make the most important decisions to improve the economic situation or to leave Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military actions do not solve the conflict alone
The Syrians were asked what was the most important factor in resolving the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad from power.
The fourth line of the al-Assad presidency is a barrier to the peace treaty.
Nearly half of the Syrians have experienced the need for political and military solutions to stop the current Syrian conflict.
The resolution of the conflict by means of mere military actions does not believe as a quarter of fairness.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see the weakening of ISIS in the last year, while the fifth is experienced by the strengthening of its power.
According to the respondents, the main thing in the fight against Dads is, and generally against terrorism, that the media would communicate information to people that ISIS had nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many have raised the priority of military measures as well as training proof.
The 10th of Reil believes that the most important thing is to create better jobs for young people.
Asked about the impact of Trump’s administration on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump’s administration.
Nearly every four believes that the Syrian conflict is getting worse during Trump’s period.
The ideas are divided into two in terms of whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time encoding to keep the internet in order - for example, Wikipedia and Google use his database
The company MariaDB develops a "the world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by Widen by Michael "Monty", does not pay any of the users, and it can be developed by any online developer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they may not necessarily be paid to customers.
The databases allow huge data mass to remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and the images are linked there,” Widenius explains.
Widenius, who serves as a technology manager of MariaDB, spends about half of his time encoding.
A man who makes a distance from beautiful hands will help to make sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open-source database with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, Sun purchased MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, Oracle’s software was crafted for 7.4 billion Sun.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large number of MySQL developers reported their departure.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't give a certain promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius remembers.
At this stage, he had already founded a company that began developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his lifework to die.
I hired from Sun a couple of the best developers and saw that the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own hair.
I just had to change the name.
Freedom of development of the MariaDB Code for supervision was established by the Foundation.
"During MySQL, these assurances have not been made," Widenius harmittelee.
Although many have heard about Widen and MySQL’s billionaire trade, the Finnish rarely knows anything about MariaDB.
“The last years our growth trend has been about 50% per year,” says MariaDB’s economic director Kenneth Paqvalén.
Growth-focused MariaDB is not yet a profit, and Paqvalén is a non-profit company identity number.
To this extent, it reveals that during the financial period MariaDB is estimated to receive orders of EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps in exchange databases, which can be a career for more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
MySQL exchange to MariaDB will be successful in a moment because they are versions of each other.
The Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia DBS are MariaDB’s paying customers.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud offer MariaDB to its customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest hairdressers.
“Our customers are among the world’s largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks, and even some of the central banks,” Paqvalé said.
The database markets are still dominating on their closed databases such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
For Oracle, MySQL is unnecessary from a website compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
According to Gartner, although the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, MariaDB’s turnover-measurements are still irrevocable, although rapidly growing sinks.
On the $50 billion database market, open-source databases do not even exceed a billion.
However, the weight value of open source cannot be measured only in cash, as most users don’t pay anything for these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then be exchanged to open, or at least the transition would be started.
Many companies do not get new customers because most of them choose the next open source.
This has led to the fact that commercial database license payments have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller customer number,” Widenius said.
Since the exchange of the closed database is difficult, most of the customers’ companies have been sharpened by price increases.
“There are a lot of customers who are really difficult to move because their old apps and others are locked in the database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the measurement of his customers is going to be complete.
When the licensing fee increases every year, the customer moves to an open source database sooner or later.
The price is 10-20% of the previous, and the service is better, as the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants.
Many companies are not only facing major system changes when they transfer their functions to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth fund ever granted by the EIB to the Northern countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now intended to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB funding was MariaDB’s impact on public procurement.
The company has public customers, for example in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros for databases annually.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use taxes more efficiently,” Paqvalén says.
Widenu regrets how money is collected in Finland in closed healthcare systems when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not in favour of a single software company.
Some say open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make a code.
A community helps and does something that is not self-invented or able to do.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most famous open-source promoters of another Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop operational business models to open source.
I still like 4-5 talks every year around the world about this topic.
Italy Increases Approach to NGO Rescue Ships
Italy has warned NGOs who rescue refugees on their vessels in the Mediterranean that they may not continue their activities unless they are committed to complying with new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not engage in the new guidelines, it is difficult to see how they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the tournament magazine La Stampa.
The warning came the day after the Italian authorities had retreated the ship of the German Jugend Rettet support group, which was suspicious to cooperate with the suspected human-slug drivers that promoted illegal immigration.
The agency, which has been acting for only a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us, the rescue of human lives is and will be the most important. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to act in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a social media statement.
“We can evaluate the accusations only after we have collected all the necessary information and are able to evaluate the situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitored by Jugend Rettet since the foundation of Iuventa in October.
The crew suspected that the ship was taken directly from human passengers who received the vessels re-use.
One such case is alleged to have fallen only a few kilometers from the coast of Libya. The information is found in the document of the prosecutor whose contents are published by the Italian media.
The men are suspected of threatening the Italian coastal guard, which monitors rescue activities in the region.
According to the Acting Guide, vessels such as Iuventa should be involved in an Italian police officer who monitors the activity.
Only three of nine NGOs participating in search and rescue activities have agreed to comply with the guidelines: Save Children and Maltan MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the rescue activities of the organization.
Among those who refuse to comply with the guidelines are the Nobel Prize Doctors Without Borders Organization.
Minniti, on the other hand, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has declined steadily in recent weeks, which he considers as evidence that the actions to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and cooperate with local municipal leaders are starting to produce results.
"In the last days, light has begun to be seen away from the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that the plans will continue discussions with the Libyan city leaders this month on economic development projects and on measures to reduce the number of refugees departing to Europe.
The seasonal workers suspected of being killed in Enontekiöö, suspected of land - case to the prosecutor
The suspected crime took place at the Enonthek's Cup last December.
Police said a 36-year-old Czech man was suspected of killing a 26-year-old Scottish kidnapper.
It has been told that both of them were seasonal workers.
The police also said the suspect had fled to the ground with two dogs after his work.
The man was found cold in the soil, and he did not resist when he was arrested.
The case must be raised in a short time within a week.
The case may be injured in the court of Lapi during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and All Hair Friends
British actor Robert Hardy died at the age of 91.
The actor’s death was reported by the family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started her actress at the 24-year-old theatre.
During his long career, he also played in films and television.
Hardy is particularly reminded of the role of Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter’s films and his veterinary role in the James Herriot book based on my Friend’s TV series.
The BBC's popular series was described in a total of seven times.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to jail for self-suicide messages
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for text messages and calls in which she was regarded as an excited boyfriend of herself Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, executes his 15-month sentence in prison and five years in condition.
Carter was sentenced to death in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter requested the amendment to the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be processed in the free.
He was sentenced to 20 years, but his attorneys said that both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream pussy, listened to his judgment on the cross with a crying look on the ground.
"His actions were killed by Conrad Royn," the prosecutor said.
"He decided to improve Conrad's life.
He hasn’t taken responsibility for the act,” the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't proved to be a punishment."
According to Carter’s attorney, the case was due to “the worse conditions that Carter deeply chased.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz believed that Carter’s “earth or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions.”
The prosecutor read the statement by Conrad's mother Lynn Roy, in which my mother said, "I didn't take a day to suffer the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can survive this, and I try to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always carry.”
Conrad’s sister Camdy Roy told the court that she was “only” the idea that she would never see her brother’s wedding or be a grandmother to her children.
"It's painful to lose a man who has been in my life every day since my birth. That pain never hurts," Camdy said.
The case appears to be a preliminary case, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the car as a wedding poison in 2014.
The case drew the national attention when it appeared that Carter in his text messages had motivated his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"I don't know, there are many habits," Carter wrote in many messages she had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was at that time on vacation with her family.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was paying attention to Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter would not benefit from the case by making interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of a British roommate in Italy in 2007, and was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox’s commentary in which he stated: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, no prison.”
NATO Secretary-General: The worst of Russia since the Cold War
The NATO military alliance with Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in Ukraine’s conflict.
I think that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now harder than ever since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal connection to Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia’s Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that the tensions will not climb at its top.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can go to a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the emergence of the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump could note that the U.S.-Russia was even dangerously bad.
Trump urged to thank the country’s poor congress that adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the experience of car manufacturers
The day before Audi announced, BMW offered updating more than 350,000 car software.
BMW’s leader said the company believed that “there are more reasonable options than driving restrictions.” He referred to European cities, including BMW’s hometowns in Munich, considering restriction or prohibition of use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would make changes to more than three million Mercedex engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about the return.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States to achieve CO2 emission objectives.
Diesel engine emissions are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralizing equipment are rising, making it difficult for cars to be priced competitively.
German car manufacturers are strictly monitored, and Allied Chancellor Angela Merkel is accused of the involvement of major car companies and denial of problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen errors. Volkswagen installed fraud equipment in cars to reduce emissions in tests according to the rules. Over the course of the course, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director responsible for the thermodynamics of the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was conducted in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed in their cars a system that could turn European emission requirements. The accusation was based on a similar study in the United States.
Audi’s investigation can significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the percentage of the luxury car manufacturer’s gains of Volkswagen are relatively high.
Venezuela's voting starts a deceased examination, large demonstrations allowing
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of the company, which has no role in the election result, President Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro convinced the crisis to end
In Venezuela, a representative was elected in a disputed vote on Sunday to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organized protests against its change.
The opposition against Maduroa has delayed its own demonstrations so that they would be in place at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, national security forces began local time on Wednesday evening to take over the country's parliamentary building.
The forces are intended to ensure the safety of the nomination.
Climate change threatens Provence lavente
The lavente list has become a symbol of the Southern France Provence region, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Laventeli had decreased due to the dryness and disease-bearing insects. Scientists and farmers are warmly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventeli is a direct threat in the region of Provence because it has suffered in recent years from the impacts of climate change, with which the rainfalls in the spring and especially in autumn have clearly decreased," said Eric Chaisse, a CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence.
"This reduces the life of the lavente.
In addition, dryness has brought to the region a lot of small scales that spread microbacteria."
Bets are hard.
Lavente oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desirable ingredient in fragrance waters and cosmetics.
"Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or are missing completely," said Chaisse.
“In other words, the essential oil-containing components are less.”
The solution is searched to improve the fertilization, slow down the dirt of the soil, and inject plants with a protective soap and water mixture. In addition, dryness is developed for more durable varieties.
Reporter's assassination reveals growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the Riodoce magazine once a week usually meets on Wednesday to discuss how the newspaper addresses the latest cases relating to organized crime, corrupt authorities and infinite nomination in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security due to a recent tragedy.
Reporters are invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists will discuss who is safer: leaving children home or taking them with the delivery of a crane attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters for names in each group. There is no need for evidence, observations and feelings are sufficient.
On the table, the names of drug dealers, politicians, entrepreneurs and journalists who are suspected of having a government or drug cards wages, are criminals who make news news of the chaos of Mexico to a life-threatening danger.
Violence is unstoppable, and more and more of the attacks are journalists. According to the Protective Committee of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto entered office in December 2012 in the federal protection of 589 states of journalists who have been subjected to attacks and threats.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, Riodoc founder, journalist and source of innovation.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply grafted, even though he is present everywhere. The Riodoc's building's headquarters cover a huge picture, where Valdez looks a middle finger. The picture reads: "Reality". Three-quarters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have dressed in T-shirts, decorated by the hills of Valdez' smiling faces. Valdez
The meeting is held less than two months after the death of Valdez. Reporters are discussing their common trauma, sorrows, insomnia, and fears of persecution.
The Federal Prosecutor’s Office was established in 2010, in particular for the treatment of reporters’ cases, but, according to the Reporter’s Protection Committee, only two charges have been raised so far.
Reporters kill only rarely, as well as thousands of crimes related to drug trafficking and organized crimes, only rarely ends in justice.
Riodoc reporters will continue to write about the violence of Sinaloa, although they are sadly broken and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, there is only a little benefit from the security meeting because the killers are not known and there is no hope for the right.
“This meeting is just a waste of time,” he says.
“We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know why this happens.”
Valdez had left Riodoc's delivery in the state capital of Culiacan in the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had only traveled on a red Toyota for a couple of cards, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The amount is supposedly associated with the newspaper's name: Riodoce means the twelve river.
The shooter drove out of Valdez's car and cook it somewhere away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He died of his wife and two adult children.
The mouths move quickly and move freely in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a mouse crash.
Sinaloa has been Mexico's bloodiest fighters since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled in the United States in January, and the competitors want to fill the empty.
On Sinaloan streets, someone or several people are shot dead every day, and the cemetery has the decorative two-storey cemetery buildings of drugs, which are larger than many homes.
In the coastal state, there is a “calm” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was very aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoc, the 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a competitive group that is going to war against Guzman’s sons.
This might be angry with Guzman’s sons: suspicious customers as members of the jengi purchased the magazine every number as soon as the magazine came to the sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdezia was not forced to leave the country after the second issue issued by the same issue became the subject of an attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murders are considered a reversal in violence against journalists.
He had survived so much that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear him.
He had made a long career in Noroest when he decided to establish in 2003 with five colleagues in Riodoc, which was sold for $50 at the time.
"It was impossible to make journalism without dealing with a drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest about its stories, and its sales and advertising volumes grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-class studying journalism without fear of censorship, and readers admired in the newspaper things that nobody else would dare to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom award from the Journalist Protection Committee to follow the Mexican drug trade story without sensitivity.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the award of the journalists' protection committee.
The drug deal is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez told Rompeviento in an interview with TV last October.
“The reporter must take a task that falls on him – or plays a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me where I was when death was bathed here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
The staff of Riodoc are missing Valdezia – a joke who was cursed as a portman. They are missing a friend who has always received mercy and advice. They are missing a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted her routines.
He's always used panama.
He went to the opposite delivery bar in El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines have experienced his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how they can best do their work and survive.
“The criminals do not like it if we deal with their wives and their children and their pure businesses, their secrets of drug trade.
They were left out of the matter,” Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-sense and self-protection,
Confidence on your own instincts.
If it feels like everything isn't in the face, we have to stay away.
According to Riodoc’s journalist Andres Villarreal, the problem is that “the impact can be fraudulent, and that’s what happened in the case of Javier.”
The old rules are no longer applicable in Sinalo, nor are they applicable in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive secrecy routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The environment is constantly changing.
The phones were not allowed to be brought into a room where Riodoc’s security training was held. A few days earlier it had been revealed that only the spy programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and suppliers in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers were applied to the shadow of the wood to protect 40 degrees from the heroes.
The Government of the State had ordered them to guard Riodoc’s offices located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan region.
Some of the journalists counted half of their games, whether these two policemen were among the 50 percent, which the governor of the state did not consider to be reliable.
It had been months since the reporters had visited the rulership of the angels in the mountainous rural.
This week's Riodoc's delivery was made up of three main steps.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinalo.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s use of money had focused on the hometowns of the governor.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a card away from the prosecutor's office, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official knowledge of who had been kidnapped and how, so it was necessary to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in the popularity of both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered under the name of a political party belonging to an institutional revolutionary party (PRI). PRI has managed Mexican policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in cases of publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write the previous cases in the same place, and one of them was Guzman's son, El Chapo, who managed to escape and avoid the ride of the army.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would receive reliable information about the kidnapping of Valdez’s column.
"We would have already known what had happened," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received a blast due to his body structure, the favorite name "El Flaco", Ohukainen.
"Now all our connections with our data sources are over."
The workroom of Valdez has been transformed into a warehouse that preserves colds and bars against suppliers’ persecution. The paper’s employees have gained a new, unexpected task: they have become press-free activists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez said the next morning, when he left the village, took a protest to the local prosecutor's office, which was again the murder of a new reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the murder of Valdez in the west of Michoacanin.
After the extinction, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests made by the authorities, Adame.
Reporters have begun to protest more voiced throughout the country. The texts of "SOS Press" are displayed on footwear and buildings.
Today, President Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support to investigate the Valdes case.
On the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing reporters because they told the truth.
He has then asked him to be removed from the matters dealing with the government, because he is worried that he is not able to be objective in his hatred.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organized crime, authorised crime authorities and an independent society.
In his last book, Narcojojournalism Valdez writes that turkeys kill journalists, but they are also killed by the command of politicians and security forces in consensus with criminals organized.
According to the Monitoring Group of Article 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were the time of police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are quiet by killing,” Ramirez says.
The murder has a devastating effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border country of Tamaulipas six years ago.
There was a message signed by the Zetas cardle to her body: "I am here for my writings."
Beside his cut head, there were computer keyboards and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to terminate their activities, such as El Norte magazine in the northern Chihuahua border state, writer Miroslava Breachin after the murder of March.
Some of his actions continue, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although his director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on his home page for the show: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have escaped from their states or across the country.
The decision is difficult.
The earthquake is difficult to find work, and it must be safe all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a journalist in their hands, as apparently visited photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he escaped Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra —which at the time had to be a novelist — admits that writing drugs is scared.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on the way to hell,” he says.
Some time ago, Riodoc’s journalists sat in front of the delivery on a beer floor on Friday midnight, when the latest number of the magazine was finished. Suddenly, their phones began to be a colorful sign of a message.
In the shooting between competing jeans and security forces at the Mazatlan coastal resort, 19 people died.
The war has accelerated, as was promised in the cardinal messages found in the area.
Reporters put news on Riodoc’s website from their footwear to their smartphones.
The first page was to be reinstalled the next day.
The Sirenes flooded nearby – again a new shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the shipping of guard police:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoc's delivery continued the tradition of the founder of the newspaper under this massive picture, where a man shows a middle finger to the whole Sinalo.
Bojorquez says, "How could I stop the newspaper when our coach asked to go to the street to do something the same day Javier was killed?"
The Hannu Mannisen Olympic project began with a huge backbone - "Hard Place"
In April, Hannu Mannisen’s celebration, at the age of 39, remained short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympics.
However, the exercise period began disastrously when Manninen got sick of flu.
It started a long period of illness that was used for almost five weeks.
In May, she was completely sick.
First, there was flu, and finally, such a pregnancy as an earliest inflammation that I had to eat antibiotics.
I was able to do only ten percent of the planned exercises.
I don't remember when the last time I was so painful for a long time.
It was a hard place when I didn't get a profitable training, Manninen tells the Night-Sanom.
Test result failed
The World Championship of 2007 was only licensed in the second week of June, which was shown at the KIHU's Rivalroad Research Centre on 12 June.
At the test, the athlete skis with wheels with a grid, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the athlete’s fingerprint on the needle to a milk acid sample.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the table, but now I stayed only 28 minutes.
It's fired against the wall, Mannine tells me.
In a better direction
After the beginning, Mannine tells her to remain healthy.
I have done a variety of quiet aerobic exercises that I have tried to normalize the metabolism of the body.
There is a really good five-week period behind me.
There was also a week and a half holiday in the airplane.
I also agreed to visit the house with my family.
Last season, Manninen only participated in four World Cup competitions before the Lahde Championships.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition, when Manninen rose to the top 18th.
Directions watered
Manny and team coach Petter Kukkonen have made an extensive training and competition plan until February.
We are now looking for a variety of rhythms compared to the last season.
After the Ensilume games, Ruka would have been a three-week World Cup weekend.
In December, it is intended to be involved at least one weekend in the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsa.
At the end of January, the plans would still be involved in Seefeld.
Hopefully afterwards, the name will be found on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
Pyeongchang Olympics would have been the six-year-old Winter Olympics for Mannsee.
Now, the main thing is to stay healthy, is the numelian submarine celebrated in the 2002 team competition in Salt Lake City.
The Dinosaur Protected by Namibia
At first, it looks scary.
Now, researchers have revealed the first research results from the discovery of a Canadian miner in the size of the cornerstone that was so well preserved that experts call it the dinosaurs Mona Sellei.
It had remained so well that researchers could even determine that its skin was red-brown and had a "problematic past".
According to the Current Biology magazine, it has the best preserved panshed dinosaurs and the best representatives of its species in the world.
Recently found fossils are nodosaurus, that is, in the middle of the period of the Union 110-112 million years ago.
Researchers consider this incredibly well preserved fossil as a really significant discovery.
According to the journal National Geographic, the plant plant plants have been mostly preserved in their species.
It was found at Suncor Millenium in North Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was found by Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding stone, and decided to explore its findings more accurately.
The fossil found in the stone was sent to the Royal Paleontology Museum of Tyrrel.
There, the fraud was exhibited for six years by 1 100 pounds of blockage.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you're sitting your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrel.
“It remains in science as Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs in history.
Skin studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this plant workers, although it had a pansher and it resembled a walking pansher.
Its red-white panzer seals it from its hunters, and also protects it from a darker and lower color, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was able to better confuse its environment and avoid the enemy’s larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus rose to the titles in May, and is now exhibited at the Royal Paleontology Museum of Tyrrel.
According to Mark Mitchell, the researchers named it Borealope Markmitchelli Museum Technik Mark Mitchell, a team that took more than 7,000 hours of mining dinosaurs.
Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shapes of its body’s pencils and panzers.
They found that it was protected in the animal world by still a general coloring, where the body is off darker and lower color.
However, the observation was a surprise because Borealope was significantly larger than current animals with similar colors.
It can conclude that the meat-eating dinosaurs have absorbed it to the extent that evolution is popular as a survival method of hiding instead of fighting.
Today’s animals, for example, have a similar coloring with pearls, seeds and armadiles. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, indicating that nodes were seriously threatened.
“The capture of a large, strongly pansized dinosaur tells how dangerous the alliance dinosaurs were,” Brown says.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the nodosaur in the nodes reveals that its skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur to make conclusions about its life, including studying the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate at its last meal.
The researchers believe it fell to the river when it died and went to the sea where it climbed to the sea ground.
Albert was at that time as warm as in Florida, and the rivers and seas probably expanded much longer than today.
“This nodosaurus is really significant because its fine skin has been preserved and it has also remained three-dimensional in its original form,” Brown notes.
“It looks almost the same as in the early period of the Union.
It doesn’t require much imagination: if you spray a little eye, you can almost believe it was asleep.”
The compound was the era of the teropodes, the vast two-square, the era of meat-cancer dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, i.e. millions of years ago Borealope, its great predecessors have been able to capture this panshed dinosaur.
One of the predecessors of the rex was, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of about 11.5 meters long six tonnes.
The latest findings of Nodosaur researchers have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealope was screaming to the sea after his death and mumiated to the mute.
It was found at Suncor Millenium in North Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was found by Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it has the world’s best preserved pansarated dinosaur from its leather and pansarain to its bulbs.
The nodos were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
They had two and a half feet of pigeons.
Scientists believe that this pansaceous vegetarian was passing through the current Western Canada until the river flood to its open sea.
Its depositary has kept small details in the late sea grave.
Its fossilized residues have remained so well that its skin is still left in the stamps of the pantry along its slope.
Michael Greshko also wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a stay is “one of the rare as a lot of profit.”
The more accurately he looks at it, the more impressive it feels.
In the cupboards of its plate there is still a fossilized leather.
Its right forehead is in its village, five wings upwards.
I can also calculate the soil of its foot.”
How does an activist learn to answer the question: to whom the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was shocked on 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day before his home from St. Louis and sat on his airbnb bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school blood:
"The police just killed a 18-year-old, and his body is still in the street."
When he was shocked, he noticed that nobody else had posted the same information in his input, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
During his time, there were numerous feedback from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted about Michael Brown's death in real time, a white policeman who had shot an armed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user also posted a picture of Brown's invisible body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later on the same night, people told Canfield Drive that he was coming together.
Users posted pictures of police lockdowns and screaming people, as well as Brown's father himself, a man who was claimed to be the one who read: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell watched a real-time video in which the police stood in front of demonstrators with a kidnapping dog.
He also tells her to see a video in which another policeman shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell recalls.
“It wasn’t a murder we’ve already admitted to and could be called a typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry and wept.”
He stole his return home the next day.
The machine landed in the evening, and Ferrell went to bring her six-year-old daughter to her father and decided to leave Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years was a documentary film "Whose Streets?" made. It was received on its first night at the cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story about survival and mentality, love and loss, and strength and senselessness from the point of view of local people who went to call for answers to the streets.
When Ferrell traveled towards Fergusonia's flower cake and his daughter dressed in a crown with her, they went back to a discussion of "what is the way to live in black and where in conditions." They had spoken countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and it's not right."
“I couldn’t be with my daughter,” Ferrell said later.
“The events of this day are... the top of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow in it.
He must be prepared for activism and organizing, but he must also be known as the different levels and conditions of the experience of a black life, and he must be able to know what we have to do to free ourselves.
Although fortunately I have been able to protect him from cruel racism, he is still similar to other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I'd protect him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became the campsite of activists when they were waiting for information about the case and finally learned that police would not be charged.
From there Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in pockets and distributed them to demonstrators.
Ferrell gradually began to treat activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he says. When he studied at the University of Missouri in St. Louis Ferrell, he was the chairman of the Association of Nurse Students of the minorities. At that time he focused on food law and healthcare in black communities.
“I had no experience of organizing.
It just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met him in the evening address of Sabaah Folayan, Deputy Director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "will simply tell you what was happening."
Ferrell's mind's a doubt, he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use for?"
In the background of the suspicion, they were countless times when people appeared in the local community, usually whites, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and the cleverness.
"We've heard that those who were born and grown in Ferguson did not have a common sound," Folayan said in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism for some deceased prisoners.
Davis' partnership led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals, and the description group followed the events of Brown's shooting over the years.
“This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak,” Davis says.
“The most important thing to me was how local people are presented in the movie, because I’m presented in the same way.”
According to Folayan, it was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experiences because it was intended to show that in the national movement, "it is not a charismatic leader but a community," but Ferrell proved to be more transparent.
That’s why the document sees the surprising private half of Ferrella’s life, such as love and marriage.
"I've been quite downstairs," Ferrell laughs when she says how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human description of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell’s story once and again brings back to the center of the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement above," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to constantly fight with many breasts.
Black queer women have to endure everything.”
Folayan agrees: "Movement really maintains black women, among which there are a lot of queer women."
However, he stressed that Ferrell was not chosen to be a document "individual" due to his queer identity.
"He got energy to move," Folayan says.
"But there is no chance that he was in the front line. Black queer women live a lot of things at the operational point, and they have a lot of games.
His energy is translated from the white shirt.”
The news description groups have left Ferguson for a long time, but the community and police are still sharp.
Ferrell has another two-and-a-half-year conditional remains, and he has been sentenced to the defence of motorways.
His description of his home corners of social politics is short and central: "Miksotku."
However, he continues to rely on the insulation he learned outside Ferguson's streets three years ago:
“Our willingness is to fight our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our neck.”
Suitable equality: the artist creates pictures of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery, located in New York City, has a central exhibition room with faces—white, black and brown faces, which can be more accurately observed.
These 30 works are images made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on the DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning’s pocket and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he executed his 35-year sentence, and Manning was convicted of secrecy for the blowing of classified diplomatic lines on WikiLeaks website.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance was released on 2.8.2017.
It has two years of letter exchange between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, computer technology and art in its work. Manning is a transnational and career-leading fan whose jail sentence Barack Obama relieves his third office on the last day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning’s DNA algorithmically and created 30 formats based on his genetic data, although a slightly theoretical positioning on DNA data adaptability, multi-interpretation and the cause-sequent relationships behind interpretations and identity.
Chelsea Manning, from my birth to Bradley Edward, has openly told women that she had been similar to her since she was broken and she was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including infringement of spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
The manning sentenced to jail was only one picture: a sharp, black, selfie, with a distressed emotional manning sitting in the car at the driver's location. He has a platinum valley on his head, which became his character.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a large popular Stranger Visions project that he implemented in 2012.
He created pictures on the basis of criminal data, obtained DNA information, for example, about tobacco and rubbers, and created pictures of what people could have seen.
Then the artist received an email from the Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of him," Dewey-Hagborg told the new exhibition at the news conference.
Manning's house was unable to visit and couldn't describe him in prison, so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a Manning DNA picture.
The artist and his other imprisonment suddenly became friends for the exchange of letters, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a series of Suppressed Images, which was depicted by Shoili Kanungo, which describes the future in which the president would have relieved Chelsea's judgment and he could watch the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence only a few days after the release of the series, which was a chance after seven years of punishment in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now when Donald Trump goes on to his own war against data and transgender soldiers and invents on Twitter ever new ways to strengthen those strong wartimes he had to actually relieve.
Dewey-Hagborg believes "everybody has their purpose."
The gallery wall has the opinion of an artist and under Manning's great name, where the point of the native's name is the heart. In his opinion, the artist requires the end of "automatic sharing, on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
The opposite wall has Manning’s DNA period: a long ion of C, G and A letters in the lyrics.
This 200 letters, or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist, combined with Dewey-Hagborg, wants to figure out how similar we are to all of us, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my exhibit helps people understand that we are equivalent to our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and transparent to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells countless stories. There are 30 of them here."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg’s series.
Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong, with a megaphone.
"If they get you calmed down, they have won," the picture reads.
"Never be silent."
"The text is a letter I received from Manning," the artist from Philadelphia says.
“It’s so impressive that I still get cold colors.”
Unlike what was described in the series, Manning has not yet seen the show. When Manning arrives, he is greeted by his own genetic data-based faces as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the showroom.
It is intended, like all other in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA period has been written on a sharp height that is the same as its length (157.5 cm).
“The plants were earlier on the wall, but I wanted to bring them a crowd of people to feel,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
"I wanted to describe the band movement born by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
Professor at Northwestern University and employees at Oxford University are searched for murder suspects
Police reports their launch of national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University suspected of killing a man dead in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook's district court documents show that on Monday, arrest orders were issued by Wyndham Lathe, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of participating in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea's death.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after he had been tied several times.
According to a local newspaper published by the Chicago Police Agency, the body was found on 27.7.2017.
Police warned about the Grand Plaza building found a victim with a number of wounds in their bodies.
According to the officials, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene, and the murder was investigated, and the police were actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Deputy Director for Social Relations at the University, Alan K. Cubbage, said in his email statement that Lathem is now free of charge and is forbidden to access the campuses at the University of Northwestern.
"This is a crime investigated by the authorities, and the Northwestern University helps investigate," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
In a statement sent by the University and Somerville College by e-mail, "we have been in contact with police in the UK and are ready to assist the U.S. case-checking authorities in all possible ways."
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would give up.
Chief of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he called for suspects to give seriously to the authorities.
“The police have an understanding of their place, and we are constantly accuracy of our researchers,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will help in the search of suspects.
He told a police call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an inadequate tip that something had happened in the 1008 apartment.
Police described the appearance of the event as terrifying.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the victim was killed on the same day or earlier.
He told the security cameras that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Lathami and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Headquarters issued a press release to the residents: “The police are currently investigating the passage and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
The man threatened to explode Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” he said.
Moffatt must carry out a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced to exploding the Islamic library store in London and "killing all Muslims".
According to the Independent newspaper, David Moffatt was convicted of serious disturbance.
According to the police, the staff of the book store warned them on 23 May.
According to the staff, the man had "intended to explode bookstore and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the trade after threats.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police to threaten.
The threat was not associated with bookstore events.
The authorities noted that Moffatt had been dressed in the same house as a suspect of bookstore events, police officer said.
I am not an anti-Muslim, I am a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in the interviews.
As a penalty, a man must carry out a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay about 620 pounds, i.e. the legal costs of EUR 690 and 85 pounds, i.e. the compensation of EUR 95 to the victims.
According to Scotland Yard’s reporter, several hatreds will be left unreported.
"We will take action in accordance with WADA's ticker in the near future" - Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko
Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete actions under the WADA World Anti-Doping Authority’s charter to restore Russian anti-doping committee’s powers.
"A part of the measures under the charter have already been taken, and RUSADA has been entitled to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD British Antidoping Commission.
"WADA's card has been updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA’s charter, which defines the conditions for the return of RUSADA’s mandate. The second part of the charter was recently published on the organization’s website.
But it does not contain anything worried about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything is done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” Mutko added.
However, one of the targets requires the Russian antidoping authorities to publicly accept the results of a Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren’s investigation by WADA. McLaren investigates the state’s alleged role in Russian doping.
Munko said: “The investigation is in ongoing because our antidoping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit anything that wasn’t there.”
In the statement, the President of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Committee, Vitaly Smirnov, was a statement.
Speaking to the Russian RSport sports media on the same day, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems in the Russian antidoping agencies. "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We will not accept the report without condition,” he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015 when the scope of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate the test under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA’s director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA’s headquarters in Moscow in July, and after his visit, he stated that the organization was “right way” to restore powers.
British organization as a skeptical Finnish loving innovation: "There is no evidence for the health benefits of maternal packages"
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish motherhood packages.
The BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust organization that fights the swallowing schools prohibits the use of its own presentations in the UK’s maternity packages.
The distribution of maternity packages for all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
The packaging is also distributed in some areas in England.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity pack would reduce the risk of death injury.
The death of a baby means an unexplained death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust serves as an expert in the UK healthcare authorities to ensure a child’s safe sleep.
We will no longer let package our official presentations on them because it would make it clear that we recommend this product, the organization said.
In Finland there is one of the lowest children’s deaths in the world, only two thousand dead per birth.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is a result of a number of different reasons, such as a small number of teenagers.
The fact that there is a box for each family can be one factor.
However, this can’t be said with certainty,” said Lullaby Trust CEO Francine Bates.
We are worried that maternity packaging is marketed as products that reduce child mortality and injury.
Motherhood packaging is a Finnish invention, and it has been given free to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the packaging.
The packaging itself is a carton in which the child can be placed to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, its shared boxes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says there are no safety standards for cowboys as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no validity or surface bed available.
The system recommends using the pack only for days and stop using it at the time when the child is able to turn.
The system also recommends that pets be taken away from the packaging and ensure that it does not crash or crash.
The rider escaped from the Japanese Zoo
The staff of the Japanese Zoo is looking for a quarantine.
He has been surprised at the speed of the staff and has been repeated for two weeks.
The race escaped from the Shibukawan Zoo in Okaya, west of Japan on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the car left the zoo through the entrance.
It doesn’t die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we’re very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, working in the zoo, said.
A 35-year-old chariot is feminine, 55 pounds long and about meters long.
Yamane describes the escape quietly and softly.
At the time of the night, the wheel can be free to pass in the area of preciseness.
The zoo hasn't had any eye-catching choices.
The last trip happened next week.
Yamane found an escaped walk on the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked for help from my colleague, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we can ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid Uber errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in the startup online store company, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often uncertain, useless or even misleading.
Although he convinced that the inquiries were anonymous, some of the employees treated them doubtless.
"They were simply not consistent and not objective," Errett says. Madison Reed, a hair care company, focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to rely on external assistance.
The markets have become more and more new types of staff management startup companies that help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure the commitment of employees, which can make surveys and target them to certain teams and population groups, and provide their employees with unnamed reporting services and, in some cases, direct contact with the governance.
"You can monitor your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where are companies delaying Fitbit?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint Staff at Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint offers companies analytical software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years. He tells her to get a deeper view of her employees’ thoughts and feelings.
The program can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams. It can also draw up a map from one point of view which departments are the most satisfied and which managers have received the weakest reviews. On this basis, Errett has been able to break down the cores of the problems.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the culture of work so that they do not become the next Uberia. The transport company has been scared since the former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are troubled and are punished with problems.
For startups like glycin, such negligence is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate management, regulation and compliance are a global sector with the value of the Let's Talk Payments website to rise to more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, located in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent unauthorized use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation experienced collapse.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently made an agreement with Uber.
As with Glint, Convercent allows companies to make custom queries, collect confidential answers in real time and map issues.
In addition, employees may notify anonymously of irregular behaviour by text message.
And if the director is accused of doubts, the complaints go directly to the government of the company.
"The general opinion has dismissed the authorities," says Convercent’s founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He reminds us that if the company treats its employees badly or acts irrelevantly, the consequences may become expensive even if the authorities do not miss it. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it may also lose employees and become a challenged right.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 offices. The company has been using Convercent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the principles and procedures and easily get connected to the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address he was able to make the notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” says Ruby Tuesday’s lawmaker James Vitrano, who said the complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now, problems like discrimination, anxiety and unfair wages can be detected and addressed faster.
“I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of an employee,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from your legal proceedings related to employment relationships.
According to Quinlan, companies began to be treated more and more seriously with ethics, values, and commitments to employees after the audit company Arthur Andersen broke down as a result of an ethical activity in connection with the Enron scandal.
Only with the social media, companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public examination of their liquor.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to ethics control,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service that is charged on a regular basis.
This is a business model and opportunity approved by capital investors, both Glint and Convercent are supported by capital investors.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, a total of $47 million.
In November, Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and collected a total of $60 million funding.
Investments are not a surprise, taking into account the relationship between companies, corporate culture and risk capital.
According to a number of researches, employees expect more from their workplace earlier.
In the competitive markets like the Pila Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“The employees are stronger committed to the company’s success if they enjoy the company and feel that they are listening to them and that their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, CEO of LinkedIn.
Investors get profits when companies are successful. Businesses are successful when employees are committed.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is not surprising that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, the knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if it does not take action.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it may be considered a sign of change.
And if the change does not become fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of employees.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to attend four thousand discussions,” says Kotter International, CEO of Kotter, Russell Raath, who has seen the company’s trustworthiness to collect only information.
“If the company does not take action, employees begin to wonder whether they will be heard.
And it doesn’t matter in their opinions.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Madison Reed, it is currently working with staff every month and is able to address the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from the slow decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help improve the sustainability of their employees in a long-term sector known for the great variation of their employees.
“If the company is not committed to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees,” Vitrano says.
“If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
Without customers there are no businesses.”
A 20-year-old man in Sweden is suspected of encrypting his naked female necklace, reports the news agency TT.
A woman living in Göteborg had gone home from the shower when she noticed outside her window laughing at a laugh.
According to the woman, the mobile camera pictured the apartment.
The woman who had been arrested had gone into another room to dress up.
When the woman came to check the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but soon afterwards it was recalled into the window.
A 20-year-old suspect has admitted his image to a woman.
However, he only imagined the faces of a woman.
The video described in the run was removed and the police hadn't managed to restore it as a proof.
In the interviews, a man admitted the act, but forbidd his accused of crime.
The man described him had been justified by saying that he loved his neighbor as “a crazy one.”
According to the news agency TT, a man is accused of the case.
Teachers need more luxury in autumn negotiations
The wage may not be lower than for example in the export industry, but the difference should be reduced, OAJ President Olli Luukkainen said Thursday.
The temporary cutting of the public sector holidays emphasizes the difference, he notes.
We do not have the possibility to conclude agreements in which the review does not involve vacation operations in any way.
In the municipal sector, agreements will only be issued once the papers of the private sector have been signed and the rates are clear.
It is important to predict that, for example, the working conditions of OAJ have been agreed in January.
The percentage goals have not yet been revealed.
It is also the president of Juko of the trained public negotiations organization.
Category: Holiday surgery increases dignity development
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a weakening of the procurement power of public-sector employees while increasing the procurement power of the private sector.
According to the class, the periodic holiday cutting will further rotate the dignity developments.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also notes that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the best and weakest differences are growing all the time.
According to the system, learning results are weakening and the differences between students and regions are constantly growing.
I held Bruin's player's day when the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
A team of American football players at UCLA have left to talk to the second floor of the new training fields of the campus.
Some have cut off their toys, and their backs are shining from the mosquito after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this conversation rate for a few minutes is a midnight break.
At the University’s summer courses, players return to their final tests after three hours of training, and the next morning they meet half of the seven Wasserman Football Center.
“The next three days will be tough for these friends,” Bruins’ coach Jim Mora says a little before Monday’s shift to Tuesday.
The university tournament’s rooftop organization has reduced the number of daily exercises together from two, with the aim of reducing the number of players’ work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, until the final tests are held.
Therefore, the first three exercises of the UCLA began guarding over seven nights, and it was difficult for players to find space from the full schedule.
Restricting the exercise rates one day means that the exercise days are more earlier. This year the camp began almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time Mora's six-time training period is continued in Westwood when the exercises are held simultaneously with summer courses.
Exercises will be held 18 times before August 20, and then the real preparation for the season’s opening session begins: UCLA will meet the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she has supported NCAA's regulations, although it has made players' schedule even more stricter.
“We really load them a lot for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But players are ready to work. They are good friends.
I think the situation will make it easier when we arrive on Saturday, and then we have more time.
UCLA closes exercises from outside the camp. It is not easy to take into account the direct views from the exercise field to the parking area and Luskin Center, a luxurious hotel, which has already been bombarded with a protective network of football flying over the painter.
Bruins players are intended to move to the hotel for the next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may occur during the season when rooms are available outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and out there describe exercises for the video. It is not an overwhelming concern.
For the exercises described in the video, it is paid a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to worry too much about this.
We have a plan."
Freedom of Rwanda
In Central African Rwanda, presidential elections will be held on Friday, whose winner will be held clear.
Paul Kagame has officially strived for its third season, but in practice he has influenced the leadership of the country since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF stopped the massacre of extremists.
Kagame was the RPF commander.
Kagame has been evaluated, among other things, by breaking the opposition and limiting freedom of expression.
He was also accused of misconducting poverty statistics.
For the third season, Kagame is able to strive because the two-second constitution of the Presidency was amended.
However, Kagame is also a real leader in Rwanda.
During his time, social reforms have been made in Rwanda and international investments have flown into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in the merger of the country divided by the people murder.
The success of Ruanda has led many Africans to ask whether the liberal multilateral democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagame has promised to his people more freedom after the country has been raised to his feet.
Now it could be a good time to start.
Facebook Fights Fake News By Enhancing Facts Checking
Facebook plans to send possible fake news to independent fact-inspectors increasingly and to show the results below the original article. The world’s largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company has published an opinion on its website that it begins to use updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been reviewed as the largest spreaders of fake news. Many believe that fake news has influenced the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has emerged in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed by false voters before the presidential election in May and preparing for the election in September, Germany supports a plan to defeat social media if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
In a separate statement published in Germany, Facebook announced that the facts were tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see what stories do not pass through the sweat of independent auditors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more selectively what they read and share," said Sara Su, product head of Facebook, on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test articles related to the subject and make other changes to its news entry to reduce fake news.
The birth of a series: The story of a castle
Little Scotney's town in Kent County is now known for Squeezen's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of storm history. Now, this charming castle in the Bewlin River Valley is a subject for a serial book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moppist writer in the old documents.
“I think it’s great to study the text written by the deceased over 300 years ago,” Rhodes says.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families in Scotney from the Middle Ages of the Edvardians. Each story has been imagined by a different artist, promising British serial photographer: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book based on the archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared to him, whose inspired sources were the documents of the British national library. The project was emotional.
"I moved to the tears when I noticed in my letter a footprint, a letter written by a dual agent working on Jagobits in the 17th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell smoke, because it was then used as a lighting of fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the ground.
I love the archaeologists!"
An old writer who was taken to the documents was able to live in the castle for nearly four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which seemed too good to be true, and he admitted that he had not been able to stay in the castle immediately for a little longer than he had been wished.
He spent days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archipelagoes, treasures, and rareties, such as bottles in the valley for centuries.
He walked through the ruins and orders of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists imagining books.
In the evening, he got whiskey and started writing.
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown because the castle was completely moved to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heritage Elizabeth Hussey in 2006.
When Rhodes came to the place ten years later, the staff of the foundation had only started through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years in the same method: carrying all the extra to the pool.
In the archives there were journals, letters from time to time of the English empire, and maps of whoever possessed anything. "You could imagine that the landscapes are boring," Rhodes says. "But here families fought even one of the hardships.
I thought it wouldn’t have been.”
Some of the stories of the book go on from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells about a man who soon after his graduation of the castle was associated with England's homework in 1381.
"Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex" says the castle had noise in 1380," Rhodes says.
"As the English housekeeper began in the same area, and he realized that the defeat could start with noise.
Maybe these events are related to each other?”
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, the story of the priest, which the family of Darrell had seven years in the course of the English religion.
The Smuggler again tells the 17th-century story of the mysterious driver Arthur Darrell. He is told that he had made his own cemetery by filling the ark with stones (which was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrels are Rhodes' favourite family in Scotney. "The family men seemed to have been pretty transporters. They were constantly debtors and bought things they wouldn't have had.
The men of the family of Darrel solved their debts by marrying the wealthy elders, and I saw them as good friends who were able to shake herds."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a series book about Life, a restaurant that worked in the early 20th century, from which there is no more but a soil.
Scotney's castle has a special place in her heart.
“It was sad to leave,” she says.
"I wouldn't want to go back to this evil ark yet."
The worst of Russia since the Cold War
The NATO military alliance with Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in Ukraine’s conflict.
I think that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now harder than ever since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal connection to Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia’s Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that the tensions will not climb at its top.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can go to a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the emergence of the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump could note that the U.S.-Russia was even dangerously bad.
Trump urged to thank the country’s poor congress that adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops - Renewal against Anthony Joshua won't take place
The long-term world champion Vladimir Klitshko ended his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Klitshko scored 69 times as a professional and won 64 matches.
He held various championship titles between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley's stadium and lost after a striking match in the 11th section.
Joshua and Klitshkon were expected to meet in a renewal contest in Las Vegas in November.
Nevertheless, Klitshko did not find motivation for the game.
I used to make a decision for a few weeks to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko said in a statement.
As a amateur and professional craftsman, I got everything I had to do, and now I want to start my second career after a sport.
I would never have imagined that I would have had such a long and incredibly successful crash.
I am very grateful for it.
See Klitshkon's reasons for his decision in the video.
Klitshko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been married to U.S. actor Hayden Panettieren since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter of Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshkon’s grandfather Vitali is also the former world champion of the heavy series.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the championships of the various associations at the same time.
Finland's weather shooter meets the conditions: "Export from the file"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
Wind and cold have been taken from a woman.
There are also instability conditions in the London Championships.
Gonna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The incidents have been in the summer of the Minna Nikkas.
I wouldn't want to blame the wheel, but it was unconceivable that I didn't even get the small wheels to move properly," Nikkanen said after the kitten in Innsbruck.
I have competed and practiced here know how many stages I have never experienced in this place with a varied wind, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, the standardization of the hype has been really difficult, as there have been so instability winds in exercises, Nikkanen found Kaleva in the battles.
The weather was also spoken on Thursday in London.
It's been very difficult to get the technology in the box - whether it's cooling or something.
It's been cold and wind, and it's taken out of the file.
There is no reason to consume energy in poor conditions.
He won 455 championships thanks to his winners.
There are 445.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You need to be a bitch and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday.
Why don’t you work abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump in the box and engineering standardized.
I should have done the same now.
Normally, the government has been trained, and now the government has been arrested.
What would be the perfect game?
25 degrees warm.
The wind is small as long as it is standard.
An experienced ex-functionary politician reassured politicians: "We have nothing to divide now and for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipilà must remain in the shade and be warned of the disruption of the state budget by debt, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets for decades in the Ministry of Finance.
He says there is no division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed the retired Electricity at the 1st of the week.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, the political leaders have put forward the proposals on the lifting of a guarantee pension, the calculation of car taxes and the support of electric bicycles.
They mostly tell us that elections are beginning to be close, because when ten percent of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have nothing to share now and for many years.
I think it's even a fraud to talk about the division when the debt is taken, Virtanen told Yl.
The current emphasizes that all debt is debt to children.
It has a long experience in the preparation of state budgets: it began in 1978 as Secretary of Budget at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Chief and Deputy Chief of the Department of Budgets.
Later, before retirement, he served as Chancellor of the Ministry of Labour and Business.
In an interview with the Power, it noted that the forecast economic growth of 3 percent is now likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a pigeon from which we are going to go to the downstairs next year, and Finland is expecting one percent growth for decades.
Washington amends permanent residence permit rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said the Green Card's rules would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to counteract the requirements of temporary work permits and to restrict family visas.
New rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill must be discussed in two Congress rooms.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money by changing the way that permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
“The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to live themselves and have useful skills in our economy,” Trump said.
The wife of the queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margarita.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareeta were described in April.
Queen Margareeta, 77, and her husband, Prince Henry, 83, are not buried next to her, says the Danish hobby.
Traditionally, the governors in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The Royal Room has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde's courtyard, the Hovi said on Thursday.
According to the BT newspaper, this is the cause of the princess' unsatisfiedness in her role in the royal family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the dance monarchy, Hov's communications chief Lene Belleby commented in the newspaper.
The decision to the princess not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with his spouse.
According to Hov, the queen has long been aware of the desire for her husband’s funeral and understand the decision.
Horror moment on the road: The car was coming up on the highway
Tommi had an open room and two small children.
They did not injure in the accident, but they did not receive insurance money if the other party was not targeted.
The storm occurred at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
archive from the construction work of Kehä III.
Vantalian Tommi tells his family that he survived on Tuesday a miracle of a trade in a car accident.
Tommi, his cousin, Riina, and the couple’s two small children were driving on the highway towards Keimolan Port in Vanta Hämeenlinna.
From the adjoining of the III to the Hämeen City Army, he was driving a white car that was driving a family car, Tommi says.
Without the army movement, the car would have come up with Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it left the hands, Tommi told me.
The family’s car hits with a high speed of protection.
The parents and two young children in the back were not injured.
One of the children is a little under the age of three, the other under the age of one year.
It was obviously a good time when nothing happened to us.
None of us traveled even to us, even though there was a wild traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at about 17.20.
Tomma said no one stopped with them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got their own power out of the car.
The ambulance staff and the rescue facility arrived, and the family’s condition was revised.
The car went to the rescue.
Tommi tells him and his small revenue, and they received aid to buy a car a few years ago.
Without other car information, Tomm's family doesn't get the money from the insurance.
That’s why the family hopes for observations from the eyewitnesses from the car, which caused the family to be protected.
We need a car every day.
It’s hard to take children to care and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw the car was white, old car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 2000s.
He believes the beginning of the car registration number was SIG.
If the fault is not caught, I don't know how to manage financially, we'll now have to calculate each cent.
Tommi hopes that what happened or something knows about it is connected to the police.
The Police Office of East New Zealand and the Central New Zealand Rescue Office confirm that they had been in an accident place on Tuesday evening.
The title and talk repaired at 21:15: Unlike initially stated in the talk, another car, according to Tomm, did not come to rebuild the hosts, but was to drive from a speed-band to a family car.
Lotta Jäppise's presentation addresses human relations in the ways of humor - The Self-Developer is seen in the theatre What? Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, originating in the Cowboy, brings to the theater What?
The self-developer is a music theatre of the past human relationships and insufficientness.
The director Lotta Jäppies said that it still remains a good mind.
The subject is treated by the means of humor.
I don’t miss feelings, he says.
The touring summer theatre is carried out with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation challenges to think about what a person reveals himself when he discovers a new person.
Maybe he takes a role, or is he approaching another shirt open?
A beverage presentation mixs fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatised the presentation.
He is also responsible for lights.
The presentation is composed of the texts of the working group and does not contain any argument.
The director believes that although the presentation has a lot of thoughts on young people, it speaks of all ages.
Jeppinen stresses that the self-destroyer does not directly tell his own or the working group about human relations.
Facts and fiction are mixed.
My world of value is definitely about the show.
I don’t think that human relations would be bad, but I don’t think that human relations, especially a couple, would be a condition of luck.
A lot of students learn from parents
Jeppinen believes that the self-developer draws an actual picture of the young adults living in Finland, a hundred years old.
He says that many have learned a lot of human relations from their parents, many of whom have differed.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You don’t have to stay in bad relationship.
In the show, Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka are actors.
The work group also includes Ella Snellman.
The music agreement is Jappisen and Rokan.
Love in the theatre in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is a theatre-expression director at the University of Arts in Turku.
There are two years in the back and the front of the other.
The enthusiasm of the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The music classes have been an assistant at the Kouvola theatre and plays, among other things, at the University of Helsinki and the last of the Castle Theatre in the Market.
Management has begun to be more and more interested.
The suicide bomber got his last night at the Narr show in Helsinki.
A 45-minute presentation was seen in the future, at least in the Gypse City of Study in the market.
Theatre of Kouvolan What? at 4.8. 19 and 5.8. 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic player recovered for a year from a harsh motocrosson accident - the necklace broke
A few athletes in Finland are similar to the unstoppable nature of Janne Lahtela.
He traveled around the world for hundreds of days a year for ten years and pursued his dreams with an Olympics.
The incident took place in 2002, but Lahtela’s move continued.
He was not only a tired coach, but also a new species experimenter.
There are no exercises on the earth that a chemist would not have tried at least once.
It's excited to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one of them was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela suffered from a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklace and both hands were broken.
I wasn't at work.
I've been injured in my house a year, Lahtela says.
There was a bad luck on the late.
He also admits that the age may have been a part of his life.
Driving on the prey may sound fair.
But I didn't apply for these boundaries.
It's just so hard that the 40s like this don't have too much fun!
After the accident, Lahtela came into a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind the Japanese freestyle team was a long breakout as head coach.
Lahtela began the washing immediately after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time I was 15 years old, I had to be there.
I didn't really do anything, Lahtela tells me.
At the time of preparation, Lahtela often challenged her protection in breast and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stop was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my thoughts didn’t even feel reasonable.
Not even in the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I really just got it once.
The compulsory break initiated Lahtela Finland's chief coach.
Without a stop, he feared that he would have come back.
It is easier for the body to find places that have gone farther than forests!
Without an accident, I wouldn’t have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela began as Finnish freestyle team coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer entertainment for the drivers.
I replaced the motorcross frisbeegolf!
It just left the child right away.
The worst was seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-inspired coach, she does not require that she is able to be like her.
I don't force all in the same form.
In our class culture, there is room to be their own and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been consistent with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried.
It’s here: a report on technological developments in the sex robotics sector – just when it began to feel like 2017 could no longer become stranger.
Yeah, yeah.
Sex robots are a big thing.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within 5-10 years.
"We have to start to take seriously to the generalization of sex robots," said Noel Sharkey Sheffield University, the founder of the Foundation, robotics and emeritus professor of conduct.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the needles and the type of fingerprints.
"Sex robots are sharpened, but they're already sold a lot, and we're going to see them even more," Sharkey said.
Sexy skins have developed to be hot-featuring robots with silicone skin, as well as the characteristics created by the teaspoon that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences from the color of the eyes to the shape and type and color of the fingerprints.
This is also more worrying that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like advanced freedom fighters.
Sexually developed as robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, or to the gateway.
True Companion's Roxxxy Gold novel has a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems to play, Wild Wendy is adventurer and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user's personality," the company's website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It may be tired, in a conversation or in “the wind.”
The generalization of sex robots has many concerns. They replace real human relationships, but it is even more dangerous for women to undermine and direct rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a chassis and a resilient programmed robot.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to the vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
Sex robots, however, are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
The dissemination and development of them tells one of the darker and deeper in our culture: the tendency to gender equality towards gender interaction, where substitution is one of the alternatives among others.
Of course, most men don’t get sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot of time about the spirit.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only after the market permits it.
There is no chance that sex robots have begun to spread at the same time as women's rights are threatened across the world and a president sitting in the White House, who has embraced women's afflictions.
The Handmaid's Tale (Your Slave) is not the worst about its powerful image language, such as pictures of dirty bodies and out of dirty eyes. The most disturbant is how the world of the series feels realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but now it seems that there is a surprising short trip.
Sex robots are trying to make as many real women (pornstar ratios) as technically possible.
Robotics developers want their skin to feel real and movements trace human movements as well as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or the situation.
They don’t have their own will or history – nothing that refers to independence or perfect submission breaks the fantasy.
They are pleasant servants.
The slavery.
Police suspected that Australia planned two terrorist attacks, led by ISIS chief
The Chief of ISIS led a group of Australians who suspected that they planned to carry a bomb on the plane of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person who belonged to the leads of ISIS was also sending the bomb building parts to Sydney.
The suspects said the bomb was intended to be transported on July 15, but the company stopped before security checks.
Police don’t tell you why the company stopped.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas-separating device and export the device to a public place, for example, to a public transportation device.
The Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police prisons on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will also be continued.
Trump's good half?
Get Mitt Romney to look healthy inheritance
During Trump’s period, it has already been repeated to the fact that the strong half-time of voters has also destroyed families at the level of the arch.
On the roads of Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory balls for American newspapers were guided by how to deal with Trump’s voted relatives.
We all want our information cup to be relaxed.
At least, Trump’s ability to connect families has remained.
I'm telling you this because my cousin's villager was with me this week in New York, and he's a left-handed runner in Chicago, who has long been close to the rest of our family with the Republicans.
He reminded us that a joint enemy can have a powerful combined effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins, including the Republicans’ profitable sister with whom he has argued about politics for decades, are suddenly on the same side.
It’s a good thing at the dining table, but, more widely thinking, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given a new current to the left, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we talk about a terrifying possibility that one day we will no longer be afraid of his tricks.
In the long run, there is even a more terrifying chance that Trump will normalize the right extreme Republicans, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember Mitt Romney’s crazy version: Dog on the car roof, 14 percent income tax (and we have seen his tax statements), compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild infringements.
When Trump’s season is over, the next presidential condition of the Republicans needs to be clear, and it immediately feels a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the Central Park's carpet, the largest carpet in the New York Park department, and the best thing to get in New York with three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of the Karusell are huge, the characters in the midst – the wild clowns and the scary animals that look back in power – are bad, and the swinging music in the background is strangely fascinating.
A lot of New York’s identification boundaries are disappointed over time: views of high buildings begin to get tired, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar and the city’s reality doesn’t correspond to the dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not fully overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss house, but a large traffic cycle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it is not calculated.
Instead, the central park’s curve remains a strange mysterious life – even to the extent that two-year-olds, one of the eleven and two-fourty-year-olds enjoyed it enormously.
I would have given a full score to the carruse if someone had asked me to assess, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, this week I was asked to assess my "payment experience" at a level of one five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in the cafe with my home corners, but there is also the opportunity to combine 15% money with the estimated service when I go to pick up a coffee press myself.
This slows down the file’s interaction and presses the client to put his personal in a game situation where it is not necessary.
The seller of the store smiled as a regrettable condition when I tired of giving my credit card's five stars.
Shefki Kuqi has been kidnapped from Inter - "There was no leadership confidence"
FC Inter has released the roles of Shefki Kuq's follow-up team as coach.
Fabrizio Piccare, a former coach, is responsible for training.
Other training teams will continue their current tasks.
The Italian Piccare has previously served as an assistant coach in the English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccare, who joined the Interi training group, passed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, President of the FC Intern Government, regretted the incident.
Interchangeing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the follow-up leadership, where there was no other option now, Håkans commented in the follow-up newspaper.
The Piccaretan agreement is in force until the end of the period.
He is responsible, along with another training group, for the HIFK at the home competition tomorrow.
According to Sunami's reports, the team has been slaughtered on Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that I will follow the assistant coaches of Piccare and John Allen have been displaced.
Kuqi and Piccare joined in the Intern match against PS Chemistry last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture of the 80s – would you recognize a serious student?
Viuda artist Linda Lampenius published a youth photo on Instagram.
The picture has been added to several fans, based on which you can decide that the music is in the picture of a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius itself surprises a young woman looking at a serious camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's telling me.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of its past and also talked about painful topics.
A year ago, he posted a photo pair on Instagram.
In the second picture we see him 20 years ago, in the second he poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his image, Lampenius considers his own growth as a human and refers to eating disorders he suffered as younger.
It was 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to love myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text she had added in English hashtagit life, eating disorder, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-confidence, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is clear.
Lampenius has spoken openly about eating disorders in the past few years.
He was already in the hospital at the age of 14 because of anorexia and orthodoxes.
A little later, he also became ill with a bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
Healing began with a little bit.
In addition to therapy and comparison, new love helped from Lampeniu.
Oscar Pistorius was released from prison for breastfeeding
This is the second time Pistorius was taken out of prison to the hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care in his chains, which, according to prison authorities, he received after falling into the cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for the murder of the prosecutors for the original murder sentence.
He killed Steenkamp’s Friendly Day early in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door to his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius argued that he thought his girlfriend was a nightmare in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said they intend to complain again because they think Pistorius's six-year sentence is too slow.
The prosecutor will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint will be addressed possibly already this year.
If the complaint is accepted, Pistorius’ judgment may extend to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians are arrested for illegal camps in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the foreign ministry said by the bTV channel.
The police arrested a group of promised campers in Sithonia in the morning of August 1, among the campers were two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to TV channel bTV, the foreign ministry later announced its release of Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have stricted the rules for free campsites and have already given sensitive fines to all who are camped elsewhere than for purposes.
The inspections will be continued until the end of the season.
The ministry stated that the right to impose a fine.
The next share increases - decreased at -7.7%
The oil producer’s share of Nesteen has failed about 7.7 percent at 11 p.m.
Its result fell before taxes, but exceeded the prediction made by Inquiry Financial.
Today, the stock market has visited lightly on the side of the package, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritated intestinal syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the pressures of the digestive system.
However, a recent study argues the opposite: a diet that contains plenty of meat proteins and dairy products can facilitate the syndrome of irritated intestines.
An irritated intestinal syndrome is an unhealthy disease with about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK, causing stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential protein amino acid tryptophane helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal toleration.
According to the research leader Marco Colonna, immune cells are guarding the mushroom and ensuring that no harmful microbes in the food will enter the body.
The inflammation-causing cells balance the cells that strengthen tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, as a result, it can be an irritated intestine syndrome.
Tests have found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance have mice with certain bacteria in the intestine.
This bacterium requires tryptophan to begin immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the protein building materials.
"We had a connection between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiomy of the intestine," says Professor Colonna.
“The more the mouse diet had tryptophans, the more they had such immune cells.”
If the same functions in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a rich diet that contains tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
When studying the immune cells that strengthen the tolerance, the researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraga found that although one mouse group had such cells, they did not have the same type of mouse mouse that was held separated from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was associated with microbiomes in the gastrointestinal system, i.e. with the normal community of bacteria, fungus and viruses.
When the mouse's DNA was studied, six types of bacteria were detected in those mouse with immune cells but not in other mouse.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given to mice grown in a sterile environment with no intestinal microbiome and no immune cells, immune cells began to occur to them.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They cultivated Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquids and transferred small amounts of liquids – without bacteria – to mice isolated into immune cells.
Immune cells developed into cells to strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as the indol-3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophan in mice nutrition, the number of cells that strengthen the tolerance increased by about 50%. When the number of tryptophan was half, the number of cells decreased from the previous half.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerating cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacterial cells develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, gene errors related to tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritated intestinal syndrome.
“We probably want to contribute to the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inside of the intestines,” Cervantes-Barragan says.
"The high level of tryptophane combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their spread."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United gets a deal with Nemanja Matic after his lines.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has won a deal with Nemanja Matic, who debuted at Manchester United in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
At the end of the last match, Matic started 2–1 in Dublin, United, ahead of the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday, as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best condition because he wasn’t involved in the blue seat tour of Asia before the start of the season, but only 45 minutes on the field, according to Mourinho, a change to be made before the start of the season.
“He takes time, but his experience, his intelligence, and his thoughts make him a neon – he has a natural football thinking ability,” Mourinho says.
"We'll help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started playing at the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho began to play their initial collection for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the company has already made a "spoke" by acquiring three of his four players to the top.
“Two out of four – you have to give them thanks,” he added.
"I'm more satisfied if I get all four, but they did a great job."
Air ballots attempted Germany for two weeks
The Finnish women's air ball team lost its fourth championship match to Germany directly at 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine level is high.
The balance of their game was in every sector, Finnish chief coach Tapio Kangasniemi told in the newspaper.
In the first two sections, Finland held its opponent's head, but in the third section, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads a block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to break together, Kangasniemi said.
The most powerful of Finland was 14 points collected by Pia Corhone.
Three of the four lost matches in Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Great ministry crew has already sent challenges to meeting Trump Jr in Russia
The U.S. team has challenged Donald Trump Jr and Russian historian Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The great team of specialty attorney Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the meeting of Russian journalist Natalia Veselnitskaja, known for contacting Donald Trump Jr and the Kremlin.
The news agency, Reuters, also confirms the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday’s announcement of an invitation to a big courtyard.
According to Reuters, the great team has challenged Trump Jr and the Kremlin Connecticut to the meeting of a well-known Veselnitska, which was held between the US presidential elections in June 2016.
At the time, Campaign Chief of Donald Trump Sr, Paul Manafort, and his rebellion, current advisor of the White House, Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called for a large court in Washington, means the intensification of the will of the Russian investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted to assist a large arbitration in order to investigate Russia’s interference with the US presidential elections and whether Trump’s campaign or its neighbouring cooperation with Russia in this matter.
A large ministry crew expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges, and forces people to testify.
There is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
A large cabinet will consider the evidence investigated by the prosecutor in the investigation and decide whether to raise the charges in the case.
The British inventor picked up herself to get home and car with a handheld.
The British inventor has been the first to microsize himself throughout the country so that he can open his home outside door, get to his office and start his car with a handheld.
The 33-year-old microsirus is between Steven Northam's headquarters and front fingers. Now he offers services to companies and individuals who want to make life easier with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam collaborates with a consulting sleeping doctor Geoff Watson at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to meet medical requirements.
Microsiruses are used in the same technology as cats and dog microsiruses, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also transforms the locks of houses and cars into compatible with a microcircuit. The processing of one locks costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and he has one child, who has installed microscirus technology both in his home and the BMW Z4 car, which starts when he drops his hands on the control wheel.
The White House exhibition paid thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the Southern White House for the event that introduced American production was to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is used as Marine One when the president is on its way. It was a petting corner at the White House event held on July 17, 2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials met products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter made in Connecticut, the samples included a ship from Mainest, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The White House’s military office had requested the helicopter to be on the site by a mission order only about 36 hours before it landed on the Southern Army Field for an "exceptional" event. This is evident from the HMX-1 helicopter ship documents.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his team on the day before the event, which is the deputy commander of the Marine Air Force.
The report reported that the helicopter would arrive at the south windfield at 17.7 p.m. in the morning and the event would start at three in the afternoon. The helicopter would leave the site only after the windfield was empty between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, the message noted that if the helicopter’s departure from the White House would be delayed, another crew would be required for service time limits.
The original crew was on the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were near the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The TIME magazine is not clear whether a second crew was finally required.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the HMX-1 documentation, the event violates the law.
"One of our questions was whether we had violated this Hatch Act. We were told that we were not guilty," the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate,” the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not part of the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political nuances.
At the event, the President spoke to the Senate on behalf of the health reform and of the state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is no new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions drew attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the president’s campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his previous president’s plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, where products made from American workers from all 50 states were presented," said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 crew regularly performs training flights in the Washington area and practices bringing the President to the White House with the accuracy of centimeters on the south.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings to the White House.
According to an official, flights to Made in America were part of a monthly crew training contingency.
Helicopters would also be on that day for 11 hours in "non-presidential supporting tasks".
According to the White House, there were no other costs for taxpayers from the event.
The reporter of Sikorsky said that the company did not participate in the launch of a helicopter on the south side of the White House.
The HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to the President's functions, and it is difficult to accurately assess the cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defense’s 2017 hour compensation, the VH-3D helicopter’s compensation rate is $24,380 per hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quanticon to the Virginia State to the White House took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating a helicopter is clearly lower.
"Computing costs for taxpayers according to compensation level is fraudulent," Walters says.
"The estimated compensation level includes the costs of staff, maintenance and many other so-called incurred costs taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the RAND research company’s 2015 survey, the rates of compensation do not include staff costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter.
“It is an idea to present American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud of being involved in ensuring national security and, probably, employing hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopters and other defence items for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is very important to point out.”
It’s not sure if Trump had been on the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat on the fire driver’s place.
In the White House, Trump laughed at the press about his own Sikorsky boat.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."

Venezuelan prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
The prosecutor of Venezuela has requested a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro said the last Sunday vote was scheduled to appoint a representative on Friday.
In a controversial vote on the country, a representative was chosen, inter alia, to amend the Constitution of the country.
According to Prosecutor Luisa Ortegan, the decision of prevention has been requested due to suspicion of elections.
Ortega has also initiated voting elections.
He appointed two judges after the British company, which held a representative vote, reported that the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was approximately a million more than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduron’s allies were provided, and the elected 545-member representatives include Maduron’s son and wife.
In addition to amending the Constitutional Act, the representatives can break down the opposition-led Congress and amend the laws.
Maduroa described as a dictator
Maduron’s actions are widely convicted.
The opposition considers the modification of the Constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, the UK, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, on their own, have announced that they do not recognize a new representative.
Maduro argues that the new representative is a solution to the political and economic crisis of the country.
In Venezuela, disturbances have continued for months.
There are many people injured, and more than one hundred people have died.
Venezuela has failed to drop the oil price in the economic crisis.
Many people don’t have any food or medication.
The opposition is expected to demonstrate its opinion on Friday, when a new representative is to start.
Finland's Russian extortion was sentenced to 4 years in jail in the United States
The Minneapolis Court in the United States on Thursday condemned 41-year-old Maksim Senaha for about four years of incarceration of participation in global computer trafficking.
Senah was arrested in Finland as a consequence of a request made by the United States in August 2015.
According to the Russian writer Fontana, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was home.
Finland sent Senah to U.S. law authorities in February 2016 despite Russian opposition, the news agency said.
He was found guilty of a computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars this year.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after a prison sentence.
Russia's foreign ministry spoke hard to Finland after arrest and said that a man should not be given to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were argued that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing it in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used Ebury’s computer virus that captured tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus captured usernames and passwords.
The hackers then used the information by continuing to control Internet traffic, which made clicks and spread the spam.
According to Kenneth Blancon, head of the Department of Justice of Crime, the case shows that the United States is able to trace other cybercriminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 20:58: Repair of the name of the convicted person.

Timo Soin's questionnaire titled article: "Then came water waste"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini published a blog post titled on the questionnaire on Thursday.
The writing is short, only two sentences measured.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of the thirty-sixth parliamentary.
Then there was a water cleaning, now all the clock, Soini writes.
The text contains references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludwig XV or this loving daughter, madame de Pompadouri, is known to use the waterproof comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the phrases in the books of history have remained in the phrases "we follow the waterfall" or "when I follow the waterfall".
According to the UN, Afghanistan’s democracy depends on the political role of women
The elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, are able to vote, said the UN Ambassador to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
U.N. Assistant Embassy’s temporary director Nicholas Haysom said that there are hundreds of women in the county council elections, three women strive to be vice president, and more than 30 percent of the recently registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be emphasized too much,” Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be truly representative and credible only if women participate in them fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The elections to the Afghan County Council and Presidency will take place on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has presented the threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving to an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time power moves peacefully from a democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said women’s contribution to strengthening Afghanistan’s democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Committee, 1.2 million women are from 3.6 million registered voters.

A flooding threat of certain tourists to the culture of the region
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The anger of locals is particularly aimed at representing the form of tourism in cross-border states.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: there is only a few hours and it is run through large numbers of attractions.
Venice is undergoing quick day trips to the city for tourists.
The streets have difficulty moving, and the fine openings are so full of visitors that the Venice residents are no longer able to join.
They are forced to move further from the historic center while the homes have become hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the present phenomenon poor-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large crossroads, the time is given for two or three hours.
You will follow the guide to Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and to St. Mark's Tower, and returning, Italian Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini, describes the overwhelming and problem-threatening tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the work of place, shops and workplaces.
We must keep this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Tower is also one of the most popular sites in Venice's historic centre.
On the top of the tower is the Church of St. Mark.
Local anger also focuses mainly on crossroads.
In the historic center of Venice, there are 50,000 more locals.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians were preferably opposed to mass massacres.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving people away.
Around 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, there will be no tourists in Venice in a few years.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe.
One is difficult, since ships bring Venice to its painfully needed income and create a need for workplaces in many different areas.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been formulated that the cruisers went farther from the historical center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative area of Venice, where Venice is located, should have more power to decide on its own matters - unless complete autonomy.
More than 20 to 30 million tourists visit each year in Venice.

Low-kilometer-measured ropes on the motorway
On the roadway between Kuopio and Lake Siilin, there have been miles of miles from work on Thursday afternoon at the time of return traffic.
The area is undertaken by motorways, which slows down traffic, says Savon Saomat.
For data, there is an hour speed limit of 50 km instead of an hour speed of 120 km.
However, in the 50-kilometer limit area, traffic had advanced on Thursday afternoon, in practice, the speed of walking.
Some of them went on Thursday afternoon on the side of the Lake Siil, on the Mount of Revelation, or on the golden cave.
I'm going to do well without such attention.
A 23-year-old driver has had to notice public curses.
Amalie Iuel has published great pictures of herself, among other things in Grand Canyon landscapes.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen to be a popular athlete in Norway in its current country, not least because in March he broke the recording of the 26-year-old Norway 400 meters in the course of the railroad at 51.81.
A month later, he improved 400 meters of assistance at the time of Norway's recording of 55.38.
Iuel, who used social media hardly after recording, noticed that fame and publicity had a shadow.
Men around the world began sending pictures of their genital organs to Iuel in the hope that a young racer would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close from outside of his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "blocks" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into a private, Iuel told the VG magazine.
Iuel did not want to identify exactly what pictures he had in the interview with VG.
You're sure you can guess, Iuel laughter.
It’s nice to get a feedback after running, but I’m going to do well without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, a Danish-Norwegian father.
The family of Iuel moved to Norway when Amali was two years old.
The 12-year-old family moved to Namibia for the sake of his father's work, then to Pakistan.
Afterwards, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a University of Southern California athlete in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains three coachs, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
There is much more open discussion in Norway than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches do not ask anything but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be personally engaged with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway's records at 400 metres and 400 metres of aid.
Footkamma led snow singer Janne Korve to the entire career of the skyline - now participating in the championships: "It's good if you don't tell anything"
It's been nice to calculate when you haven't happened anywhere!
Janne Korpi, a 31-year-old of Finland's most successful snowmaker, has actually enjoyed its beloved species this season.
Last summer, the career was still on the horizon.
The load of the footwear had forced Corve to the surgery table in January, and the foot did not want to be healed.
He also took his hand in the cat.
In the summer, I didn’t know what to do or not.
The sponsors were broken and a lot of things were open, Corpi says.
But that's what we're saying that things are normally organized.
My leg was healed, the sponsor continued the deal for two years, and the blood began to draw back to the breast.
The next decision was easy afterwards.
I knew it at the latest when I went to the snow.
I was that fucking, yeah, this is so fun again, let's get through a couple more.
The body was able to calculate properly only in September-October, but after a long breakdown, the only painless exercise has been a big thing.
The kittens have only a few rounds.
It doesn't matter.
The competition has never been the most important aspect of the board.
I've never lost a cat.
I think it's uncomfortable to star four years alone in the cats, and then you're hot for a week.
I can't think so, Corpi says.
The Corp will be held at the semi-pipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although the individual pockets don't like him on the board, he's always crashing in the hard part of the pocket.
According to the ear, the value of the kittens organized by the International Ski Union has increased over the past few years, although some of the Norwegian X-Games at the same time held on the list.
Yes, these are important categories, the visibility is great.
Nevertheless, I think that appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level in the cats.
The body is the oldest athlete in 12-speaking teams in Sierra Nevada.
The team's descriptions, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger.
It’s nice to follow the way the younger friends go.
I remember when I was at that stage that everything was new and so sick was excited about everything.
It also brings a new flow, the body thinks.
I'm still behind my chest, but otherwise I don't, there's a lot of power in my friends!
On the background of the boarding hours, Janne Korpi has also built another kind of sporting hours.
The son of Pekka Korve is engaged in a rabbit sport: the boarder has his own rabbit horses for which he performs training programs.
When I’m traveling all the time, I don’t want to be on the show anymore.
But I look at at least the dietary results every day and usually something from departure, the body tells.
Remediation and treatment preparations are a potential career plan according to the Corve when the boarding hours are completed at the time.
I'm not going to plan so far, but it's at least a likely option.
I experience it just like I'd study it in addition to this snow world.
I’m trying to stay nervous and evolve in the summer, maybe something is going to be going out.
If it’s my future profession, then it’s not difficult to start when it’s already ready inside the species.
The food items are also included in the Elitloppet-raviristeily organized with Jaajo Linnonmaa.
Duplex has rented a cruise valley that will be headed to the Elitloppet competition in Stockholm at the end of May.
The Corp and the Birds decided to revive the old tradition.
The crossing has gone very well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point that at least there will be no bankruptcy.
A few months still have time, hopefully we get the ship full, Corpi says with enthusiasm.
Attendon’s care project to Kite has surprised everything.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new, 41-seat-age care home to build for Kite.
The building of about 1,700 floor floor meters will be completed next summer on the other side of the neighbouring Health Center.
The topic of general surprise is what the new care unit is enough for customers, as during the Siun War, many private care homes are able to deal with customers.
Anne Flink Atendo, Director of Care Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, the freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Atendo bought private care houses last year from Kite, Kanervikkola and Erika.
The store was about business, but the real estate is known to be a five-year rental contract.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move functions away from these premises.
More about today later.
GMB is worried about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand in Scotland
The union requests a confirmation from McVitie's first manufacturer's leaders for long-term commitment to production at Glasgow's factory.
According to the Scottish department of the GMB General of the UK, the company has not reported its plans for the future of Tollcross factory.
The Hobnobs, Rich Tea and other products manufactured factory has more than 500 employees.
The McVitie's brand’s Pladis company said its investments in its factory in the last few years were over five million pounds.
The company added that employees and representatives of the trade unions will be "selected to be the first" if there are changes in their activities.
In a letter to the factory director, GMB calls for the company to "be careful that no funding has been demonstrated for modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy, the GMB professional association, is very concerned that the factory manager does not get clear information about Tollcross’ business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has strongly focused on the local community and Glasgow's big city area. The factory is a major employer in the region of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of emerging jobs, wages and execution, and from the point of view of Brexit, the continuing reduction in living costs and production, East Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production painfully."
According to the reporter of Pladis, the factory director had received a letter from the trade union only on the previous day and the company would respond directly to the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction with employees and representatives of the trade union.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB at Tollcross two months ago, discussing several issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, as with other highly competitive and uncertain companies on the market, we constantly evaluate all our business functions and place our offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
The company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross factory in recent years, particularly in its production lines and operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’ long history as a production facility, and we will certainly tell the first employees and representatives of the union if we are planning to make changes to the factory.”
Did PSG warn about the transfer from Barcelona to Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may be interested in Marco Verratil
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up for the goal of Neymar after paying the transfer amount of £189.99 for the end of the agreement, but did PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
Sensation-free transfer is the most spoken case of the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world transfer sum record. The previous record was less than half: it occurred when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of 89 million pounds.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive football player and also the world’s best hired professional athlete, as PSG offers him more than 500,000 pounds per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be angry with PSG’s activities and the way Neymar has left the most crowded companion. The source near Barcelona says that the companion has been very careful with Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did PSG's president warn the world of football about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned PSG's best players matches.
“I’m not worried, because they know that if they investigate our players, we will become their opponents and we will contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We are building all the sets.
But if they are investigating our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to be blamed for this: it would express its interest in PSG’s midfielder Marco Verrate earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may be good that Barcelona will lose its astronomer Neymar.

NYT: Trump’s calls were invented - White House spokesman: “I wouldn’t say it was a lie”
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump have never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump’s smoked calls with both the Mexican president and the leader of the party organization have proved to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that calls had not been made.
He said Trump didn’t lie.
According to Sanders, many party leaders talked to Trump personally, and Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieton had discussed at the G20 Hampshire meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a very hard blame.
These conversations took place, they did not only take place on the phone, but also on the faces, Sanders justified.
A speech to the Partians awakens anger
Trump told him on Monday that the Mexican President had called him and Trump in order to take away the successful illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that there would be a few more cross-Mexican borders because they know how to travel to the U.S. border.
The Mexican government issued a press release on Wednesday, saying that the conversation had not occurred.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump spoke at a large meeting of the National Party Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the party poetry, he said that it was the finest speech ever held for them.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the party organization said it would not be aware of any of its manager's calls to Trump.
According to Michael Surbaugh, an earlier statement in which he had asked Trump to apologize to the Partisans, he spoke to himself.
Trump’s speech at the party organization’s meeting raised a lot of surprise because it was an exceptional political thing in relation to the nature of the event.
It was the result of the presidential election last autumn.
