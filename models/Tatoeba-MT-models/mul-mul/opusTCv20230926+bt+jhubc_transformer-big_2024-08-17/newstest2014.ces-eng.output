A black cabinet in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money for repairs that break down the road network, many begin to see solutions in a small black cabinet that easily enters your car’s device board.
The equipment that monitors every kilometre that the driver unites and transmits this information to the authorities is the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and the State Planning Authority to renew the old U.S. main road financing system.
Usually, phased road design at a sudden has stimulated intense debate and the creation of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of ecologists and lobbyed to allow the government to use these small cabinets that would record captured kilometres and perhaps even where you are going – and then use this information to make a tax measure.
The tea party is scared.
The U.S. Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states do not expect anything.
They find out how they can move to the system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road on which he goes.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black cabinets, some of which have GPS tracking.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of where we can choose,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who plans to start tracking the captured kilometres for every California motorist in 2025.
It will change the way we pay these taxes.
It uses this technology to do so.
The fact is that the Road Trust Fund funded from taxes that the Americans pay for pump stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as before.
Cars hit a lot more kilometres for a gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians tend to raise taxes for only one cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
His state recently placed tracking devices up to 500 cars to test this payment system for a detained kilometre.
“In the long run, it appears to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometers captured.
It is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, for example, which can help reduce traffic traps and generate greenhouse gases.
California designers look at this system in planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee, said he also considers it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation’s representatives of the free market are also excited to think that drivers will pay for a detained kilometers.
“It’s not a tax that’s going to disappear in the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for the Strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they receive.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who invited Congress in 2011 to go to the direction of pay per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which should include about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and thus made it because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the components of the population, whose daily lives often mean to strike many kilometres for work outside the city.
However, a number of countries and cities are moving forward on their own.
The worst is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon begin to pay the state tax for the detained kilometres instead of the tax for gasoline.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently examining the project.
Illinois is trying to do so to a limited extent in trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministry of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how this change can be implemented.
This concept, however, has not only a supporter.
In Nevada, where the equipment had recently been equipped with about 50 volunteers, drivers were worried that the government was able to monitor each of their movements.
"The activities related to Big Brother's monitoring and similar issues were a major problem," Alauddin Khan, who manages strategy and operations at the Nevadian Ministry of Transport, said.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project continued, the U.S. Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into a full-value tracking device.”
There is no need to build a huge heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably extend to the record of individuals’ daily exit and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the countries that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers of the truck can be found, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be quiet.
Hon has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (the real catching distance).
This company was originally not involved in the government’s aid in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to prophesy on the emerging market for legal responsibility insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they pay.
But this device that is testing attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and provides only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go on if you don’t follow their speed and position,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have occurred in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less affordable ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with choosing drivers.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a pause fee based on the average number of kilometers of all residents of the State.
In other places, they hope that the attention of the public will come to this concept if the device will know more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop tax facilities that would be equipped to additionally allow parking hours to pay charges, to provide insurance by kilometers captured and to collect data on the speeds of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid traffic stops.
“Motorists will be willing to participate in this due to the value of the benefits they offer,” the city project document says.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all discussions about payments per kilometre are not just a huge representation problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Committee in the San Francisco Coast say the Congress could easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by increasing gasoline taxes.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so a fair share will be paid.
"There is no need for radical operations when richly enough to take aspirin," Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee for Legislation and Public Affairs, said.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
The Czech Republic negotiates on Saturday.
Social democracy, people and grandmothers, are talking together and are working together.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will meet the negotiations table with perfectly played partners who will put a list of requirements on the table, including ministerial posts.
The Czechoslovakia Ambassadors will either join the acid coalition grapes, or beat the rugged minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka after four days, when he was in the wave of sympathy, hit for the first time.
Yesterday he was unable to control the political grumium and, above all, forced the punished liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is the only one, the rest of the team members will be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee.
I apologize to the members of the Gremium and now also to the citizens.
There is no lies in your personal life or in the public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after negotiating the closest leadership of social democracy.
He added that he was not the first Vice-President.
"I will make my decisions on 10 November to the UVV," said Hashek.
In the same way, the vice president of the Czech Republic, Zdenīk Škromach, and the head of the parliamentary club, Jeronim Tejc, spoke.
He said he was elected only two days ago.
Both Members said they would do their best to make the 50-member club of the Czech Republic sound with a single voice.
The absurd theatre, Michal Hašek, said: "I am a member of the Czech Republic for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its mark and have respected the decisions of the parties."
Another lie in direct transmission.
Or has he forgotten, at the call for Sobotko’s resignation and withdrawal from the negotiation team, that the August UVV made 57 percent of the fact that Bohuslav Sobotka is a party candidate for the Prime Minister?
However, by calling the UVV to the next Sunday, the Chief of the Czech Republic produced a powerful hostile army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to float the emails of 192 members of this body as well as the media in the dreams of various trees and trees, possibly reminding Sobot's real political career errors.
It will be very dirty to wash, signs of the dark alliance between the carbon baron Zhenk Bakalá and the Sobotk wing will appear.
The friendly relationship of Bohuslava Sobotky and the influential lawyer Radka Pokorný will be discussed.
There are disputes in the South Moravia or Moravskoskoslez organization of the Czechoslovakia.
The words of the Ostrava Prime Minister and Sobot’s allies, Peter Kajnar, are warned: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country will not be ruled by idiots.”
If UVV had been meeting this weekend, liars would probably be forced to sacrifice ritually their functions.
The traitors will take their heads off and stay.
The winning boss of the Czechoslovakia will then end with the overname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russia is demanding
His mouth’s corners will indicate a dirty smile and then only deeply breathe: “It’s challenging.”
Cooperation with the 2014 Sochi Olympic organization team is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
What was in the previous Olympics can be forgotten.
“Nothing works the same way,” said the Czech Olympics.
What's going on in particular?
Many things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of facts, they are relatively faster, from the point of view of providing information about essential things not so much.
Maybe for three months, we’ve been looking for them to add how the individual villages will be officially labeled so that we can do a lot of things.
We're still waiting and they're still saying that they're talking about it.
In a number of things, they are still communicating.
Are the Olympics already available?
But this is no longer a catastrophic state.
A month ago we went through empty rooms.
Fortunately, homes are worth.
What does it mean that they are empty?
Do you need finished floors?
It was just a basic concrete, so this was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there is a risk that we will be there until January 26 as a pre-release, there will still be a limestone.
And if they weren't chasing, what would it be?
You think President Putin was going to strike the army?
That's what I guess will happen.
Just so that it is not that the Olympic Village = the Darkkin Village.
It is more likely that they will not, for example, be able to adjust the road, do not give details.
Maybe they'll have a trip in such a state that we'll have to take with us holines from London games.
But I think it's somehow going to go to the bath.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
They are now about 78, although the number changes depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the crushers will probably get out of the three of them.
No one has to doubt about the speedwriter Martin Sablikka, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still waiting for a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26.
How the houses will look in the Olympic village, we know.
We even measured some things by metro so that we couldn’t believe only in plans.
We also prepare a number of other things, including transportation.
What does the mission boss do for a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for an annual assessment of the individual Olympic sports plus I make a regular agenda in the sense of communication with the organizational committee in Sochi.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, a plan of shattering him big secret treasures
The fans of winter sports are already cutting the metre to start the Olympics in Sochi, others are increasingly concerned about their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, which starts until February, will face another scandal.
The Russians will not be able to fulfil the promise that the preparation and play of games will not be disrupted in the least nature of Krasnodar land when Caucasus falls, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will meet in four months.
Finally, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high landing, Canada’s Olympics were registered as the most environmentally friendly in history.
However, it appears that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to organize games with “zero waste” has long taken for his own.
Reporters of the AP agency discovered last week a huge treasure of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Then, ecologists found the sheet full of construction materials, tyres, canisters and insulation pins already in August, which were immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have disappeared and the shield has disappeared.
But just for a moment.
Last week, reporters showed a view of the trees of the size of three football clubs.
Not the only one in the field of such places has emerged, the British newspaper The Times wrote.
The Russian Railway, a state monopoly, is working on the site, which builds a 60km road between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The company, which has already collected 280 billion rubles, led one of Putin's close collaborators, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railroad was prevented from establishing the treasury by some of the sub-contractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Ashtar, all around them have been driving trucks full of waste materials for three months and nights.
According to experts, waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu River, other rivers and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates partial water sources over the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimajev to the British newspaper of the EWNC's ecological non-profit organization.
Illegal treasures are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: Sochi games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing will cost 43 billion.
London's games cost only 19 billion and the above-mentioned nine billion vancouver.
In addition to corruption scandals, project retention and concerns, if there will be snow in the end, reports have also been reported that human rights are not respected when working at the exhibition of sports and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sent his mouth to protest that he was not paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers meet with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during the game.
Some visitors are willing to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple mature to stay with parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese Tai and Associates studio received a project to design a house on a parcel that lies at the corner of two streets, while the soil itself is slightly stirred up.
The demand also cost two generations to live together in the house, but each should have its own clear-separate space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly stirring ground.
The architects decided to place each house in one of the fathers of the house.
"In the creation of the proposal, we respected family associations, history and memories related to the site."
"Three different functions of the house are connected through the outside of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but at the same time have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The home of parents is at the level of a garden with an old borovic, to which family traditions and memories are appreciated.
Individual parts of the house are easily recognized already outside, because the different final adjustment of the facade differs.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was made by the help of the panels of the bucket, the part where the office is, is depleted in white and the remaining elements remained in pure concrete execution without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely shiny, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected to the exterior.
The home of parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance for the family.
The interieur’s connection with the exterior highlights the side wall, which begins on the garden and continues to the living room.
The kitchen in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house with the main entrance to the hall and then goes up stairs into their spaces.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their design allows them to penetrate a lot of natural light through them.
That’s why the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and print something unique to him.
The home of a young couple is reconciled as one open space with kitchen, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace it is divided only by a glass wall with moving doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes the terrace, from which there is a beautiful view of the Tokyo Gulf.
The office itself on the highest floor is the capture in a pure combination of white and black colors.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house with the main entrance, appears in the entrance hall and then goes up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters to students, pedagogy and high school leadership in several countries to defend academic freedom from the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman at school.
I met with more or less success.
The director of the Masarykov University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the Honorary President of the SPOZ - Zemanovci during the election period, was even received by the director in the form of no invitation to celebrate the Czech Republic’s State Celebration.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were not so bold and allowed to visit Milo Zemana: Higher Technical Learning in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyně University in Ústi nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubicas with continuing to promote policy at high schools.
Simeon Karamazov, a newly elected member of the ODS, a dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, refuses to resign from his academic function and, in addition, it seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, this is not really the same as if you were, for example, the mayor of the smaller city.
Do you want to be a member of the SSSD hectares who simultaneously perform the role of the Member and hectares and as well as they degrade both professions?
This means that people can handle both of these challenging functions on the left side.
I know, here we have an example of Michael Haška, who can handle even several dozens of functions at once.
But this is probably not just an example of the person you should manage.
We will also find a opposite and positive example of MUDr. Stefana Frankovka, who preferred to leave the post of Parliament to be fully devoted to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the function of the Deka is that during the co-function you violate the apolitics of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The leadership of the Pardubian ODS sees your current action on both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help the school without staying a deceased.
I think the same opinion as I and the rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students as well.
So consider your remission and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may be that voters will count on you in the next elections.
And it must not have a long duration.
In Kunovikas the bible of greens, chemistry does not add to it
More than a thousand tonnes of grapefruit want to produce in the Slovak Frute Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé in the coming months.
The season started here in October and lasts about six months.
Healthy flowers here have been manufactured in a traditional way since 1925, i.e. by spraying directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarety.
Our workplaces have been found for an exchange of almost ten kilometers of route.
In each of the ten tanks there are fifteen to thirty tons of herbs, filling one takes three exchanges,” said Fruta Klavroba, director of the Slovak race.
The farmers from Ostrožska and Brzeclavska drive to the company’s area directly from their fields.
Fruty employees then clean the vegetables, remove the bottles and throw them into the stove.
From there, already decorated herbs fall into the pools with a six-inch depth, in which untiredly work sneakers dressed in white clothes and hollows.
This excites unwanted air.
The last collapsed layer of herbs is covered with sheet and loaded with water.
"The green crusher then hurts for six to eight weeks after spontaneous milk swelling without any additive of swelling supportive substances," said Cladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, the individual layers of workers wear salt and mining.
The green after the excavation moves to the filling lines.
It is packed in a sweetened fold into bottles or glasses and undergoes sterilization.
Hamé delivers beans, especially on the domestic and Slovak market.
Interest is recorded in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany in connection with U.S. monitoring
Edward Snowden, a US reporter, said he was willing to go to Berlin to provide evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to answer questions about their activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and talked with him about the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who transmitted the media on Friday in Berlin, said: “Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, the government continues to behave as a move and seeks to criminalize political manifestations by heavy prosecutors that do not provide space for defense.”
To speak the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believes that the support of the international community could convince the US government to remove the charges against him.
The charges made by the Ministry of Justice of the United States include spying and stealing state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to allow it.”
The tensions in the relationship between the United States and Germany began to rise when the allegations emerged that the NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, a parliamentary panel overseer of the report, said that if there was any opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness “without exposing danger and destroying relationships with the United States,” it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a parliamentary member of the German Greens party, has published a photo with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his way to Russia.
Mr. Sträbele said that, according to former NSA contractual lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he once left.
If Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he would need to make sure that he would be “safe,” he said.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said he had faced strict and persistent campaigns associated with persecution, which forced him to leave home.
He said, however, that the reaction of the whole world to his "act of political expression" gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and high officials, including those in the United States, have evaluated the discovery of an unreasonable system of all-precedented monitoring for public service.
The letter includes the proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, "until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved."
They're killing us, but we're innocent, the representatives of the Red Khmer
Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of the Red Khmers and Khieu Samphan was the former head of state.
Under the rule of the Red Khmers, which in the period 1975-1979 rejected a mixture of Maoism and Nationalism, more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of their population, died as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture, and murder.
In 2010, the S-21 International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia gave the commanders a life sentence to imprisonment.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, torture and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were surprised by believing that they act in the best interests of the nation and didn’t know what the real scope of murder is.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything, and therefore intervene and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan said in a court statement on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
“The fact is that I had no power,” he added.
Nuon Chea noted that he never ordered the Red Khmers to "behave badly with people or kill them to reject food or commit genocide."
He admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all Cambodian people," he said.
Bin Sivla, a fifty-year-old, who came to the Red Khmer regime for eleven relatives, said the AFP could not accept Nuon Chea's apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be freed of guilt."
"It's not about the other," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordination wouldn't kill," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmers are "worse than monsters."
In the court, Ieng Sary, who died in March, was also the "ministry of foreign affairs" of the Red Khmer regime.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, who was then minister of social affairs, found in September 2012 an incapable trial for dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmers Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines will pay hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for the deposit of manual luggage on board during its flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to impose a charge of up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or sofa, although they said in their Wednesday announcement that passengers will be able to keep their entire bag.
The new charge for the handheld luggage applies to luggage in the upper storage space, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 if passengers with payment are waiting for the arrival of the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that a stoolar fee has to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We wouldn’t like to take that charge,” she said.
The airlines started paying the first and second baggage provided in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and climbed into the handbags hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one of the way travelers learn to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the meaning of this new fee isn't really getting more money.
It is the fact that Frontier’s most loyal customers have clearly expressed that finding a place in the upper storage space is increasingly difficult.
Travellers who purchase tickets on the website of the company will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front at Frontier’s gate can bring a luggage for which nothing will pay, while the other passenger in front will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the websites and cancellation procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers are informed of the fees before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new charge for the handheld luggage will not go into effect before the summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
Travellers often complain about luggage fees and other fees, but the airlines love them.
He claims that the handling of the luggage is worth money, and passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many at Wall Street see additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after loss flights.
However, most of them did not pay for hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines was the first to pay hand baggage three years ago and another low-cost Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the charge for Spirit’s manual luggage would bring $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines leader, recently flew with Spirit and was surprised at what he saw at the gate when passengers met with the unusual Spirit charge for a hand baggage.
“It was the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my airline career,” he said.
I waited to see teeth and disputes at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the invasion took place in the ball."
Frontier will also apply charges for coffee, tea, soda and juice according to Spirit’s pattern.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemon or juice can leave the whole pot and coffee will be supplemented for free.
The water will continue to be delivered free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways had shortly tried to impose drinking fees, but after complaints from passengers, it resigned seven months later, and no other significant airline did compare it.
Frontier’s last cost to pay the handbagage if the passenger does not buy flights directly from this airline is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than to do so via online travel agencies.
Frontier, however, has been far away from this area.
In September, she began to give customers who purchased through an internet travel agency only half a mile within the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for a mile to 25 per cent of the road.
So the journey with Frontier is 1000 miles long purchased via an online travel agency, which means a reward of 250 miles.
Customers also allow the company to choose their headquarters in advance only if they purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown in Denver, but its business begins to crash and lose money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by Republic Airways Holdings, markets fell by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter.
Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
NSA’s website fails to accuse hackers, but “the internal error”
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its websites fell for a few hours last week due to internal errors, not due to hacker attacks, as some claimed on the internet.
“NSA.gov pages were not available for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates,” the spy agency said in a statement.
The problem will be solved during this evening.
The allegation that the accident was caused by a DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA websites were not working at least six hours, and the pages are still not accessible to some users.
Previously, NSA spokesperson ABC News reported that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” threatened.
Speaker said no secret information was threatened.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed it was responsible for removing the NSA site through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to float the target website with information until the servers become difficult and the page falls down.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the sense of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA supersecret agency, who once received a surname No such agency, has been in the past months after snowing the discovery of foreign and domestic monitoring programs, focusing on public attention, and blaming criticisms, a jointly criticizing the product of the secrecy of NSA files by Edward's secrecy of the agency's defeat and the defeat of their defeat.
This growing controversy around the agency has stimulated earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of targeted cyber-operation.
Bombardier’s profit declined due to a decrease in supply and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced on Thursday a decline of 15 per cent in net profit due to less number of orders and delivery in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, headquartered in Montreal, has also not published any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has provided up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to launch commercial operations since September.
After the start of the test flight about a month and a half, the aircraft only flew three times, so the question arose whether the test phase is going well.
The results did not complete the estimates and the stock stocks in Toronto declined by 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced on Thursday the rating from “high profitability” to “exploring the sector” with the expectation that the bursa will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While smaller aircraft supplies were mostly expected, the profit margins in the transport sector were significantly disappointed,” Doerksen said in a report.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new CSeries aircraft orders.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we assume that the market skeptics will rise against this programme.
Bombardier hopes that airplanes of the CSeries will run into the lower market area now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March and the first flight took place after several months of delay in September.
However, the number of mandatory CSeries aircraft orders reaches the modest 177 as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims on low consumption and savings on the cost of this transportation aircraft.
Currently, a total of 403 orders and obligations are made by 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, Executive Director, expected Bombardier to achieve 300 binding orders when introducing the first aircraft into commercial use.
Leaders also assured analysts and media that the program is following the plan.
“The experimental plane has not remained on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the tests on the ground and software updates were planned during the suspension of the plane.
Each manufacturer plans it differently.
We decided to finish the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did that.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second in five test planes should fly in the coming weeks and the other soon afterwards.
Analysts are skeptical against the fact that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan for aircraft to be operated and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – although it is in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – will probably strengthen our view that the launch will be launched for the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million, 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit was lost to $147 million, 8 cents per share in the third quarter of the previous year.
The adjusted revenue per share remained unchanged to 9 cents.
The marginal turnover fell from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to IBES, Thomson Reuters analysts expected revenue of 10 cents per share and turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had only supplied 45 aircraft over the quarter, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the Aviation Division amounted to 32.9 billion on September 30, which will not change until 31 December.
“The results in aviation were in line with our views, but low order revenue and overall market status disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
The aviation industry’s revenue fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train maker, said revenue in this division increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 30 September to 32.6 billion, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margins in the transport division were affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The officials said that new views will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced Google’s financial director Patrick Pichette’s arrival, fell by 8.5% during the trade on Thursday afternoon to $4.83.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, announced a decline in a quarterly profit of 10 per cent on Thursday.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the mafia from police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) had to provide information to the King of the Underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would appear.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years of jail.
The top defender, who informed the drug mafia of a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would appear, was sentenced to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had, after becoming a suspect of taking cocaine, transmitted sensitive information to Neil Scarbrough's sub-world head on investigating his drug use activities.
The lawyer whose surname was "Bash" (parties) and who was criminally celebrated as the best lawyer, was arrested at home in 2011 after Scarborough's police surveillance, which he had been in previous drug-related proceedings.
The police saw Sarborough (32 years), leaving three bags of cocaine at the Blackburn lawyers house in Lancashire, which was just dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his money ladders and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to get information about the arrest of two men in the interests of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were observed during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police detained heroin and cocaine at an estimated £1.5 million, along with £200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended in prison with them.
Ditta (42) provided information to criminals for fear that it would come to be dependent on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors legal company headquarters in Blackburn, has experienced before the Liverpool Crown Court a moment of embarrassment when after a three-week trial he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases.
During the previous hearing, he admitted to holding cocaine.
The lawyers of the falls came after Scarborough's police investigation found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two suspects were watched, recorded his arrival to Ditt's house, and saw him put drugs in purity of 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Later, Scarborough and Ditta were at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone interview.
The lawyer went home where he found drugs, and nine conversations between the two people took place.
The court said there were traces of drugs of class A in his hair, money and on his credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
The ditta was later arrested, but the use of cocaine denied, and said he spoke with the suspect because he was his client, and argued that their conversation belonged to "confidencial communication".
During his arrest, Ditt took his wallet and tried to get out of it several credit cards, but all were detained and the hair samples were taken from him.
At the police interview, he said he was operating the office at both his home address and at the workplace, and that he was also visited by customers because of the job matter.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted significant players in the drug supply chain, some of whom had previously represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: “One else is more aware that he should not violate the law than a criminal prosecutor.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer and of being in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyers-client relationship.
Police investigated as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not have a good reputation for his profession, but was deprived of her.
He was too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
"If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I would like to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
But after hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead from Lancashire said, “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal himself from the lawyer in the criminal area at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine was unhopefully weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of senior representatives of organized crime groups, who gave him the task of collecting valuable information about police investigations.
Legal representatives must respect the highest principles of inequality and must stimulate the public’s confidence and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the trap of his profession.
The unit for serious and organized crimes in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditt, under which he was also condemned for three cases of detention of cocaine and now for preventing justice, demonstrating our obligation to bring a criminal to court.
This case should serve all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of jail after being convicted of confession for the delivery of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five persons involved in trade were arrested for 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta organized an online interview, in which he said his work would be legally representing American Death Tax Customs Customers as a dinner guest, Mohammed Ali, and as a motive for work, inequality.
He talked about the government with Klaus and Spidley.
Now the people of John Kasala sent against Grandma.
People have won 14 members in the elections, namely only one-third of the number of social democrats or representatives of the ANO.
The government negotiates with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun investigating possible coalition barriers, Jana Kasala - a man who has imposed the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats, neither Andrei Babiš, have such a matador on their own side.
This is probably the first negotiation in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was at the time minimal," Kasal estimates how the conversations will evolve this year.
Kenya Press Refugees Controversial Media Act
“It’s a terrifying report and it’s on the spot to ask what will prevent Parliament from avoiding the independence of justice tomorrow,” the newspaper said.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most renowned independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribune would “always be predetermined because it is prolonged by the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will hear us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to Star newspaper, the draft law actually transmits to the government "fully control of the media" and the newspaper Standard states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "haved a harsh wound" and criticizes the draft law as "precious".
The adoption of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the October attack of an Islamic shooter in the Westgate Shopping Center.
The anger of the Kenya authorities turned on the media when they sent a security camera record, where soldiers who were sent to the site of the attack were allegedly exploiting luxury goods trade.
The police director responded by leaving two journalists and the head of the media staff to be interviewed, but the press release was downloaded later.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists can be fined by up to one million, along with the risk of "excluding the list" or can be rejected by official journalist accreditation.
The court also has the right to occupy the property of the offender unless the penalty is paid.
According to Daily Nation, “there is one penalty enough to eradicate most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation impact on what is called Kenya’s “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that when the media quiet, they can do whatever they want.
“You never know what can happen,” the newspaper Nation Mutuma Mathiu wrote, describing Kenya media as the key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“When we leave this in politics, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and bring us back to hunt and collection,” he wrote.
In the past, lawmakers in Kenya were critical of the public.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of the cards governed by the National Salary Agency and for the restoration of their fat wages of about 532,000 uninformed shillings per month, which are the highest in the world.
They have to marry, the young Czechs know.
Most of them don’t even know with any interest.
More and more Czechs give money to themselves.
However, they don’t get to the championships in the region.
The most money on the side is deposited by Rakušani, who saves an average of EUR 181 a month.
Something more than the Czech people in Slovakia.
This results from the Erste Savings Barometer survey in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the turmoilers is improving, and two-thirds of those asked are planning to spend more money on the side.
While Czechs are approximately in the middle of a number of screws, in Romania and Serbia people saving products are still using very few.
For example, nearly every other Serbian, according to a survey, will stay at home "under a gunfire".
In the country this year, the number of people who spend more monthly amounts has increased.
Even last month, the number of savings was estimated to be approximately 25,000 to 25,000,6% of respondents, and this year it was 5 percent more.
The average monthly storage in the interyear comparison but slightly decreased to 2078 krone.
The biggest hit among the savings products is the retirement connection.
This prefers 54% of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36% of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of construction savings declined, compared to last year, interest in investment funds was also significantly lost.
Only 16 percent of respondents are already used, while nearly one-fourth of them were last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what revenue they achieve for each product.
In particular, young people under the age of 30 don’t know how their money is paid.
On the contrary, the best consciousness of the profitability of its deposited money has the oldest group of questioned people, 73% of the questioned people over the age of fifty know it.
In the international comparison of the Erste Czech group, 44% of the people regularly use online banking.
These are Slovaks and Rakušani with a 12 percent decline.
The United Nations celebrates new goals to combat poverty
The United Nations begins immediately working on a new set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that have been introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Before the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, which began at night in Riu de Janeir, Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of “sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDG, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
The UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said at the night at the summit that it is now time to “confess over national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and adopt a process to introduce the general objectives of sustainable development – the SDG,” he said.
The SDG will build on progress achieved within the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development programme after 2015.
I am striving to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States and to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDG.
Security concerns for Mozambique are increasing due to a conflict of strong personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputa under the shoe of Samora Machely, the founder of Mozambique president, to provoke peace passwords for rare public demonstrations.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, Executive Director of Investment Company.
From fear of the future of her country, she exchanged business clothing for a shirt decorated with the inscription “required security” in Portuguese and joined her on Thursday to the Square of Independence in the capital.
Two weeks later, reports on conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst defeats from the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an unfamiliarly known rebel movement, originally supported by the White government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will emerge again in the country, but the recent events will lead to foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake because the discoveries of extensive coastal oil reserves and coal tanks in the northwest in the next few years can bring more than $50 billion investments from companies such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko.
The Governing Party of Frelimo, a dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo are accusing each other of tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has raised the last conflicts by launching a attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo Party.
The violent attacks of former rebels were subsequently overwhelmed when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afons Dhlakamu, the group's leader, said Renamo Fernando Mazanga, spokesman of the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of launching conflicts because he said he was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to relieve concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office of the AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "destroyed" who wanted to use "whatever his strength remains to try to prove that he could order the government his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim that they want to avoid wars.
The concerns, however, rose when Mr. Mazangy said that the Renamo party deviates from the 1992 peace agreement.
FT said that it was not the case that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously," Mr. Mazanga said.
The previous talks between these parties have made to mitigate tensions between these parties, which have scattered a number of cracks this year, only few.
It is a sharp between two major characters (Guebuza and Dhlakama), a professor at the Open University and a Mozambique specialist Joseph Hanlon said.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator, nor is one of them ready to make the necessary proceeds.
The Renamo party, who wanted to change the election, has already expressed its commitment to boycott municipal elections planned for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort to gain benefits and financial gains from the government.
Since 1992, the Renamo Party’s election share has been reduced, while the newer Party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former Renamo Party member, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says Mr. Guebuza – which will end the second functioning period next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
"The democratic system doesn't want more parties, it doesn't want transparent elections, it doesn't want peace because it doesn't want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what the Renamo party has, but he has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the main road between the north and the south.
Most of the floods occurred in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers away from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira is the port on which they rely, including Rio Tinto and Vale, when exporting carbon.
In June, Rio stopped the use of railroads for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to express himself asking if Renamo is repeating his threat.
Renamo wanted to “refuse the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased government frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, slow pace of development and recent floods.
"People think that responsibility for the future of the country is solely the government and the president and that he must be the one who finds a solution to problems," he said.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, want free access to the road,” he said.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for lifestyle,” says the author.
The stories of Thor can show that “the ruthless power cannot be equal to the intelligent illusion,” while Artus legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large portion of myths would “be too wild for teaching at school, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene,” Crossley-Holland, who signed for a careful selection of works according to the age.
“I think it’s great that myths and human creation are already part of education,” he said.
I've had this plan for 20 years.
He added that "Openly Teaching" authors and teachers are in a highlighted story with a "subway" message for children as a "switching".
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Beowulf epoch from English and also writes the Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and the British national poetry, says: “You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them for yourself.”
The biggest difference between adult writers for adults and adult writers for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended with happyendem, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly determined.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Brno Star Wars brings visitors into space in a new digital
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the large planetary has changed in the last six months.
There is a new venue, visitors can get into new comfortable seats, and over their heads the projection area of 17 meters in the form of a cow from the American Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order to make the image perfect, further smaller projectors are set after the hall.
Another important part of the entire device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate the image," Brno star director Jiří Dušek said.
Computers will ensure that the image of several projectors does not cover itself, but gives a full impression.
"The computer's wheel is thirty-four times higher than in classical personal computers," the technician from the star star Tomáš Hladík said.
The digital unit can explore the extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The viewers are so climbing in the middle of the universe or human brain.
Other similar facilities are closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The leader of the stars plans to carry out purchased orders in the hall and its own creation.
From Saturday, there are two series on the program.
The first is named Astronaut and is designed for adults.
In it, people will learn about the training of astronauts, fly into the universe, rely on centrifuge, and then on observational examples, how the demanding conditions of astronauts in the space are facing.
The second row is for children and has the name Kaluoka'hina.
He tells the story of a rash whose pestro-colored residents lived in a quiet life until the moment of the explosion of a nearby soup.
The entire digital sector cost about fifty million krone, which was mostly paid by the Ministry of Education.
With less amounts, Brno and the starry city also contributed from its budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, a projector of twelve million.
"The rest of the audiovisual techniques and computers were assembled," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digital was followed after the renovation of the entire building that the star star passed two years ago.
According to Dusk, 25 to 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
We graduated from 11 000 Inserts!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 advertisers offering jobs, of which 4,300 were published in daily press and 6,800 advertisers (62 percent) on the internet.
The Internet becomes the most important media for publishing employment offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it was about 60 percent.
Advertising employment opportunities in itself, according to analysis, significantly reflects the current situation in the labour market.
An example can be the simple comparison of the number of advertisers published during the period of economic prosperity and during the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, nearly 25,900 advertisers were published in the same period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is focused on a narrower, particularly a more qualified group of professions.
On the contrary, the daily press employment offer covers a broader spectrum of professions including those of workers, the analyst Paulin Štěastn said.
The rate of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the heads of ads are ranked by managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The positions of programmers or leaders of small businesses figured only on the internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation belongs especially to the service and workers professions.
The most commonly stated requirements that employers express through an advertisement offer include, of course, education.
Another observed area included knowledge of foreign languages, particularly English.
In the daily press, a demand for foreign language knowledge was set in three percent of advertisers, 37 percent on the internet.
Only in two percent of the advertisers employers requested active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The claims for "computer grammar" appeared in 40 percent of advertisers (in daily printing 11 percent, on the Internet 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54% of advertisers.
Practice requirements are associated with qualified professionals.
This is particularly about producing leaders and other managers.
The work professionals are particularly related to mechanics and repairers or to manufacturers and processors of foodstuffs or to repair electrical equipment, the author of the study, Jiří Tillner.
Employees also lay down requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential applicants in half of their advertisers.
As the most frequently required skills, communication skills have been discovered in the first place of advertising for a long time.
In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The 10th anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that New York was the place where a solo comedy show was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the varied artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Broadway Theatre Palace, began to tell the crowded people with the method of interview.
Fayo’s innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
The festival, founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too large to play in the club,” Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes the performances of Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes” and an annual musical favourite performance at Madison Square Garden, which include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As the festival expanded, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comedians who attended the festival this year came from non-traditional channels such as show in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll excited himself with his sitcom (beautiful "League" on the fantastic football theme at FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slateova was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation", but she celebrated the fastest spreading video series "Marcel the shell with shoes on" (Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clear-recognized voices (surreately pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, jealous, racial-focused W. Kamau Bell), are a product of the decentralized American comedy world.
One of the biggest events of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedy but became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he held the TV Land show "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the street between the two buildings and says, "Man, if I get all the money, I'll probably live here."
The price of oil dropped to $96 per bar
Oil prices on Friday continued to decline as concerns over high stocks exported by a report showing the strengthening of the Chinese industry's energy-based landing sector.
The U.S. oil supply indicator in December late morning fell in European e-commerce at the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per bar.
On Thursday, the decline of 39 cents was 5.8 per cent for the month of October.
The rich oil warehouses in the past few weeks have charged the price.
On Wednesday, the Ministry of Energy said the U.S. stocks increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, the stock has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, from two reports on Chinese production, the incentive came to a greater demand that showed growth in activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery, which has grown to 7.8% in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades, could continue to grow.
Oil Brent, an international oil indicator used by American refinery, fell at the London International Trade Exchange by 26 cents to $1108.58 per bar.
That's not, Mr. Hasch.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians not that.
It is necessary to develop such a pressure so that Martin Hašek is freed from all political functions and leaves his mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so miserable.
Martin Hashek is protecting himself by the promise he has given, but every politician and politician must be aware of the consequences of that promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Confidence is the only capital that politicians have (Mr. Babiš also has the material, but it is the question that politicians have said).
The best program promoted by a liar is unreliable.
In politics, it is unclear, in politics, it is unclear.
Mr. Hasch, if you think so well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in that, so if you didn't just -- here you see how it's complicated with lying), you'll leave politics alone, as a guy.
People will accept your apology as an expression of a man who has committed a mistake and bears its responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as irreversible weaknesses, whose words or actions cannot be believed.
Whether you want to be proud, be a missing person or a lifestyle scheme.
It may seem to you that it is unjust when I speak only to you, but you are a leader and they are only a helpless sheep.
And you're a leader and you've always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to shut up your ears for a moment, rebuild the powers, sit down here, and then attack again, but that's how they behave partisans or subtraction.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes, a leader, alpha male, so be so.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court blocked regulations on the process of arresting and investigating persons from the police department in NY
The Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday blocked the judicial regulation demanding changes in the programme of arrest and investigation of persons at the New York Police Department and appealed to the judge of the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeal said Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision would be delayed until the decision of the city's appeal.
In August, the court decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of arrest and interrogation of people.
The city of its conclusions and its legal regulations were adopted, including the decision to award supervision which would help the police department change its practices and their training programme associated with them.
The appeal court heard the arguments for the requested delay on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be appealed from the case because it had entered into a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge in accordance with the request of avoiding the appearance of sustainability, partially due to a series of media conversations and public statements that openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The court decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they had wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics within their program of arrest and investigation of persons.
It established an independent supervision to monitor major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test cameras weared on the body in certain areas where the most frequent stops of persons occur.
In August, New York agreed to terminate the method of retention of names and addresses of people whose cases were denied after the police investigation.
The oral reasoning for the appeal of the city is sometimes planned after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of arresting and investigating persons have criticized a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, people have been arrested and searched for some decades, but checks recorded under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to the record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases it was Black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonging to the minority, recorded a complaint that became the case of a group complaint.
The supporters of the changes to the programme of arrest and investigation of persons carried out by the police department in NY claim that changes end unfair practices, increase the reliability and effectiveness of the police council and can affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that this will freeze money, but will not solve a broader problem when the police council is under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand people in the last decade.
The court noted that it did not end the practice of stopping and investigating persons that were constitutional, but reformed the way the police department’s investigations introduced in NY.
Five shopping malls are facing low visits
This is based on real estate advisory companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague Bohnics, the Cracovia Shopping Centre opens to the public, it will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
In the Czech Republic, there are now 90 major shopping malls.
Insufficient performance concerns about 20% of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large centers against the location and bad layouts, so too much pater or complicated and unprecedented arrangements of the center, or possibly dead places," said Michal Sotak from Cushman & Wakefield.
According to Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five business centers are facing low visits.
The main reasons include poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents or market mobility in a given location.
Some projects opened almost completely occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfied at the beginning.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and unwilling to change their shopping habits.
New business centers have to make more effort to ‘look’ their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
The availability of shopping centers is generally stable, according to Sotáka, even in some centers rises, because the renters were willing to cut off in the crisis from the renter and hire some units.
“But it is true that some projects that are not fully occupied have been opened recently, and the average availability is thus reduced (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opa, Shantovka in Olomouca),” Sotak added.
Shopping centers opened in the last two years have been marketed very slowly, according to Sylvia Samadi.
There is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is definitely a place for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called "convinience centres", focused on shopping and daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
According to Sotak, there is also a place for other shopping malls on the domestic market.
And it is for both small "service" centres, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, Czech Budějovice, Brno or Plzen have room for further growth," Sotak added.
In Prague, he sees space for a prepared shopping centre on the Victory Square, further with a clear potential of the streets Na Příkopa and Václavsky Square.
"Intensively develops the expansion of retail parks, allowing retailers to cover and expand to smaller cities for favorable rent and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or local shopping malls, respectively, their reconstruction such as the renovation of good business houses"
In the Czech Republic, 90 modern shopping malls are currently located with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rentable areas.
A quarter of all these shopping malls is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping malls, according to the number of renters, nine of them are in Prague, is based on data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from the UK and France, the Czech Republic is approximately 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson got on the phone to check his advice
Former publisher of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods of “naming in the phone, monitoring and confrontation” to confirm a fraudulent tip on the love relationship to which then Interior Minister Charles Clarke was involved.
State Representative Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey Court said News of the World captured in May 2005 false reports that Clarke was seen with her “attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspapers ordered private investigator Glenn Mulcairea to enter the Pawlby's voice box and enter her privacy, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The State Prosecutor indicates that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person who stands in front of the house and hopes that people will be smart outside, but a person who likes people to submit stories to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three ways to explore stories: telephony, tracking, and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the other one, he has to know about it.
What about the first?
Do you know how to get rid of the phone?
He says no, we say, but surely he knows.
The fame of a loving relationship involving Clarke was first captured by the reporting department for the NotW newspaper, when sources who were sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby were said, "You're wasting time, it's with Charles."
Recording with voice messages taken from her phone at at least three occasions was obtained in the Mulcairo House in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer, where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were called "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her ancestors received anonymous telephone calls that were asked for information about Paulby, said Edis.
In the meantime, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup monitored the movement of Mrs. Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice message in which he told her: "I have a story we're going to publish tomorrow and I'd love to talk to Charles very much about."
Mr Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as other significant characters, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
At the court on Thursday, Coulson was confronted with Mr. Blunketta for a lovely relationship with a married wife, while he himself met Rebecca Brooks who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks refused to join other persons in order to enter their phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to the phone.
NSA Revelation Increases Social Paranoia of State Monitoring
One peaceful day, in late August, the German police helicopter crashed over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
According to the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German domestic reporting agency, the purpose of the mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. predetermined guards, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claimed that the BfV office had hoped it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action launched a exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the U.S. National Reporting Director, reiterated that the United States would not use its foreign news opportunities “to steal the business secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker, began to uncover his valuable collection from secret surveillance from the United States, European governments and leading entrepreneurs no longer know whether they have to trust the director’s words.
According to reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying in Brazil’s oil company and has gained access to the data available by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, it has achieved a general paranoia on state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was listened for 10 years.
If it can be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are also potential entrepreneurs.
Snowden reviewed intensive cooperation between US reporting services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” said Oliver Grün, BITMI president, representing a small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
According to a survey issued in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial spying and data stealing, the United States is now at the same risk as China.
However, in the entire documentation revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence that the United States has transferred business secrets to foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and said it should try to limit its dependence on the United States:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
The German parliament calls for a vote that we should produce a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again.
This is not a road, says Hasso Plattner, the president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn’t let him die 20 years ago.
Everything is done in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scope and technical processing of U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking for some companies who so far believed that China is the biggest threat of monitoring.
There is a big turnover in cloud computing techniques, where European representatives in a wider manner realized that data stored in the U.S. falls under that jurisdiction and are therefore potentially attackable.
According to a survey conducted by the cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members after disclosure of the U.S. Prism has cancelled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP CEOs, says, “We have a new question for customers who haven’t been here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many high German actors argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to cut off their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at any cost.
That economic spying is done is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
“It’s a critical topic for many years and it has not changed significantly during the current debate,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF’s Agrochemicals.
Americans are spying on us at business and industrial level, as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Overall, business leaders do not wish to boast of the anti-remedies that have made to prevent the attacker from providing any advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB memory disk or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s car management, says that it’s a common practice for many years to collect before the mobile phone management meeting so that it can’t be used as a listening device.
The German BfV advises senior employees to consider whether using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign roads due to the risk that smartphones can be scattered.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be released.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,” BfV warns.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic spying by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate documentation reported in February in addition to Russia and Israel in the second row of criminals who participated in the hacker activity for economic reporters, right in China.
A member of the Council of the German risk-free company concluded that in terms of economic spying, France is “the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic news agency DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “Services know very well that all countries, although they cooperate in fighting terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believes he was killed
Parents of a young boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a devastated race spirit in his gymnasium, believes their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a rough spirit behind the tribes at the gym high school where he went.
Sheriff Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died in an accident, but the family of a seventeen-year-old young man refuses to do so.
"They're definitely convinced that their son was murdered," lawyer Benjamin Crump, represented by Kennetha and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as she said.
“They are convinced that it opposes logic, physical laws and also healthy sense,” Crump said.
They believe that it is to deny what really has happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
As usual, they sent their son to school, and he returned to them to the trap of the corpses.
Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he conducted a common investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unresponsive.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a consequence of a crime?
Moore announced at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they take me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I think there is a sufficient basis for normal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the original pitch indicated that Johnson died as a result of “semi-deceased.”
However, according to Moore, the second pitch indicated another cause of death.
“There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if he reveals sufficient evidence in the case of Johnson's death for an order to investigate a criminal offence or violate civil rights, he will ask the FBI to execute it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not immediately available for any comments on Thursday.
The Judge of South Georgia in the middle ordered the authorities to make available all videos from the surveillance cameras that investigators viewed.
The teenager's parents hope that the videos will contain a trace leading to revealing how their son died.
CDC Centre issued for schools of children's allergy directives
The Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in children’s food allergy at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of children of school age suffering from food allergy is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC Center found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The Directive contains information for schools about how the teachers and staff are aware of food allergies and how to react, if possible, to the allergic reaction.
Adrenaline is also recommended to schools – the most common use of the EpiPen auto-injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislative authorities have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children with an allergic reaction.
The child can say, “It’s like someone wrote to me in a language,” “I feel like I have a hair tongue” or “They know my tongue.”
Parents of intersexual children can choose "unseen sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third gender in children born with unlikely sex.
Newborn children will no longer be classified to either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any sex for such children, and allows them to indicate sex as "unsurprised" or "unspecified" on their birth sheets.
The purpose of the law is to stop pushing parents to make their child's decisions in a manner of action for the purpose of determining gender, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One of the BBC’s intersexuals for many years said, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'm going to be a fool created by a physician, kidnapped and devastated.
It is estimated that every year one of the 2,000 children is born, which is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of the group about 60 facts that are part of the diagnosis of sexual development disorder, which covers the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, genital glands (ovariacs or warts) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersexual may have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to identify gender, it is better to use the best available information and determine them, rather than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery is carried out, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determining problems, said the new German law “all looks like a good thing.”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery and then it can wait for the identity to develop.
Knowing how sexuality develops in a child is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The 2011 report to the European Committee described intersexuals as different from transsexuals or transgender people because their status is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary gender characteristics such as muscle volume, hair loss, chest and character, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital systems, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexuals and transsexuals in the field of employment, as well as the level of disturbance, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark in official documents of male, female or "third gender".
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “innocent” person in June when she won a court appeal to keep her status of “uncertain” sex to the end of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports besides M (man) and F (woman) and third marking, X, will have for intersexuals.
In neighbouring France, according to a report on France, 24 issues of gender are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed petitions to remove “gender theory” from school books.
The U.S. Catholic website online also defined against the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is attracted to a new state in which sex is the issue of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn the ruins of two other pillars of civilization.”
A newborn mother from Maryland also said to Baby Zones that she would prefer to see to award sex to children at birth.
“Familiarity itself is stressful and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female gender were called hermafrodites, according to the visual Greek, who had two genders.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a table that could be deleted and redesigned.
But now many doubt the ethical basis of surgery with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes decide incorrectly, because they don’t know how children will feel in terms of their gender when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you were not called a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The ongoing theory of how to treat children with unlikely sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who defended the opinion that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of “homosexuality” and argued that the social causes and impacts of the environment – as parents raised their child – influenced the child’s genes and hormones and created a child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/Joan, his theory became controversial.
Parents of the boy whose penis was damaged because of the wrong circumcision, recommended that his child be completely disturbed, removed his garments, and raised him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the fact was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he let the boy go back to surgery and married his wife.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “use this model” so far.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these operations were “unsatisfied with the result.”
It was also the case with Jima Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but unlikely sex systems.
Doctors weren’t sure if they had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man, they could never live a “satisfied life”.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from external organs and garlics and raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 he was sent to a plastic bow.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrible.
After birth, I was sterilized and no one told me anything.
Bruce was born with a genital development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to be able to develop its genital system properly.
After he learned the truth, he turned back to a man, took testosterone doses and left to remove his chest,
Operations caused his infertility.
Today, he represents other in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Legal Group of Advocates for informed choice, with headquarters in California, fears that the German law “assume to behave and stigma.”
“Many activists are afraid that the German law will reach the encouragement of parents to make quick decisions and choose ‘uncertainted’ for the child,” she said.
We are afraid that this will lead to intervention.
We believe it is better to award male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization was supported by Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be included in the third gender."
“A mature should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid sex,” she said.
The German law will be allocated to it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child shouldn’t have at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual development disorders and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law "giving power" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but DSD has a syndrome called androgenic insensitivity.
Because her androgen receptors are deficient, Katie's female characteristics have developed.
He has a vagina, but he has no uterus and ovaries.
Now, 29-year-old Katie is married and works as a practitioner in child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is unfruitful, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement maternity.
"The law gives parents a certain space to avoid making their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to perform certain tests and think about it, and gives them time to write “husband” or “wife.”
In this regard, everything is okay – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy with it.
You don't have to hurry with an operation that is irreversible.
“It gives them the opportunity to engage in decision-making as well as the child, and they take away the anxiety that parents associate because they are not sure they do the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child decides what sex is more identifiable with – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The beverage kissed the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension grew up, the fear grew up.
The man began to threaten that the whole house would be burning.
For this reason, all available police guards in the area, as well as the unit of the young Boleslavi guards and the unit of the assembly of the volunteer guards were out there.
There was also a police negotiator who tried to speak of his irrational behavior.
The man still threatened to burn the house.
So a intervention unit, which devastated men and slowed down, had to enter the house.
The aggressor then ended an investigation into a young adolescent hospital from where he was transferred to an alcoholic arrest station.
The hasicians eventually absorbed the house with a gasoline, which was later cleaned.
In addition to people, all pets were also rescued from the house.
He didn't give a man to the police negotiator, so he seemed to be a commander.
Report: Obama’s campaign plans to exchange Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest adviser of President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden’s 2012 candidate for Hillary Clinton.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the unexpected 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times issued a copy of the coming books and announced on Thursday evening that the president's summit co-workers had organized intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether Biden's release would help revive Obama's brilliant hope for reelection.
According to a national-political journalist for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough record of the efforts of leaders within the campaign and in the White House, namely former head office of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the impact of Clinton's deputy vice minister on the elections.
The potential change was strictly preserved by the secrets within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and within the Oval Workshop.
Only a few of the nearest presidential advisors – including Daley, the former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and the former chief advisors in the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was a representative of an attempt to replace Biden despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to take this step when the data showed that Clinton's adding to the candidate would "not significantly increase both chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration really considered Biden Clinton’s replacement.
“I’ve been exploring a lot of things intensively, and this was one of them,” Daley said.
You should not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we said, “Christophe, what should we do?”
While Daley characterized the research as “a proper care,” Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had spent little investment to find out if this tax was paid in the elections.
“The campaigns do not spend such money on elections and qualitative research unless something is really serious,” Martin said at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that Daley had asked if his former boss knew about this potential exchange of cards.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was aware of the potential changes, the former head of the office admitted that it was “possibly” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political sondage reached Obama at the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought he was seriously aware of the research related to Biden’s outbreak from the candidate.
"It's possible," said Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that lights in the dark?
The British entrepreneur made the first ice cream that lights in the dark – using medusa.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent characteristics of this sea animal and developed a brilliant pearl.
He came to the idea when he read his professional medusa negotiations, and convinced scientists in China to produce chemically a protein that causes lighting.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s language – it increases the pH level in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream lights when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, and so the more you lie, the clearer September.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicious” says: “It’s an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we’re at the beginning, so you’ll get about 2 g of this substance for £200.”
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream begins to shine.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween celebration because it causes this fantastic brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because lighting the medusa is four times more expensive than gold.
And that’s why every pocket cost me about £140.
But taste great.
Charlie’s experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its non-traditional taste of beer, cheese, chicken and gold tickets.
The next product is even more ambitious.
She says, "I really wish to make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it is impossible due to the roughness of the light caused by the crystal ice that forms the ice, but I count on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of medusa, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up for a long time and present with neighbors in clothing.
Today I feel like I've become a concern.
After two years, there was no sugar in my apartment and this year it would probably be different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), this year most Americans – in fact 158 million – will celebrate Halloween and lose $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations.
Every time I look forward to Halloween, these are trends.
According to the NRF, from $6.9 billion lost is expected to be 1.2 billion on costumes.
This year is the last shot of fashion sexy non-living objects.
Sexy can no longer be just women; sexy can be foods like pizza, hamburger and marble.
When it comes to men, I expect to see a lot of zombies thanks to the prosecution of the dead, and I bet the Daft Punk universe men will reach our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we weared our dogs in costumes and we were not the only ones in my admiration.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will lose $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So you will see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweetness, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will lose $1.9 billion.
It is about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lizard, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets, and Clark bacon.
This is an incredible report for 41 million colleagues who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are planning to cross our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy and don’t believe it, we consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn potatoes, and yet, according to the National Association, they are sold around Halloween by nearly 16 thousand tonnes.
It's about 9 billion corn potatoes.
It's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than terrible houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are in the United States officially dedicated 1,200 terrifying homes that, according to American company, earn $500 million terrifying homes, which include the amazing pictures that you’re confident of fear and give your friend on Facebook, and you can’t remove them and the person you like, “the guy who likes to look at the pictures”
And finally a little bit about the dunes.
When we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us a big duck (Great Pumpkin) and cutting a duck lighter is something like decorating a Christmas tree – we do it from a little bit.
Fortunately, the trend “kind in the smoke” started with the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up on the fact that we cut the rug instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People's Numbering Office, the US will lose about $106 million for a debt.
A dinosaur lighter with a flame on your front veranda is likely to come from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of dinosaur grew this year.
If you are looking for something extra, call Timon and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut off their dunes weighing almost one ton.
Released Land Rover Racing Series
The interior has racing seats and six-inch security belts, as well as intercommunications equipment.
The selection includes improved brakes, service packages that provide access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between each race.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants of the racing coming to Bowler have changed.”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also a reachable way to world-class races.
We are delighted to offer this journey to them in collaboration with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in the UK and the sea, and that it will prepare the competition for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid racing.
We really enjoyed the Defender Challenge development – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in northern Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have an early election
TOP 09 President Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting further early elections.
The last week in the interview for Aktuális.cz said there was no other east, and every government was taken from voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the lifetime of the starting election period for two years.
With the opposition to the next time voters hardly choose completely differently, they will not agree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, President TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections as this year (about 2010, about 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimated that if it would be clear that early elections would be, it would strengthen the 2011 ANO movement of Andreje Babishe.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
The turbulent situation in the Czech Republic, where President Bohuslav Sobotka after the secret chain meeting of the party’s leadership said he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg after:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party as young boys are following the head of the state to allow them to move on the side."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was more skillful and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so uncomfortable in my life," TOP 09 added.
And towards President Zeman (with whom he argued in the fight for the presidential role) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to power that party."
The first laws have already been introduced by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has formally submitted its first bills in the House, including the Faroe Registry of treaties, which were held before the elections by the House committees, but falled under the table with early elections.
The President TOP 09 in the interview for Aktuális.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, the TOP 09 obviously wants to track similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the ANO Movement leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of the idea of introducing the register of contracts "breaks" the ANO Movement program.
The TOP 09 is now using the oversight - it just oversighted the proposal that had already been enrolled in the second House reading.
Hashish units have come to save lost dogs who have caught 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff in the stonelome
Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, a man who was imprisoned in a stonel saw a dog.
Hasicians were salted on the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
He was released by firefighters who came to release him after he was in some way arrested at a dangerous cliff in a 15-meter stone stone area over the ground.
Nine-month-long Spanish Ruby fled after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived three days alone until he was released from the stonel on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the stonestone Flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small crash, he was warmly searching for his lost dog and putting challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, at about 14.15, he saw the birds of Ruby's wrapped up on a 15-meter stone stonel over the ground.
He hurried the technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station and sent down to release Ruby, while using him to pick up an animal transport bag on the rock.
Andy Clayton, expert commander of the technical rescue team, said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the midst of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the rest.
He wasn’t rescued – he was totally frozen.
But now he's okay.
And then he got the dryers.
It was a very unusual exit.
It's incredible to see a dog.
Peter Lau, expert commander of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had great luck during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for check-in, and besides exhaustion and dehydration was okay.
Mrs. Hall from Halifax in West Yorkshire said, "I was afraid to look at the rescue action."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The hasicians did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We were very grateful to them, we were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid he could fall, but he stayed there.”
The hackers were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that after 18 years of age, Katy Perry hasn't gone.
During an interview for the Australian radio series this week, this pope star said that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" in 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had a dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
She added, "It's been a long time ago and now it's very nice to me."
In a Thursday statement, Jagger's (70) representative said he categorically refused Katy Perry to make proposals.
The president said, "Maybe you've got him with someone else."
Perry was one of the host singers who appeared at the Rolling Stones concert show this year.
Her new album "Prism" was debut this week.
George Kerevan: Separated Europe gives Scots a choice
The next day, another terrible story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This led to the cause of the stories of passport controls in Berwick and the rough wire along the Hadrian valve.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper has mentioned the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as it was expected, it did not go into the titles of the newspapers.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if it suits them.
Since Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continuing non-compliance would be a cheap reduction for Brussels for whatever the Scots really want.
So that's a pretty weak story.
In addition, he was so old that he became a distortion. I've heard a reporter crash that "independence means passport control", I've heard at least 40 years ago.
However, one interesting idea is hidden in this spawned speaker.
Why should it be expected that Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why to replace the London Shomout for that Brussels, especially now?
This is a real European story: a big compulsory plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The impact of the euro crisis is the so-called Europe project officially dead.
On the other hand, Europe gains the influence of the party’s devoted resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came as if it had been a denial and had already established nearly five million votes in the federal elections in November, making the Bundestag essentially a “spoke” of the Free Democrats (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats).
On the home soil, there was always resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The resilience dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank along with the Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh-Kazakh
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are dealing with a high budget deficit – that was true only in Greece.
Instead, it is a euro system that blocks its members on exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to leave.
Without the possibility of devalving the domestic currency, South Europe has a disadvantage in the field of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to calculate income and public expenditure – which Germany urges.
The current problems with the budget and currency are the deeper cause of European low performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for petrol in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the area of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
The freezing of the world’s wages wouldn’t turn away the European petrochemical industry’s low-cost oil from the United States.
The result is a delightful rebellion, especially in France, when the EU's enthusiasts were excited.
After the war, the EU saw the political elite in France as a tool that would keep Germany on the ground and allow Paris to stand up in the world at the level of Washington.
Berlin is no longer in need of political legitimacy and has passed its own economic policy in Europe and has left the destiny of the French economy.
The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won the essential additional elections and sent the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now with 24% of the most popular votes in France – a time warning for British labourists that they can't deny that the left-wing is automatically positively expressed on the left.
How does Le Pen manage its newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use the European Parliament to create an anti-European block that acts against the common currency.
If anti-European parties take good decisions in these elections, which is likely, such a block can dominate for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
I believe that the growing anti-European feeling and attitude towards the common currency will be united and the euro will be lost.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn into something more free in the sense of “Europe (Sovereign) nations”, already preferred General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may take the euro, but France and South Europe will restore their own currency.
I hope that the UK will go away from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left behind by the Atlantic cold.
Where is Scotland?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – there is also the possibility of informing Berlin and Brussels when we should be left.
I suppose that Scotland would lead itself well in the liberalized arrangement of Europe, provided that it maintains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries would be easier in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The Government of the SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement that does not lead to savings in Europe, which has won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition position against the sharks that he planned (and implemented) Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalitions of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland would now choose independence only in order to take savings measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Hopefully puberty: Adults earlier
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white layer.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is coming.
There is no evidence that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it.
Experts claim that one of the starters of previous puberty can be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of previous puberty is not so visible in boys.
The former reporter of CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family problems.
Should a mother be scared when her daughters begin to grow in the breasts and to warm herself at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children’s Doctors in Orland, Florida, this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I have spent a lot of time making sure my parents are not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Seemable signs of development such as breast growth, dizziness on the stomach and in the underground and body smell, girls appear earlier.
In the last 40 years, however, there was only a small move at the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 years in 1970.
“When the breasts begin to develop, they will last at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping With This Common Problem”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the real start of puberty, but if growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight, the girl is considered "previously advanced".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be monitored carefully by children’s doctors.
Faster growth can be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests in order to exclude serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are therapeutic procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature bone aging, which may eventually lead to stopping growth and disruption in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the speed of development, the speed of growth and emotional maturity.
The psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to injecting drugs, Kaplowitz is careful, but admits that “suppression of puberty can relieve problems with the behaviour of a girl and her feelings that it differs from her colleagues.”
Of course, another major problem is: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried that she can be pregnant or how she’s going to handle hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” a woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came from the school home scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a related set of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media.
Boys, like girls, get puberty before.
Kaplowitz claims that the most important reason for obesity is the epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which combines body fat with time-consuming puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, the patterns of early puberty appear to be affected by all possible economic conditions through underneath to genes.
Another controversy: Although in boys at a low age already occurs warming in the face and at a bow, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as in girls.
Other doctors attending the Conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added further complexity to this subject.
Acne and swelling are common even in infants and baking.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real puberty," Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, said.
Parents should not dare to get instructions from their child doctor to talk to their child.
“It may mean you need to talk to your child before you expect,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls that develop earlier need to make sure that even if this happens early, this process is a common part of life.
Convalin in the role of economics.
He has a new job?
The actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared in the role of economics, and it was very important to her.
Would the Czech favorite actress plan to change the profession and make a business in the hostage?
Convalin's attack appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and rolled beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right now.
The boss even offered me to hire and I could feed by turning the beer.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I’m doing so far, with the actress,” she smiled Konvalinkov, a guest for the twenty-first anniversary of the Irish hospodship.
"I love Irish beer and here I'll give Irish whiskey too," she told her actress.
Nadi’s long-term friend and colleague Pavel New appeared at the event.
I am after death and I can’t be happy in my new life.
I have allowed one beer or one beer a day, and I'm trying to keep it up," he added.
Airplane manufacturers with a seat width, there are large contracts in bet
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, a dispute about the width of seats in the second grade for long distance flights has been burned, causing this month the cause of a heavy exchange of views on the Dubai airline show.
The object of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for remote economic classes – not exactly what airlines would usually prevent, but whose allocated space is the key to the claims of efficiency for the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus has called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide headquarters in an economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says airlines have to decide about it.
The dispute arose at the time when aircraft manufacturers competed to sell the largest version of their two-motor remote aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear part of the aircraft is distributed, particularly whether it is next to 9 or 10 seats, is the basis of economic performance claims for the designs of new “mini-jumbo” aircraft.
Boeing says the improved 777X model will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm distributed by 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 transports 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats distributed by 9.
Large planes often attack each other in technical issues through ads in professional media.
Airbus now before the Dubai Air Show, where 777X is expected to get overweight with more than 100 orders, calls directly to the public.
Recently, he showed preliminary what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financialists a picture showing three people in a restaurant entitled "Will you like it?"
“Boeing promotes remote flights in seats narrower than in regional turbo-headed aircraft,” said Airbus’ sales manager John Leahy.
As dietary vessels change, people are bigger, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern remote air transport, by the end of the century, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health, the average weight of the Americans aged 40 to 49 has increased by 10 percent.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a passport of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival holds the concept of seats from the 1950s when the average seat width of a newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that indicates that seat enlargement by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing rejects Airbus’ seat sizes and says it is not in power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat.
"It's really about providing airlines with flexibility and allowing them to do things they are convinced that they need to do it to be successful," said Kent Craver's cabinet expert.
They don't want us to dictate them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
It is essential for passengers to have a larger space for locks, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Under this dispute, the race in orders of planes with estimated trade in the next decades is worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to get rid of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that in their latest two-motor remote aircraft designs they achieve 20 percent better efficiency than the leading market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing’s performance demands depend in part on the comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in the row and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in the row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing does is to push more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, a leader for passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say cabs with 10 seats in the row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for denser distribution, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“Fourty-five centimeter wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus’s entrepreneurial point of view, the design is motivated by a threat of 777,” said Mary Kirby’s interior cabinet expert, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
The flight dealers even carry a measuring belt with them to check their competitive arrangements.
While we are proud of comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-dense arrangements for low-cost companies and regional travellers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in line, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Airbus recently emphasized the need for a greater cab adjustment by offering larger seats in the streets of some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of one more manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unexpected, but it can diminish the 777X sales wave.
The number of HIV-infected people exceeded thousands in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people increases annually.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later, 121 were already and 180 were already in 2010.
Last year there were 212 infected and it was a record number.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, I think no longer doubt," said an expert on the AIDS issue Miroslav Headaty, who for years led the Prague Lighthouse for patients.
According to him, 165 HIV patients arrived in the country from January to September last year, with 176 patients in the same period this year.
From the beginning of the monitoring until the end of September this year, HIV tests confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Middle East, there were 206 infected residents.
The diagnosis was heard by 156 people from the South Moravsky region, 130 from the Moravskoslezsky region or 116 from the Ústeckie region.
At least infected people came from high school, they were 19.
A total of 88% of patients were infected with sex.
14 people have been infected with blood transfusion in the past.
However, such a case has not been revealed in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, i.e. over a quarter of the century.
With HIV, six children were born, and they were transferred to their mother.
The insights in the film Gravity are, but watched is beautiful, experts say.
A fantastic film from the universe Gravitace was sold in the Czech cinema for a while after the premiere.
In October, it was seen by the Union's film distributors by nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the pictures positively.
Others, however, have some irregularities.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysicians about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some of the meanings that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of Astronomy and Planetária Brno): I like science fiction films that I consider as modern, dream stories.
The film Gravitation does not take advantage of it even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean it'd be bad.
I enjoyed him a lot.
You may notice Sandry Bullock’s hair, which isn’t in a state of difficulty.
Hubb's space television and International space stations are moving through significantly different circular trails, so they can't be seen in one picture.
Some spectators of the film count an unrealistic effect and entire behaviour of fire in a state of difficulty.
The skafandry would also not support such injuries.
The Gravitation films often get into a collision with various items and clothing without any major difficulties.
Criticism was not spared either.
Thus, the vast tragedy on the Earth's orbit is, according to some discussing, unreal.
It is also wondering why the doctor was sent to the universe to repair the technique.
People on forums also argue about "unreal" behavior.
It seems like it's designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Stars and Planetary hl. m. Prague): I have seen him only on a wide sheet so far, but I can clearly say, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost obligation) to not keep consistent reality.
"Better than you mentioned the irregularities, I was affected by how a space station has been shown three times with degrading levels of technology (latest Chinese)."
"China will be until the end of the decade and maybe look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Academy of Astronomy of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are trying to fail physical laws very successfully, and thus a naturally oriented admirer estimates that atmospheric regions, including atmospheric collisions and rains, are preserved atmosphericly well atmosphericly, atmosphericly, atmosphericly.
Disorders will certainly be found in a more detailed study.
In addition, for example, when I read comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of a different space shell on the circular path appears to be reversed in some scenes before it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Stefanan (employed of the Academy of Sciences in the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted to their needs, but no critical and prosecution against logic or natural laws I have not recorded in the film, and in comparison with other films of similar focus, it is seen that the images of the creations have made in the background.
From moments that don’t make sense it’s worth calling it the fact that Hubble’s space television is orbiting a differently shine orbit than the ISS.
The result is a significantly different mutual speed and the rescue operation could not actually take place as shown in the film.
Moreover, at the moment of Kowalsky (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) department, I did not notice that the entire ISS would rotate, so it is not even a clear source of the power working on Kowalskyo, which makes both actors leave at a time when they are no longer moving against each other.
A new nicotine vaccine can take pleasure from smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can remove the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence throughout life.
Before human tests, it is necessary to carry out additional tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal at the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
“We definitely hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine dependence is so strong to overcome all the current approaches,” Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been created to provide genetic information for the creation of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which will then begin to create a gas flow of these antibodies.
Antibodies persecute all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they enter the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine intervention.
In the tests of the vaccinated mice, to which nicotine was added, they continued their common activity.
But the mice that weren’t vaccinated “relaxed,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine entered their brains.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be administered so often to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so that they proved expensive and unpractical.
Costs of a new vaccine should be much lower because they turn liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people are completely safe, they could submit to children before they taste a cigarette and prevent nicotine dependence.
However, it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop it.
"They will know that when they start to smoke again, they will not have any use of the nicotine vaccine because of it, and it will help them get rid of this abuse."
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they warn that further research is needed.
Tripodi denied it would be influenced by Obeide
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for Corruption Surveillance.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three real estates on a controlled land.
The Independent Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbyed with several state ministers to rent him at the Circular Quay, where both had two restaurants and cafés, restored without having to participate in the auction procedure after his expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew the secret interests of Mr Obeid on these properties, on the basis of evidence submitted by the former representative of the Office of Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed us to rent in public competitions.
The renters were opposed to this and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rentals for businesses in Circular Quay, which contributed $2.5 million per year to Obeid, were restored without the need to participate in the public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially a public contest advocate.
However, he denied that the changes were made on Mr. Obeid's request, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, urged to move into government lease policy.
The ICAC calls report showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeidem and Tripodim and Steve Dunn, the chief official who arrived at the port resort after working under Mr. Obeidem in the Fisheries Department.
“Have you been the subject of conversations during these telephone calls on the development of commercial rental policy?” asked Mr. Tripodi’s Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy.
“No,” said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but certainly not that.
Surely not between me and Mr. Obey.
Israeli military airplanes attacked a target in Syria, the official said.
Israeli military aircraft reached a target on Thursday night at the Syrian port of Lazizia, the official official of the Fox News station confirmed.
This responsible agent did not specifically tell what the goal was, but he said he was at least one.
The press agency Associated Press said the target was the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least two times earlier this year, Israel made an air strike on missile delivery in Syria.
Many things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that he was able to agree with this, but the President of Štěch was distracted.
Hejtman Chovanec was suspected as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the poverty of ČSSD.
The other men showed mostly their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled, readily, and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek has prevented the most of the conversations on television.
On the basis of this, I don't see a better option than to propose the Czechoslovakia as Vice-President of the Senate with Gajdowski, the only one should not have an initial hendikep and I think it would lead to standard performance.
It’s a good solution that none of the leaders will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without disrupting the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could, without worrying, constitute a minority government with just a blessing from President Babis and without humans, but with the People's Health Minister Speaker, who is actually a believer social democrat.
This minority government should have a great stability, as it would implement a proper referendum law, and so it would be committed to supporting the President of Uzvit Okamura.
President Babiš would finally calm down with the progression of the tax, because he's smart and he'll see that it won't work without her.
People wouldn’t have problems because the Speech is the carrier of the best they have, and otherwise they wouldn’t be in the government.
The same applies to YES, there would be a valuable minister here, but if they reasonably do not want to enter a risky government participation, but provide support, they will also be well.
Let's give the courage of Alena Gaydosh!
Foreign workers with visa authorisation may undergo a “legability” test
As the government intends to extend police measures, it considers the “legability” test for foreign workers with visa authorisation 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied by mediation criteria to prevent the program 457 from being used to fulfill unqualified jobs, or as a rear door for the transfer of family and friends to Australia.
When a government debate was issued today, former labourist deputy Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric on foreign workers saying that it could hurt Australian neighbours.
"The good statements of 'expatriates at the end of the front' and 'working first for Australians' are a very unpleasant residue from the time the alliances demanded a protected labour market," the Australian-India Institute said.
Historically, it meant that white labor force had to be protected – and I wouldn’t wonder if someone in this region had recorded the resignation of this historical artefact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he talked to officials for the protection of people, implemented five of the recommended changes and others remained to be considered.
If the criteria of "legitimacy" are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "the nomination is entitled to a situation in which the candidate is in a relationship or in a personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring company."
Following previous experience with companies that intend to sponsor a small number of employees, but then employed hundreds, the number of visa holders may also be required.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, who was seeking asylum, died with a suspicion of heart attack after he arrived on his asylum boat on the Christmas Islands this week.
A nine-year-old dreaded son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death, he was comforted by an adult cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities and the man hurried to a hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
The British government announced a study aiming to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
Minister of Transport, baron Kramer said the project “will join the UK together”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he had been working with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of the new high-speed train lines between London and West Midlands.
After completion of Phase two, it will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reviewed the estimated cost of building high-speed lines between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted interviews with the National Transportation Office Scotland, entrusted HS2 to discover further rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baronka Kramer said, “Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects Britain and its cities.”
We have given SH2 green because the benefit that will bring it is huge.
Without that, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also linked – through the UK, HS2 will be better linked to 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr. Carmichael called for "explicitly" supporting Scottish integration into the HS2.
Mr. Brown said, “The high-speed line has the potential to bring Scotland disproportionate economic benefits, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain.”
We are so excited to work with the British government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed railroad to Scotland and thus bringing all benefits and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government plans.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study along with the British ministers in the next year and to joint decision-making on the next steps.
Bartha and the anti-corruption police analyst are arrested.
Welcome Barty started spreading on Thursday evening, when the message was brought by the server of Privnízpravy.cz.
The MF DNES has found that the case was taken over by the General Security Inspection Assembly (GIBS), its people had to arrest Bart in the center of Prague.
This happened before the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection addresses cases where there are accused police officers, but its power applies also to civilians.
According to the MF DNES, one of the arrested officers of anti-corruption police is Jan Petržílek, head of analyst and computer science.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
Jaroslav Ibehej, spokeswoman of anti-corruption police, refused to comment on information with the addition that the media had to turn to the GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokeswoman Radka Sandor, who did not want to say anything about the case, responded to the City State Representation in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of hidden facts," said Stephen Zenklov, spokeswoman.
Also from this non-concrete reaction can be taken away that the event took place, but it is in a secret mode that speakers do not allow to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart’s lawyer Oldřich Poverty.
The media said that Bartu was representing "and in this matter", but because it is a secret information, Bart's arrest cannot confirm or reject.
Some media first speculated that Bárt's arrest could be linked to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted by Bart, along with the former President VV Radk John, who was headed by the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute that was burning between Prime Minister Peter Netempo and VV had even to deal with the former President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship with my person took place.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," iDNES.cz Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became a police boss.
He was officially appointed by Radek John, the real head of the party, but Bartha was at the time.
Bartha was now a candidate for the elections for the Úsvit movement, and the MP's mandate escaped him just strictly - by 175 votes.
Tomio Okamura’s leader said he didn’t know what it was.
“Greetings to Bartha were one of many candidates to our candidate and, as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Tomia Okamura Direct Democracy Association,” he rejected Bartha Okamura, who said before the elections he gave Bartha the room to apply for the candidate because he helped solve the problem.
Vít Bárta joined the court in 2012 with his former partner at VV Jaroslav Škarka.
The rules on the use of electronic equipment in an aircraft remain in Australia until now
Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during the start and landing even regardless of changes in the United States in order to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Air Administration (FAA) has given U.S. airlines space to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games during the critical phases of the flight if the device remains in the "Lettician" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are poisoning that they can’t have access to their electronic books during the start and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a large piece of work from American carriers to meet those requirements, but pointed out that they are not planning to change their practices soon.
The Office for Civil Aviation Safety (CASA) also said that the notification was examined, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in an aircraft,” he said.
This question is covered by regulations required by aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained all the time and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about the extension of the use of its spatial entertainment system wi-fi, has been encouraged to change, but has announced that the regulatory authority’s decision is subject to it.
“We would like to welcome if the CASA Office conducted an analysis of permission to use electronic devices because we really think that it would improve customer experiences now that we have (free board entertainment),” the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will continue to comply with current regulations.
“Our current policy is such that electronic devices should not be used during the landing and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon,” he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in the developments in the regulatory field that can be useful for our passengers, and we will certainly carefully examine the FAA decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of U.S. air carriers, the impact of the regulations will differ from the company and will depend on the age of their air park.
Transporters will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruption of mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, manual luggage programs and passenger information.
“As soon as an airline confirms its fleet’s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any overseas height,” the FAA said.
In rare cases, low visibility of the crew orders passengers to disable the equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in a storage space above the head.
With the growing poverty of middle class, flagships live in Singapore flowers
At the Bendemeer Shopping Cent in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga’s gold ring, ring and earrings stops to pay his daughters for school.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I gave all my money to it," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although each month as an administrator receives $2,400 (3,000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across Southeast Asian regions – where household debt increases – is actually such that ValueMax, where a woman performs her transaction, has become the third flag on the bankruptcy in Singapore this week.
The ceasefire of jewelry is not just a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The flags in Singapore typically apply an annual 17 percent percentage rate, just above 15.4 percentage rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch at the same shopping mall.
However, flags have the advantage that they do not require verification of a person (payment history) or income documentation, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And so, with the pressure of families on the rising cost of life and on the rising debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to flagships.
After five years of huge growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by the liberalized monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-sized income turn to the flag to deal with the worsening financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited increasing use of home loans, mainly due to increasing lease as a risk factor for Asian banks’ credibility.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia in view of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is headed by a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, which is an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also afraid of high levels of debt in Thailand, which just got out of technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a ongoing weakness in exports and weakening in consumer demand.
“It’s important that the rising costs of people from the middle to the low [favorable scale] will endeavour to complement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the CIMB Malaisian bank.
Historically high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are temporarily stopping their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items flagged in 200 city flags are gold.
People say, the price of gold looks good, we'll stop grandmother's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its flags in recent months.
Growth in the flag industry is so big that ValueMax, a Bendemeer branch operator and 15 similar branches in Singapore, intends to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60% of the 66 million SGD that it won on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discredit creditors have suffered criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the flag offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers stop items that they already own, and paying a personal property does not increase their home debt,” he says.
In the company, the flag of assets is increasingly accepted as a means of providing short-term, secure financing.
In addition, among those who use flagships are not only financially distressed people.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold brides or Rolex watches, so they can reach up to 60% of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are in all possible terms.
“They are rich individuals who need to borrow short-terms because of their brave businesses or investments, or small businesses who need help to solve problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare
The federal government is striving to provide a $325 million rescue package for overthrowing healthcare in Tasmania with harsh conditions to ensure that the government does not provide funding.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersekova, said that the Australian union is making “accelesive measures” to counteract the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The financing for four years was decided after government consultations with an independent Tasmanian deputy Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package that, as we believe, will solve the specific problems that the state faces," Plibersekova said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million per operation on the patient’s request.
Other 2600 operations including orthopedic operations and grey-crash operations will help to eliminate debt.
Money is also available at freely accessible clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-surgery care, training professionals, mental health services, and introducing personal electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the thoughts leading clinical doctors told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system,” Plibersekova said.
The Ministry stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting regime and recording duties.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive Australian Union funds and to inform each month where additional funds were spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million wouldn’t be worth anything “unless a real reform will be followed in order to set a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for the response to his request for accelerated assistance, which he for the first time offered in negotiations with the President of the Government at the beginning of May.
"I believe that the federal aid package will be able to release public health from a critical state," Wilkie said.
According to the governments, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Peter Dutton, spokeswoman of the Federal Opposition in the field of health, believes that today’s declaration is just “plasma”.
“The reason I am here is that the labour government pulled $430 million out of our medical system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a government that takes nearly half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union that spends $300 million, and make it a good news.
Mr. Dutton invited Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that none of the dollars of the rescue package would be issued for higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the novel of Denise Diderota, bringing an exceptional film tour and creating time, but it is also boringer than it should be.
It opens in the 1960s in the 18th century in France, and tells about Suzanne, a young cousin who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When he wakes up, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally cruel mother introduced and becomes an object of sexual passion for another.
The film never turns out to be sensitive or sensitive, and that’s his problem.
The martyrdom of this story leads to the fact that even viewers will experience the skin-like wear of a veined shirt.
Skiarries want to dismiss families with children
Syria has destroyed its means of chemical weapons production, the supervisor says
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, the Committee on Global Surveillance of Chemical Weapons said Thursday, while striking conflicts in the north of the country broke out, near one of the places where poisonous substances are supposed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The Statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came on November 1st.
the term established by this organisation based in Haag to Damascus for the destruction or disability of all chemical weapons equipment and machinery for mixing chemicals in order to create a poisonous gas and fill the ammunition.
The completion of this initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to start the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
It is assumed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons including yperite and nervous gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when battles in Safira on Thursday, which experts talked about as the headquarters of a chemical weapons and storage factory, said the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in the United Kingdom.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through the Syrian network said 120,296 people died on Thursday.
There are 61,67 civilians, including 6,655 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Assad, 18,678 ruling fighters and 187 armed forces from the Lebanese Hezbollah.
There are also 2,202 government overseers and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of which are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimates that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s units fought in Safari against rebels, many of whom are connected to Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observer said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific figures.
The fight against the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors who have to get rid of the chemical arsenal in the middle of the Syrian Civil War, have to deal with narrow terms.
In a statement by the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, it said that its team is now “satisfied that it has verified – and monitored – the destruction of the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling.”
He added that “no further control activities are currently being planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that these two places were “released and ... items of the chemical weapons program contained were moved to two other declarated places that were verified.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of the places OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has approved a plan for the full destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW Office next month.
“I appreciate the courage and courage that you have demonstrated in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organization ever had,” said observer director Ahmet Uzumcu in a commentary issued by the OPCW Office.
Now, in its third year, it stands against each other in the civil war, mainly the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Asadov government with its security forces, full of members of the Alawite sect, from Shiite Islam.
As regards further developments, Ramí Abdul Rahmán, chief of the Observatory, said a massive explosion occurred on Wednesday within an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazio.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger on the judgment on the founder of the bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a 2002 bombing attack on Bali responded seriously to the sentence issued over the last of the founders who were constructed before justice, saying Umar Patek had to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years fleeing as one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for compiling the explosive device used in the bomb attack.
In 15 years he could be conditionally released.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other points of terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombing attacks on Indonesian castles at Steady Night in 2000.
The accusation demanded a lifetime, although it could take a man named Demolition Man (breaker) to receive death penalty thanks to his reputation of an explosive producer.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost their 39-year-old twin Jane and Jenny in the devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders nearly ten years ago.
With tears in the eyes she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go to the traces of the others.
For the AAP agency, Ms. Corteen said, "It should be built in front of the recruitment board."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see any other grandchildren and daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when, on October 12, 2002, a strong load was burned out shortly after 23 p.m.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where only 20 seconds earlier the suicide bomber fired a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into the coma for a month, and while kept alive, he died three times to doctors.
Mr. Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cells of Islam responsible for the massacre — Amrozi, Muchlase and Ima Samudra — who were killed four years ago.
This guy should get death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... There's no reason to keep him alive.
Get 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others, it's not so much.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the killers in Bali.
The arrest was avoided for nearly ten years, but was finally affected in the city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where the U.S. forces killed former leader of Al-Qaida, Uzam bin Ladin, after less than four months later.
During the court, FBI agent in his testimony said reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bin Ladin in an attempt to reconnect terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Ms. Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how sad he caused others.
Verdikt comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“We will see a lot of tears this year,” said Corteen.
Patek may still appeal to the judgment.
FAA: Aerial passengers can now use technology in aircraft (but they must not call from their mobile phones)
Air carriers will be able to use their electronic devices from gates to gates – except calls from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies, and listen to music on the basis of the unpaidly expected new rules issued by the Federal Air Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers do not expect the changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced, according to individual airlines, FAA manager Michael Huert said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate to the FAA how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training guidelines for the crew and the storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of mobile electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already transmitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the extensive use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft’s door is closed.
They cannot turn on until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain does not grant permission.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane falls down to land and not turn them off until the plane is on the ground.
According to new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic disruption can allow their passengers to use their aircraft during the landing, landing and departure.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been adjusted to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher sea heights are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“As soon as new rules are safely introduced – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
Sincerely, we are tired of looking like “a watcher.”
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and SMS or downloading data will continue to be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be announced to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into the air mode.
So there is still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as well known, taken out of American Airlines's aircraft because he refused to turn off his aircraft when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored for concerns that they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
FAA may cancel the ban on some electronic devices during the departure and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the State Committee on Transport Safety, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones are still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interruptions with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interruptions in the air,” Rosenker said.
The regional advisory committee created by the FAA to examine this problem last month proposed that the government enables a broader use of electronic devices.
Pressure has been developed on the FAA in recent years to mitigate the limitations of their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, say there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult because the use of such devices is everywhere.
Some studies indicate that up to one-third of the passengers also forget the obligation to disable or ignore their equipment.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radio, a technical era of that time.
New airlines are much more disabled on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but are also built and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interruptions.
For years, airlines have offered passengers to use Wi-Fi at overseas altitudes.
The plans adjusted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
A large majority of airlines should be adapted to more use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasts than it was in previous generation devices.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimum transmission when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those who press to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company charged the transport aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and carried out a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding whether these facilities constitute any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Airline Passenger Association said he is convinced that disruption from these aircraft is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause air systems disruption, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA pilots allow passengers to disable the equipment during the flight according to the equipment with low visibility.
The tourism industry group welcomed these changes and, according to it, it is a reasonable procedure for the passenger public, which technology uses to a large extent.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security,” said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Birds were flying from a greenhouse in the North Sea and returned to nature
The bird was transported on the shore after being found exhausted on the oil plate in the Black Sea, and released back to the free nature.
One crash was transferred last month by a helicopter to Aberdeen after he was previously treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue center until he was healed.
Colin Seddon said: “This was likely to migrate from northern Europe when it was captured by a strong wind over the North Sea.”
According to all of his strength, he found a place of refuge on the oil plate.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
At the time when he was released, he was in good condition and injury.
Is the European elite ready to trade with the UK?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to connecting businesses and defining what changes in EU-related relationships British entrepreneurs and jobs-creating companies want to see.
For this purpose, we launched the largest and most complex survey in which the leading British entrepreneurs asked their opinions about the UK, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British companies of various sizes and from various sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a lot of surprises.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than breaking into the long and ambitious process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked their opinions on specific political areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
It was a general disagreement with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulation now override the benefits of being a part of the European trade area – even 40 percent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European society, expressed their consent.
Finally, our survey of leading companies revealed the most outstanding knowledge, and that the clear majority wants Britain to strive for a change in the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not on politics.
According to the findings identified by companies of different sizes and the main entrepreneurship group, the entrepreneurship sector is pushing on a "significant change" that will bring the impact back to Britain.
There is a lot in the bet – achieving an amendment to the treaty and a better deal for the UK can make up to 16% profits when voting in a EU referendum for stay.
The President of the Government should not be afraid: this survey shows that the UK trade supports its plan to novelize the conditions of the UK membership in the EU.
This also indicates that the entrepreneurial sector expects that this novelization will be a significant move from the current balance of forces back to Britain.
A better deal for the UK is possible and, given the way the eurozone is issued for a narrower economic and fiscal union, even more necessary.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, businesses will refocus on trade and significant changes in the Brussels regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted: Spy went too far!
The U.S. sent sometime "too far away," according to AFP, John Kerry, head of U.S. diplomacy during a video conference between Washington and London.
But, according to the Minister, the collection of information serves to reject terrorist attacks.
According to AFP, "The first confession from Washington" sounded in the middle of a sharp strike on both sides of the Atlantic due to a scandalous disclosure of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which also became a member of the U.S. allies.
“In some cases, I admit, as President Barack Obama did, some of these events have gone too far and we make sure that this will not happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended up to date practices.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for combating terrorism and preventing attacks such as attacks from September 11, 2001 in the United States, assaults in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings exploded, and people were killed because we were able to be informed in time about the savings," Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone disproportionately far".
A warrior around American intelligence, which allegedly watched millions of telephone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, Americans also watched the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide disturbances and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict monitoring.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria starts a new era of gas
The launch of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest energy projects in Europe, Gazprom said.
"We are witnesses of the border: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun today," President Gazprom Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed.
As soon as the entire project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted price.
Gazprom says the construction in other countries will start at the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
Waiting is a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Movement of Hizballah has placed 15,000 fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the Kalamuno-high region.
According to clear reports, Israel is still destroying missiles intended for Hezbollah in two locations in the west of Syria in the middle of attacks.
The Lebanese Shiite organization fights on the side of the Syrian army.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which is not interfering in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said it would prevent the movement of weapons into the hands of Hezbollah to Lebanon.
Reports of central Israeli attacks on weapon warehouses in western Syria are only clear.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean area have been carried out by the Syrian rocket base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
The al-Arabia reporting station said two warehouses in which the missiles were prepared to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, it was a missile of Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Jishi said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizbollah with missiles and that the Syrian airline teaches members of the armed division of Hizbollah to treat missiles.
The SA-8 is an elderly missile that has had the Syrian Army since the 1980s.
They are placed on a movable conveyor.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, it is easy to hide them.
They are equipped with a radar, which is disabled after the fire, so it is difficult to focus on them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in the area of the governmental alliances.
It is a well-protected region and Hezbollah has participated in the battles in western Syria in the past.
He claims it helps to protect the Syrian Shiite community, which belongs to the alliance.
It is now alleged that 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help bring the army back to Kalamun.
The Syrian army, along with Hezbollah, also strengthens its troops there.
Kalamun is located between Damascus and the third largest city of Homsem.
The battle, according to al-Arabia’s sources, is led by the recent attack of the opposition on the Syrian Shiite brigade of Abu Fadel Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army rebuild the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many rebels from Kusajr just left Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wished premature elections.
As a reason, corruption, disruption of money for prejudiced purchases and public procurement, tax increases and, in the end, government scandals.
According to the results of the elections, it is possible that most citizens meet this condition.
The fact that they did not go well and that the state that was there (the decreasing and debt of this state) was actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I can’t explain that 3,413,497 voters failed to vote, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted therefore a total of 4,394 028 voters voted for the original government coalition, which represents 52,16% of all legal voters.
Which is the over-half majority.
When 1 016 829 Czech Republic voters are added to the above-mentioned parties, then with an old order (because all those parties participated in the "disambiguation" and debt of this State), then 64,23% of legal voters agreed to this condition.
In fact, the majority of the voters said that they were not for punishment for the guilty to stealing and submitting this state.
Or do you think that the members of the Czech Republic who participated in this are taking into account the relevant laws?
Is he really helping us?

The Royal Commission found that two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) were accused before prosecutors against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children found out that before a charge against a child educator Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse.
But before the Commission, it was noted that in its introduction statement to the Commission, the association stated that they had never addressed the case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
Phillip Hare was questioned about the case when one of YMCA employees was charged with child pornography crimes, and another when a YMCA athlete was sentenced to the 1991 YMCA athlete for the sexual disturbance of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, Commission Advisor, that he knew the first case, but not the second case.
He admitted that the initial declaration of the YMCA was also inexact when it was stated that YMCA had conducted external audits that assessed the organization as the leading defender of the rights of children.
The evidence submitted by the Commission talks about the fact that YMCA was noted that, in the audit of the Ministry of Education and society from August this year, she received the second lowest of four possible ratings.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the guidance from him alone failed when Mr. Lord accepted without making sure that the staff is aware of the obligation to report breach of children's safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced for sexual harassment of 12 boys committed in two years when he worked in the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr. Hare refused the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that defended staff to report child safety disruption by Mr. Lord.
The members of the staff provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that Lord was alone with their children, in addition to watching them, leaving them sitting at their knees, telling them that I love them, and keeping them playing with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under Lord’s authority and asked for children’s safety training because she was worried about his behavior, proved that Jacqui Barnat, the leader of the children’s service at the YMCA in Caringbah City, was “very scary and often difficult to talk to him.”
The Director-General said he did not accept the proof of the staff that they felt uncomfortable if they should contact their supervisors and notify their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord darked their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the YMCA Council in New South Wales made his opinion that the teaching of the “Jonathan Lord” for the organization is that the staff “did not report” and the council agreed with it.
Mr. Hare said the decision to leave the staff to sign a silence agreement shortly after the accusation appeared, was made by YMCA’s child service manager Liam Whitley.
He said that the goal was to avoid the disruption of evidence, but he was "overwhelmingly cruel" and misconducted.
Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in the collection, verification, employment, training and management of staff.
The hearing was resigned on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance to return to the office of Prime Minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
In a night interview at the opportunity of his fifth anniversary of leaving the 59-year-old politician’s office, he expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned in the lead position for ten years, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks about British policy and his comments on foreign affairs and his role as the ambassador of the BiH Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of the Prime Minister, his reply to the London newspaper Evening Standard quoted: “Yes, of course, but it’s probably hard to happen that, so...”
While in Cardiffu were gathering a group of experts for horses to fight for the Prize of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
No one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he did not go to school yet and made his first steps just a few months ago, this boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly dropped three wheels to finally get the main prize and left behind 30 pulls with adult rivals.
This inseparable couple – with the same height – was praised for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition operated by the Sunnybank Ride Center in the village of Rudry near Cardiffu.
He stood against men and ladies in elegant hats, wrapped his bar in a joyful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee walk through the circle.
Fenton was praised for his natural ability to control horses, which far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest signs for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was born in March to his third birthday, and since then he exercises with this Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee work greatly."
They did not make great hopes, but finally they left with golden cups and chickens.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone was considered to be a phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to photograph with him.
The boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes on tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who is presenting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells says, “There was an exciting atmosphere, and everyone encouraged and stumbled.”
He ran through the sand throughout the length of the arena and even though he was so small, he gave great performance.
Fenton is an occupied animal – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he takes care of two chickens.
As he started, he will soon be back at the Year's Horse competition and I'm sure he'll get well.
He said: “Fenton is only three, but he already knows how to control the pony.”
They create a great team together.
The judges took Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed at the competition round.
They’re always watching how good teamwork is between the pony and the one who leads him – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's nice clothes were really in there.
Too bad newspapers should be investigated.
China’s newspapers, which on the headline requested the release of a reporter accused of the prosecution, will be thoroughly investigated, the press official said.
New Express, headquartered in Guangzhou, made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took charges to invent stories about the company partly owned by the state.
The director said New Express would now make a "full repair".
The regulation for "repair" came from the State news for press and publications, radio, film and television in the province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that in the period from September 2012 to August 2013, the New Express from the Yangcheng Evening News group issued several false reports about Zoomlion.
"The New Express's publishing leadership was unorganized," the director said in his statement.
He said he had to decide “to impose Chen Yongzhou’s administrative penalty in the form of abolition of the journalistic license”.
He also "commanded the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out the overall correction of New Express, and recommended to examine the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the leadership of the New Express".
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles regarding financial irregularities in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspapers issued two requests for his release on the home page and claimed that he was worth his paperwork.
However, Mr. Chen then appeared on public television and admitted that he had issued false stories for pay.
“In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and the whole media industry and its ability to gain confidence to the public,” he said at the CCTV state news station.
I did it mainly because I was looking for money and reputation.
I realized I was wrong.
After excuse, Mr. Chena issued a New Express paper on the title page of an apology in which he stated that he failed when he failed to carry out adequate control of his messages.
Recently, a number of suspects have been admitted on television.
Experts say that the confessions are still being forced regularly, regardless of the change of this year’s law, which prohibits authorities to force anyone to blame themselves.
It has been found a drug passing tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad.
One of the most deliberate drug passing tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico, filled with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railroads, was found.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel of dimensions about once a meter as one of the most intentional secret roads they’ve ever discovered.
The tunnel, which is clicking in the length of nearly six football clubs, connects a warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses where trucks can be easily hid before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities stated that the tunnel was closed before the drugs could be transported unobserved in it.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also arrested eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men who worked as drivers were complained of holding marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute it.
In the event of a sentence, he faces punishment of removal of freedom from 10 years to life.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, the turkeys penetrate extensive distortion channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest hall found in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after marijuana collapse in Central Mexico, which raises a problem in front of the drug cartridges to get their product to consumers as soon as possible.
In 2010, the authorities found a trail of about 650 meters in length, equipped with trains, leading from one house’s kitchen in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economy and Centre connect management.
For example, they offer common advertising.
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague.
The company Economia has taken another step to transform the holding center into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economia and Centre has a joint top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the staff union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media house," comments Vice-President of the Economy Chairman and authorized Director-General Kamil Čermák.
The pump, which will be headed for a single management, will be complemented by the CEO of the Center Holdings Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the trade was named Pavel Vopařil, who was also subject to the advertisement director of the two companies Zuzana Tylčer.
The new boss of information technology became Stephen Burd.
The joint director of the editing is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team is also the director of transformation Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts, a newly established marketing director, was entrusted.
The independent corporate communication department is newly managed by Vera Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers led by Petra Slabá.
"A new organizational structure will, among other things, enable us to come into the market with a common offer of advertising products, better link the content of all the titles issued and, in the latter end, further significantly effective business management of the company," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by finance Znenek Bakala, concluded a contract for the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries by the end of April this year.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktually.com, Žena.com, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands of Centrum.com and Atlas.com and SMB agencies.
Economia is the publisher of Economic Journals, the news server IHNED.cz, Respect and Econom weekly and the number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers is the long-term most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles.
In June this year, the publisher moved to newly built modern spaces in Prague.
CME focuses on television businesses.
Nearly a quarter of the people will be missing.
The CME media group will leave.
By the end of the year, he wants to beat a thousand people.
To cut off all side activities and to focus only on its main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of the people will work.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds a license for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smichov, Teleka and Czech MTV music stations.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for domestic TV TV Nova, is not clear yet.
"It's premature and we can't really comment on it," said Novy's Communication Director Josef Koukolikec.
According to MF DNES, the significant release of the Czech Republic will certainly not escape, but it should have the greatest impact on the staff of the CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new heads of New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined Adrian Sarbu’s long-term director, during the Wednesday conference talk with analysts, talked about their wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
Therefore, it is quite likely that it will significantly limit, in particular, the costs of production of its own series, filming and production activities.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, the cooling tower burned at night.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, a large-capacity warehouse has been burned, apparently a cooling tower.
"The fire was fired on Thursday, 11:00 a.m., and the fire was still burned this morning," said the spokesman of Prague, Pavlina Adamc.
The quantity of harmful substances in the air as measured did not exceed the permitted limits.
The damages and causes of the fire are still unknown.
Around five dozen hammers have gradually reached the Kolbeno Street area.
"This is a fire of a large-scale warehouse, probably a cooling tower," said Adamc.
"There is no functional hybrid network in the area, so we're breaking through a transportation guide from tanks," she said.
According to server tn.cz, hacking had complicated the malfunctioning network of hydrants, so hackers had to carry the water off.
The commander of the intervention has declared the second stage of firefighting.
A total of four are gradually, in the most serious situations, the fourth is declared.
The chemicals were also expelled to check the level of dangerous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure in the air the amount of harmful substances that would exceed hygiene standards," the spokeswoman said.
British police issued Assange’s release notice
The British police issued an announcement to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found a refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had delivered a "release notification" by asking him to go to the police station and that if he does not, he could threaten arrests.
Assange, under the British law, exacerbated its possibilities when the Supreme Court cancelled his appeal against release this month, facing the issue to Sweden for allegations of sexual crimes.
Because he was worried that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he searched for an asylum on June 19 at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where the South American country requested asylum.
Scotland Yard “have documented a report of the release of a 40-year-old man he asks to enter the police station the day and hour he was assigned to,” the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of the savings.
The Embassy refused to comment on the release notice.
Assange is afraid that Sweden will be issued to the United States, where he can face spies because he has published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on WikiLeaks website.
The driver received a fine of 1,000 pounds for riding over 200 km/h with hot beverage between legs
The driver received a fine of 1,000 pounds for walking up to 210 km/h with a hot drink located between the feet.
Andrew Howie, 35-year-old from Tiptree in Essex, was invaded on May 27 at his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out that she had a beverage between the stairs.
In Colchester's police court, Howie admitted to being accused of driving unprecedented and unprecedented.
Seven points came to his account, resulting in a six-month ban on proceedings.
Howiem was also ordered to pay the costs of 90 pounds and a charge for the accused 100 pounds.
As a result of tax on foreign real estate owners, London bubble breaks
The Ministry of Finance pre-evaluated the income tax, but waits for the final decision of Mr. Osborn, which in the 2012 budget represented a 7 % charge for the transfer of real estate for buildings at a price of more than £2 million and annual charges for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
Revenue from the transfer fee for property in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeds the total total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northeast and Yorkshire and Humber as a whole.
Mr. Cook said, “In view of the increase in the transfer of real estate to homes of high value and the presentation of related legislation, which should prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that assets of high value are little taxed regardless of the effect of the old-fashioned system.”
He added that “this step could cause some foreign investors to be able to buy real estate in London or, if possible, to be able to sell existing owners.”
The front real estate – top 5 to 10 % of the housing market by price – in the rich band from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded 11.8 % in the last year.
Prices in mid-London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6 % a year since the year, but have been sharpened by the growing “ domestic market” in which, according to a survey of Savills’ real estate offices, have experienced an increase in the southwest, the north (7.4 %) and the east (6.5 %).
Scientists have more illuminated how the movements of the oak are associated with the mood of a dog
Earlier research has shown that happy dogs climb more traffic (with the view of the dog), while nervous dogs climb mostly to the left.
However, scientists now say that other dogs are able to detect and respond to these subtle differences in the movement of the oak.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and the right side of the brain has a different link to the inspiration that stimulates positive or negative emotions.”
We have tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that the right side of the brain is responsible for left movements and vice versa and that these two semi-sphere play a different role in emotions.
In order to get more information about how dogs respond to the disproportionate rotation of other dogs’ hooks, researchers monitored animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the top frequency of these animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It will probably take a long time before we understand why their cords sometimes go on one side, and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have provided dog films about dogs, whether in a natural version or in the form of a silhouette, to get rid of any stubborn incentives, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the cord and show it more right or left.”
When the animals saw another non-significant dog moving with an oak to the right (with the view of the dog roaring with an oak), she remained completely calm.
However, when she recorded the rotation of the oak mostly left (return from the point of view of the dog rotating the oak), their top frequency increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would communicate consciously through these movements.
Instead, it is believed that dogs have learned from experience what movements they have to move and which they have to be careful.
“If you meet dogs several times, and the movement of their hooks in one direction is repeatedly linked to rather friendly behaviour, and the right movement produces less friendly behaviour, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and coaches to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, a dog behaviour expert at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to investigate whether the left and right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a Lincoln University team found that dogs turn their heads to the left when watching an aggressive dog, and right when watching a happy dog.
And in another expert negotiation from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “I do with a robot, the dogs were more likely to meet when he climbed with a hip left than the right when they became uncertain – precisely the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to him, the difference can be given by the fact that dogs in these different studies did not explain the animals in movies or dog robots as dogs.
He explained that it could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“Although in the case of many different scholars, there is evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are not an exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behaviour, it will probably take a long time until we understand why their shells sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys Release Concert in Glasgow for Alex Turner's Disease
The rock group Arctic Monkeys launched a concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with inflammation of the throat.
Sheffield's team was scheduled to attend the Hydro city complex on Friday.
Alex Turner's main singer's disease forced her to move.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to delay its Thursday performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys Group said: “After deciding to delay today’s LG presentation in the Birmingham Area and on the basis of medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys Group must also delay the presentation at the Hydro complex in Glasgow planned on Friday, November 1.
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with inflammation of the necklace and unfortunately won't be able to stand out."
The presentation in the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the presentation in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought tickets for the discomfort that caused them.
If you need more information, please contact the customer service at the cash office where you bought your tickets.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis named the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The Cardinals have the highest position in the Church’s spirituality immediately after the Pope, and are those who choose the Pope, so that Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as the cardinal reaches the age of 80, the pope’s elections can no longer be held – the group is reduced to 120 voting cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Federico Lombardi, spokesman of the Vatican, said that before the celebration of new cardinals, there will be a gathering of current cardinals known as the concierge.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to call the February conspiracy in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices newspaper said the number of voting cardinals would likely decrease until February.
He said the pope usually names as many cardinals as it is necessary to increase the number of voters again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The conspiracy will be significant next year, because it will be the first after Francesco was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At this time, some orientations are being made for Europe and especially for Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominees cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
Fourty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have an insignificant number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francesca founded the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was “perhaps possible” that the Pope would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s a total news.
Valero said the Pope traditionally raised the position of the bishop’s cardinals from large places, but Francis was “a full surprise – so we don’t know who he named.”
GM downloads some new lightweight trucks in the United States for repair of seats
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Car Safety Authority, General Motors has downloaded nearly 19,000 of its 2014 new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light truck vehicles to repair the failure of the manual landing machine.
In some of these vehicles, a mechanism for attaching the front seats may have a failure.
As a consequence, seats are not in line with the federal car safety standards for heads.
The State Transport Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that “if the back truck gets a hit, the headband does not need to properly protect the passengers, which increases the risk of an accident.”
The downloaded models were made between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the supply in June, and for this U.S. car, it is the most important vehicle marketing since restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owners of the failure in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcement to owners due to a 16-day government failure, which in October weakened the growth of car sales.
Silverado and Sierra’s sales, which were reprocessed for 2014 models, increased by about 20 percent over the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models.
The shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Obamo's voters' stunning screaming
I chose Obama twice – I shared hope for a possible change
He says Obama's honest efforts have defeated the obstruction of the Republican party
Obstructive policy cannot apologize for the passion of Obamo’s website of health care or attacks of airplanes without pilots
The 2008 Obama campaign’s memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard in the second year.
In these days I read a very sad book.
About this book, I thought, during the dark days of my second year, he would encourage me to attend the Faculty of Medicine and restore hope in me.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a reminder of the 2008 President Barack Obama campaign.
When I finish patient reviews and go to bed in the evening, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and expressions took your breath.
The elections ended with a sharp prevailing, and the TV reporting forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My students were crying with joy, and my parents hid the newspapers that they had.
A young team of visionaries went to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
In 2008, Obama had 82% support.
And here I'll close the book.
Going to the present is a strict awakening, like talking from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – it seems to be remote memories, sad memories of missed opportunities.
In the years after I introduced my first election ticket, there have actually been changes.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I admit that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes – from the available care law through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “not to ask anything, not to say anything” after the murder of Uzma bin Ladin.
In addition, I am convinced that party obstructions have turned so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, the public’s ability to choose health care and close the Guantánamo base.
But after many situations in which I defended Obama’s administration against colleagues and colleagues, I have reached an absolute limit when it comes to an explanation that they can provide.
I found myself in a political unhealthy place.
The obstruction of the Republicans cannot explain consent to listening to foreign leaders or to the landing of non-pilot aircraft that kill innocent children in the sea.
It cannot be explained that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor that it persecutes those who disclose the government’s wrong actions.
They cannot be held responsible for the murder of Anwara al-Awlak, an American citizen, without a proper court or limitation of public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
They can’t justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “more aggressive... than Nixon’s administration.”
And most recently, they cannot apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like that could be expected.
When I was 18, I had to realize that government power could be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded her.
The election function obviously does not have a predictable course and our public interviews will create an opposition political party and occasional events such as a Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above seem to be the result of the administration’s own decision.
And that's the most trouble for me.
I voted again to Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited to his candidate.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbroken alternative and seemed to be unable to strengthen his politics or position.
I felt that the second functioning period for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hope we’ve ever heard about.
However, the return to 2008 – with the support of Obama falling below 45% this week – is increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the number of promises that have lost.
This week, I read in the book chapter about how Obama suffered a sharp defeat with Clinton at the Pennsylvania primaries.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain loyal to his mission.
“I want our magic back,” he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.

Clive Palmer says President Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest due to parental vacation program
Billionaire and Mr Clive Palmer says the government’s President Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because his daughters can get pregnant and take advantage of it.
The Bani magnate, which leads a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax, issued this claim when trying to knock out of the table asking whether it is in conflict with interests.
Palmer’s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which plays a crucial role in deciding whether carb taxes and mining activities are to be collected.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that in a conflict of interests only ministers can be, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have personal benefit from that policy.
"He has reached a big conflict of interests in terms of a paid parental leave because if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting a parental leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the elections, Mr. Palmer officially declared a winner in the fight for the Fairfax District in the Sunshine Coast, thanks to 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to accelerate the process.
Tony's daughter Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the elections have been closed?
“We have to have a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can come, draw details into your computer, vote immediately and get results at half a night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of petitions to mark voting tickets.
Is it possible to get results if someone doesn’t like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of the juice seems incredible.
The Election Committee studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political program also applies to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new work "very seriously".
The public office is a public service.
“We do not strive for any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time,” he said.
You wash your hands?
Scientists have found that they wash their hands to God and to God.
The experiment took place 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two had to resolve an insolvent role.
Of course, they both failed.
But a group who washed his hands after a failure acted much more optimistic than the one where her participants did not waste his hands.
The group "with washing hands" also conducted better in the next test than the other.
Nevertheless, those who washed their hands found worse results in other tests than those who were not washed them.
The results of the "dead" were at the third level of the group, whose participants did not notice any previous failures.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that body purity actually eliminates negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivations fall, tests must be concentrated much more in further tests.
If we transfer the research results to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of the Czechs and the Czechs have hands, but it’s already five.
In hygiene, it usually hurts after working in the garden or in a workshop, when 85% of people wash their hands.
The warming of a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash hands after giving hands to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of the Czechs and 40.3% of the Slovaks will wash their hands.
The study showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be on the spot, I am afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to do so a little better," the results of a survey by skin doctor Claudie Komárková commented.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another sign that global investigations by control authorities regarding suspected currencies are increasingly common.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they work with the competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where they change owners of $5.3 billion each day.
The mention of the two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended within the scope of an expansive investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR rate manipulation scandal (London Interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that this month she received a request for information from the authorities.
“Our unexpected research on this matter continues and we are working fully with FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event reported that RBS transmitted financial behaviour records of emails and quick reports sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position of the European President of foreign currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Chairman for Cash Trading in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former currency trading leader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
No one of these traders was accused of any offence.
The group of Mr Usher for the sending of quick reports included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people said they were devoted to this event.
UBS said this week, after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that he investigated suspected machinations on the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, he took steps against some of his employees.
At least six offices worldwide – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss anti-monopoly office Weko, FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office – are investigating the claims that these bankers have joined to move with the currency market.
The reporters said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the relevant authorities.
Banks have been translated for years by old quick messages and emails to find cases of any offences.
Investigation reports scared traders in the area, which was one of the largest profit-making engines in investment banks closures in the past years, but which was disrupted by the low-continuity of exchanges limiting opportunities for speculatives.
Some bankers tried to reduce the severity of the situation when they argued that with a large and high liquid market with foreign currency it was essentially impossible to manipulate, but the high position of traders said that it must not necessarily be true.
A highly built trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trading with foreign currency exploring liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, “you can begin to influence the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day Credit Suisse announced that this week she left her stock trading department, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the competent authorities and shall cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved,” Credit Suisse said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague has exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have seen more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the monitoring in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, tests have confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is based on statistics from the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Institute of Health.
According to it, there have been 2,063 infected throughout the Czech Republic.
In 396 diseases, immune failure has already disappeared.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic is growing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later, 121 were already reported.
In 2009, the investigation revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 180.
The number of people declined to 153, but last year it was recorded.
According to the laboratory, there were 212.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, I think no doubt anymore," says an expert on the AIDS issue Miroslav Headaty, who for years led the Prague Lighthouse for patients.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed infection in 39 people and last year at 47, said Headaty.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
HIV tests have been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women from the beginning of the monitoring until the end of September.
AIDS has spread in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Whoever really wants to know a city should go to the cemeteries.
His visit reveals more than a walk in the center with monuments, castles and galleries, more than he would disclose the Bedecker.
Many people "read from the tombs."
The cemeteries are slowly entering and gaining an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what faiths, how large and cohesive families belong, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were for them.
In what way they express their social position, what taste they have.
And from the state of the tombs, he finds out how the dead are taken care of.
The Supreme Court supported Obama’s Healthcare Act
The U.S. Supreme Court decided that the law on health care signed by Barack Obama is in line with the constitution, which is a crucial victory for Obama’s administration.
With a ratio of 5:4, the court decided that the individual regulation on patient protection and available care – which orders citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 – would not oppose the Constitution on the basis of governmental tax powers.
The President of the Court John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the 2700-page law and further decided that the legal requirement for health care which orders States to extend the possibility of obtaining disease insurance, otherwise it threatens to remove all funding of federal health insurance from federal resources, is not incurred and in violation of the law.
26 States and the National Federation of Independent Companies have filed a complaint to block this Act.
During the 2012 primacy, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
After the word "Mugabe is a liar's donkey" no longer threatened prison, the court canceled the law
Until now, Zimbabweans had to pay good attention to the public speaking about Mugabem, the nineteenth century, who ruled the country since the early 1980s, and then since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Act, for the default of the Presidential Office, a penalty of $100 threatened to a year of withdrawal of freedom.
"State representatives should not blame people who comment on the president in the houses or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges agreed unanimously that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s decision, the British BBC said.
A number of Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, whose police arrested two years ago for the alleged president's offense in a bar-click.
In May, he ended in prison, an opposition activist who frequented Mugabe's public award of "bowl-ass".
In August, the prosecutor accused a sixty-six-year-old man of his intention to use a plaque with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The court also declared an anti-constitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The State cannot punish people whose declaration will later appear to be false," said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law allowed the person who would disclose false information to be sentenced to twenty years of prisoner.
"The existence of a law allowing someone to criminalize for false statements has a frozen effect on the right to freely express itself," Malala added.
Although Mugabe has ruled the country with a strong hand for over 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in March.
Small steps towards the dictatorship of one man in the country rose in 2009 when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition led to the Prime Minister’s chair Morgan Tsvangira.
However, the country is still suffering from the economic crisis and by 2008 the highest inflation in the world, exceeding 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely cancelled the national currency.
Nowadays, in Zimbabwe, only the currency of other countries is applicable.
The agriculture of Mugabe is under the influence of the unbalanced agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the soil of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
But most of them had no experience with the farm.
Central banks will keep swap lines permanently
Interim and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Feed, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks to access global currencies at any time they need.
The banks said this in their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economist of the London Bank Barclays.
"To date, all the transitional tools of this type have gradually become permanent, so I think that's no surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the move that started in 2007 when the international loan market for the first time crashed.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euro, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing for the end of its U.S. economy support programme, which could exacerbate the price of money on the global market even higher.
The Swap Contract is standardly used to overcome the lack of liquidity of a single currency while the current excess of liquidity of a second currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a lease of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore trust to European banks.
The EU has agreed to bank supervision, and the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I signed up on Tipsport.com.
I didn’t finish this because there was someone who couldn’t finish the internet registration on the side.
And since I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and that's why I changed my address and the civil certificate number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it wasn’t because I have a different OP number, address and just can’t complete it and that I should ask for deletion of data and make a new registration.
So I did this and on 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I request deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable Data Protection Act.
On that day, I wrote technical support that I had to complete the registration on my subsidiary.
This began the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where they finally wrote after the 4th of 25.10 that personal data were deleted on my request.
Therefore, a person would say that he could do that new registration, and there started problems again here first, it wrote to me that my username was already occupied (I understand it wasn't deleted - it wasn't personal data, but finally it was deleted).
So I used another username and jumped on me that my personal data have already been stored to complete registration on the branch (how can they have stored something that claims they have deleted?), so I again contacted technical support.
On my question, how it was possible, they told me that personal data were actually deleted on 25.10. and to send an email with that error.
I did this yesterday (about 15 p.m.) and I was dismissed today that I signed up on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13:22 and that's why I didn't, because I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been in contact with technical support for a week and I'm going to deal with them that it still doesn't work.
And what about the fact that if the truth is what they say (as it is not) no one should register with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, only at the 13.22 I actually registered on the same name and date of birth, but I used the thoughtful e-mail and phone number and the world wondered, I found the page that sent me a link to complete registration.
How is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds registration to email and phone number and data simply did not sorte as they claim.
So again I told technical support that they just lie (be intentionally or don't know what they write) because what they write isn't true.
I proved a few screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. so the "false" registration simply has no effect on this.
Tipsport gave me a stringent sentence - I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your claims.
And the communication ended.
Respectively repeats the same sentence that registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can’t even accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on that link in an email and thus it didn’t even happen.
So if I summarize it, Tipsport not only deletes the data as he claims, but still lies when he claims the opposite.
The worst thing is that it can be easily proven how they lie and try to make it look like the error is on the side of the customer.
By the way, after introducing this issue in my personal blog, things went a bit into movement, and from Technical Support email came that the issue is transmitted to verification and I will be informed (after a week of emergency and investigation and warning for the same error).
Music plays in the subway
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the project Music in the subway.
The first vestibule where instrumental music plays continuously during the operation of the metro is the Musk of the line A on the way out to the Václavsky Square.
The experimental operation lasts six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Texter Michal Horáček brought not only his entirely new double CD Czech calendar, but also in the series between the singers Lenku Novou, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matthew Benk.
After the introduction of the musician’s intrude and the actor’s eutude about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stadium, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how they played last time in Cologne and the theatre and the entire city of electricity.
"They made two kinds of cards in Cologne, with which I've been in contact with a lot," he said.
He also reminded the family of President Zeman.
"We might be able to make tours after Zakolans or Dubravce to Bratislava," he laughed at the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the shower and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new music break.
The calendar also made Joseph Mannes, who put him on the orlo, about ice hockey, but at that time he didn’t know how we were meeting on those places and scanning, who didn’t jump, isn’t Czech.
This is the name of one song from the Czech calendar, but we won’t play here today,” he said.
On the other hand, Ondra Ruml sang a very good sleep for him on the day, singing at night, and accompanied her on a guitar.
Otherwise, he played percussion, and all three singers followed the cap in the composition of the keyboard, violoncello, guitar and counterbass.
All three vocalists singed together a little bit of a retreat to the side of the heart, which immediately scattered the search.
“I’m glad that the song took you, which didn’t surprise me in the city of Kmoch,” said Michal Horáček.
After the remembrance of Petra Hapku, I know in the presentation of Francis Segrada, originally awarded by Richard Müller with a huge applause, Han Heger recalled the song Dad liked Lid Baar as well as Horák's explanation of the communist ban and replacement of Baar Westouer.
The founder Michael Kocába recalled the song Sebastián, Segrado then singed the beautiful song of Prague singed by the Garden of Liberty, the adornment and the former Kolínian.
But this was already the conclusion, the pottery in the standing and the addition in the form of optimistic songs We live in a wonderful time.
There was another add-on on the playlist, but the fans didn’t get out of it anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four were sitting at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček, his books and even the pack from the legendary LP and with potential stakeholders.
Berdycha and Stephanos will complement Rosol and Hajek
In the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis player Jaroslav Navratil four of Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but are going to play the competitor's playground in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs have been third in the last five years in the final.
"We know we're going to a hot soil that it's going to be wild and we have to focus as always on our performances."
"We're going there with the only goal - get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, a winner of the score in the last final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Obama’s training to bomb Syria.
American team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have precisely explained how the Syrian bombing is going to look.
Without unnecessary humbage, threats, and millions of statements, they sent the planes, they hit the target and returned.
Without allowing them to be used by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire action and are no longer expressed.
The exact opposite of confusion and great deeds of the Syrian politics of Obama.
And the most satisfying of the whole attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don’t be confused by the media’s claims that the Syrian base was bombed or “supply to Hezbollah”.
I recently wrote here that while the U.S. assistance to secular rebels in the country remains only at the rhetoric level, Russia is happy to continue delivering weapons in Syria.
And the fresh supply of Russian missiles laid out in the port of Latakia has become a part of the Israeli navigation.
It's a clear message.
And note, Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebellion, although, according to popular Internet theories, it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has appointed two members of space units, probably Delta force.
It has not yet been known that they were nominated during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs members who had attacked the CIA area in the city is known, I think it was the CIA's secret team, which was made up of former soldiers.
For a long time it speculated what SEALs were doing at the consular or even elsewhere in the CIA.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has in Libya its offices protected by hot hotspots (right on one of these two SEAL members have died after an intervention), is relatively surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about these two unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. team in Tripolis, and as soon as they received a report on the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to sign up for an intervention and along with five private contractors went on their way to the CIA area in Benghazi.
Obama’s administration blasphemes the fact that during the attack, the command was not officially settled and entirely, and that it was just worth what to do.
Commander, without orders, obviously will release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that it is not a single, but permanent U.S. team, CIA agents and private contractors in the country is quite interesting.
This is because so far nothing has been officially recognized and it is only about some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
However, it is good that the United States is attempting to overthrow terrorism in Libya.
Although it would be much more important to resolve the global situation.
The last place of a secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It wasn’t so long that the media almost deceived the Iranian air forces for the strike of U.S. drones.
However, few are known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if they accidentally manage to discover their drone in the airspace, they can’t do anything to do with it.
However, if the Iranian drones are discovered in an international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom drone pursued the American drone in an international space above the sea, when it was possible the first striking launch of the American super-trapper F-22 Raptor in history.
He underwent Phantom to optically verify his arms without recording him on the radar or simply noting him, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and invited an Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without reply.
It is not surprising when Phantom is an American aircraft of production, but it remembers the war in Vietnam.
It can't be compared to Raptore.
We want to show that Plzen is still able to win, Rajtoral promises
It's a little paradox.
While his team is mostly not successful in recent years, defence or backup Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has the form that brought him back to the representation after a year.
He is also able to shoot him, shoot him with an activity, after the intervention of him was arranged a punishment headquarters in the Teplics race.
Viktoria sat in the last two wheels against Slavia and in Teplics after the victory, but finally took one point from these two duels.
Francis Rajtoral believes his team will break the unpleasant series in the race with Jablon.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that the Apple will be defeated at home," said Francis Rajtoral.
The man is preparing for a hard match, the Northeast who plays attacking football is carefully prepared.
Everything is aimed at playing with Jablonc, the coach prepares us well, as always we pump a lot out of the video game of the competitor.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," said the Czech fans at the Doosan Arena Tribes.
The last matches did not go as they wished, but the word of the defence crisis denied Viktoria.
So it goes in football, sometimes you have a good shape and sometimes you get worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I think we'll win on Friday and it'll be good again," the defender said.
Victory will rely on the support of fans.
"It's played on Friday night and so I would like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will be grateful to them for the victory," Rajtoral adds.
Jan Pete: Step back.
So I decided to make a step back, but when I think so, it's not actually a step back, but a big jump - a jump back a few years ago, in memory, in my childhood.
It is a reminder of what it was, not having any concerns and just come from school and wash the dishes, relax and do tasks.
Although these “obligations,” it was usually just the theory, the parent’s desire.
Practice was completely different - getting out of school, throwing the bag into the wheel and running out.
Play with the other kids ball games, jumping a panic.
Then at the series, Helena and her boys put out a chain of celebration for grandmother's birthday.
And then after a few years of warning to wash the container finally, explode, put wood in the hillstones in the winter and do the tasks until after seed under the lamp (or rely on the co-worker and instead of the tasks to write a loving verse addressed to school love).
In the morning, you will have breakfast in the house (from the real fruit, not the jackets that are now being sold, whose content next to the jackets did not lie) and you will have a tea from the dried herbs that I and my mother so enjoyed collecting.
I also remember those magical evenings when the graveyard was quiet in the room when we recorded songs from the radio to the cassettes that sounded loudly in the old cassette after my mother.
And then we threw the cassettes on the rug, and still threw around the same song, our favourite, and joined it with a siphony.
Or we were calling through the table by using the stickers that were tied to each other by the sample - and when we were already at the phone call to hear one another better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the shelter was a sire + watt.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live from it so that we missed nothing.
We didn’t need any iPhones, iPads, or mobiles, or laptops, or brand clothing.
Clothing has been inherited from generation to generation, and the best "appropriation" into the dressing room was a batiked shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
From electronics, we were satisfied with the said mother’s caset, and at the maximum Walkman, which we shared with her sister and which we used just on the train on the school trip.
It's more interesting to play with aunt Hop or Man, don't worry, or as I've already mentioned to go out "only".
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, surely my parents saved him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn’t warm up for a long time with us.
My younger sister sneered into him a groove, he said that he was so beautifully packed the cassettes, so she tried to see if the groove was asleep.
Unfortunately, he slept, but that was his last deal.
Well, and this incident, poor man, has been on the table from Dad.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she wrapped in the video and thought she was playing her recipe and didn't play, so she couldn't escape it so far.
I remember how we all were able to communicate together, to deal without a mobile, computer.
Together, my sister and I met with grandmother's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's's grandfather's grandfather's.
We've come together.
Promise someone to see you in a year!
I also remember the winter when we ran out with the whole village, built snowballs, ride on a snowy bath at the church on the pillows of the age.
Then we and the whole family went together and talked about the last day.
Of course, we heard the sister before each dinner with a notoriety-known phrase, "When you wash your hands."
Yes, that's true today, but you surely don't have a lemon net in the bathroom.
After dinner, when my father was "working" in the garage with Jardu from the village, my mother and I went to the floor, smoked the feet of a cake stone, opened the door and climbed on the flames and listened to the scream of wood that came from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count on how many friends we have on social networks, we knew how many friends we have, those real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through various chats, SMS.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And so I could continue for a long time.
It’s nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the album, where they’re clearly wrapped in black corners triggered by black and white images.
And if I wouldn't have known how much I was then, the back of the picture is always written a year to take a picture.
I see that although our sisters weren’t much listening to us, and, in addition, we had a cousin’s pants by two numbers bigger, no one laughed before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step ahead - into reality.
By 2013, I’ll wait for what the modern era will think of once for my children.
What I certainly know is that these memories are now at least for a young teenager, so somewhere "100 years behind a cigar" and I think a lot of them are coming to see that this "prejudice" isn't going to experience the time too.
I would like them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are accused of Nortel’s patents
The company, which owns thousands of missing patents to Nortel, filed a complaint on Thursday for breach of a patent against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, a company that was awarded to the auction under Nortel’s bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, appealed to Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for breach of the patent at the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breach of seven patents.
The patents include technology that helps connect the terms searched on the Internet with the relevant advertising, claims, which is the core of Google’s search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar weren’t right away.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that work on Google Android’s operating system, which is strongly competing for mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million default offer for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and has finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for the Nortel patents, Google earned 1.2.5 billion dollars by Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by a Motorola patent group.
"In spite of the failure in the auction of patents that are subject to dispute, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," the complaint said.
Rockstar seeks to increase the damage compensation from Google because it is said to have a patent infringement by Google intentionally, as the complaint claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came out of 4 degrees Celsius, which we haven't used to yet.
First, she delayed the smile, the one that still puts it to the shadow as a defense against a friendly environment.
This made her a lot of relief because it was a mask that she decided not to put in public.
He was honest at home only in the days when her grandmother had her grandmother and had her grandchildren Elinku or Adika around her.
And of course, when her sons were calling her.
She remembered a lesson from the infinite business skills courses.
Finally, they're really going to do it.
Don't shame your closest.
Then he flew to the wheel.
It's like a dress on a mascara.
November, nor any other month can make that miracle to really smile as when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been there for almost three years.
Egypt puts the first freely elected president in office
Muhammad Mursí made an inauguration oath, but his triumphant day is only difficult to end political concerns in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised “New Egypt” when he was celebrated to be introduced to the office as the first freely elected president of the country, after Husni Mubarak, who was settled for 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursí became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth head of Egypt since the eradication of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore to 18 judges dressed in black talars in a seat built with views of the Nile, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better tomorrow, the new Egypt and the second republic," Mursí said at a party broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today set the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursí, a sixty-year-old engineer graduated in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which has been mostly since its 84 years of creation as an illegal organization in the way of striking attacks by individual governments.
When Mursí arrived in small colonies of cars shortly after 11 p.m., hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the building court to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidential proof, the transportation period was only shortly stopped so that the column could project normally by a disruptive path linking the city centre with the suburbs to the south.
The personal prestige of Mursí, laughterly referred to as the "reserve tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has steadily increased from his victory and his Friday speech, which aims to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also all those who want to bring to an end the opposition against the authoritarian.
“Egypt is a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state today,” Mursí, dressed in a blue social clothing with a red cravate to judges in a wooden chamber where he swore.
Mursí later traveled to Cairo University, where he had an inaugural speech.
While watching, he received an official welcome from the military team that played a national hymn.
There was a military commander of the field march Hussain Tantávi.
His arrival was accompanied by a scan of “army and people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Mursí swore on Friday a symbolic oath to Tahir Square, in a place where the revolution was born, which ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak last year, and celebrately promised again to capture the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them from the exile leader.
But by agreeing with the composition of the official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, as it is usual, he was subjected to the will of the army, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech on the Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
In the ghettos, police specialists will have to relieve tensions.
In the Geths in the Czech Republic, police specialists should be involved in the future.
They would spend only half of their work here.
They're watching and solving the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between poor people and surroundings.
In its proposal to reduce safety risks, the Ministry of Interior counts this.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would mainly help “speak social housing”.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor homes and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people, especially the Romans.
Adults in ghets were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children finished in "special" schools.
It's white.
According to experts, there were hundreds of problems.
Relations between their residents and others are strengthened.
There were anti-Romans in several places.
There were also people around the world joining extremists.
According to the interior, it is demanding for the police in areas with ghetto security and order to be maintained.
The basic condition is "consequent application of equal access in the exercise of the law".
But it says that without the detailed knowledge of the place and people cannot be achieved.
The specialist would go to the cemetery in a ghetto where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a problem location, he would be watching the order.
He would also know locally so that he could better solve problems or crimes.
“Thanks to trust, specialists will be able to prevent a number of illegal acts more easily,” he said.
Gheth specialists would receive additional charges, from 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers in the problem areas should be based on Norwegian funds.
The budget is about €600,000 (now about €15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, funds 85 percent.
The preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project will last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded locations is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roman settlements here," reporters said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special policeman would need.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the project has been completed.
According to the project proposal, first elected police officers have a stage in Slovakia.
This training should be carried out by five dozens of members each year.
The most suitable candidates will be taken from them.
There should also be special training for police officers who will act in ghets.
According to the authors, the social housing would be mainly helpful to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea of the interior, it should have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard should have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
Renters should comply with an integrated plan that would be composed by social workers with them.
They must comply with accommodation order, take care of their health, send children to school, requalifie and actively search for work.
If they were attempting to integrate, they would be put into a higher standard of residence.
The housing system should function for at least 30 years, according to the internal system, until the next generation grows "in an interintegrally motivated environment".
The social housing model prepares resorts for local development and work.
They have to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Carbon top - one of our youngest soaps.
The carb top is an upstairs hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Together with several others, the evidence of special activity in Lower Autumn is recently (from the geological point of view).
The last eruptions were here at the beginning of the fourth.
At the top of the Uhlířské top, there is an apparent white-minded baroque passing church of Virgin Marie Helper, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden chapel.
The host who stood next to the church did not keep it.
Shortly after the church was completed, it was planted from four lines of lips, a length of about 1 km.
The crossroads on the Uhlírska top is already the third version, the original was here after 1916, the second, from 2001, lasted only until 2004.
On the fifteen stops there are wooden plastics constructed by local artistic drawer František Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the Low Spring area.
Similarly, the upper branches of the area form an interesting geological exhibition.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated at each stop.
The carbon top is the remainder of the young soup.
Although data from radiometric measurements are slightly different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than the Great Red (aged 3.3 million) and older than the Venusina soup (aged 0.8 million).
The soup was born with an explosion.
With it, she threw a large amount of sleeping poultry along with the clutches of the upper floors that were made in red-brown color by burning it.
At the end of this stage, the surface of the lave - today, it is a layer of a porous bracelet up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw red, brown and places to black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters strong and its part is accessible in the wall of the loft.
In the tufes, the apparent sofa booms are up to 1 meters. Even the second eruption has been completed by the leaf lift.
At the end of the activity, a lave came out of the soup, which today constitutes up to 50 m of a strong layer of a stringed head.
Socks that replace the deformation of the soup soup with the folds of the soup are the most common type of soup.
Because they are actually made up of layers, they received the name of the stratovulkan.
The original soup dog was gradually eroded.
However, he was threatened by the mining of horns in a loft on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place between 1953 and 1962.
Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The exercise was successful under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and thus maintain this unique place.
However, the problem is in the polarity and small consistency of horns, which quickly wind, break down, and climb downwards.
Lom is going out quite quickly.
In order to make the situation even more complicated, it is warm, south-oriented every ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The repair is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
There is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
On the Uhlířský top you get the green tourist mark from Bruntal, if possible from Slezský Kočov.
Automotive drivers can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the leap, where a short learning path also begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of his life in a chinese villa with a garden and a pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa neighborhoods on Orzechovce.
However, the original owners of the house received it back in refund, and the renters had to move with a small departure.
So Ivana quickly searched for a replacement home for herself and her older mom at that time.
From the well-known, she received a tip to apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"Initially it was a shock, but a look from the fourth floor to the vast forest park and the curve inspired me on the other side," Ivana recalls on the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a provision for three years.
"We live here for more than thirteen years today, and not only because of gradual reconstruction I would not change," the owner added.
The mother and her daughter moved from an apartment of thirty-three meters to a smaller area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment ranged.
The action was not simple, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in a totally good condition, but they had to make necessary adjustments, such as lacking the doors or switching the windows.
The predecessor of the owner broke out the core, but the owner exercised most unprecedentedly and unnecessaryly large front, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
By connecting two rooms, a multifunctional living room was created.
The architects used to define the individual zones and split the room of a cardboard, which allowed the new location of lights.
The first intervention she committed after a few years was the removal of the cloth in the living room.
This way the apartment changed its disposal to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenhouse.
Another step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC flooring for laminate.
I don't know about the bathroom.
For years, I took home magazines and sought inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So, on the recommendation, I called the young architect Kamil Doudar.
“It was actually the most important step in the future,” Ivana said.
Thanks to the rebuilding of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the front door available.
The architect combined the space of toilets and bathrooms, and two doors with open wings replaced with one slide, saving space.
The bathroom is overtime and also sufficiently barrier-free.
Quality deposits imitate a sandy, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, with a bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doudar continued.
Within the series How a dream was built, a rapid, but substantial transformation of the living room, to which also took part the architect Martin Čenek.
In the space created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleep without helping with the classical principles of optical division, for example, semi-shaped or Japanese walls.
"This would infringe the openness and unity of space," the architect explains.
It was originally possible to separate the bedroom and the living room.
It was enough to turn the back of two sofas and place between them a safely made cabinet on the sofa.
The dining corner defines the shades of the floor and painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining corner, the architect used a quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived the wallpaper with the pattern.
The kitchenette covers movable panels with wallpaper, if necessary.
The new floor of anti-allergic marmole has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate: soft, smooth surface without sleep and better sound insulation.
The frames and views system from a colored cardboard is an illustration of how to work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted it to be happy.
“I love orange, the same shade I had in the previous apartment,” says Ivana.
The graphist object with the theme of flower magnolia is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To a warm energetic tone, architects chosen white, emphasizing modern functional style.
In the small apartment, books were stored, among other things, in the space under the window parapet.
Everything is at reach, the lamps are conveniently controlled on a distance.
In the refined interior, the contrast of the new with the elderly works greatly, for example, with decades of old crystal mirrors and with quality artistic objects that Ivana collects throughout his life.
The last one came to the kitchen.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides, and the owner seemed to be there a little like a tunnel.
The architect picked up their number and transferred their location.
Furniture in simple design is made on custom, the white surface lightly shades the pearl surface.
Thanks to the ideal solution for washing machine, dryer and washing machine, the small space was entered.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the entire glass walls above the workplace.
The unique graphics glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is greatly maintained.
Ivana chose flowers of magnolia that resemble her the favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be satisfied here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and washing machine, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cover.
The large shower corner has glass doors Ronal.
The task was to create a clear simple space from a given environment in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
The interior we unified materially and colorfully and tried for its elegant, cozy, not too overfilled appearance.
“A further condition of the application was the barrier-free solution with minimal barriers and possibilities of easy movement around furniture and the availability of items of daily needs,” adds Kamila Douderová.
The Supreme Court decided, “No time can be slaughtered.
The Supreme Court decided that the former Prime Minister of Necessity could be prosecuted even for any crimes that could be made before the dismissal of the House of Ambassadors in August.
It was protected only by the processional immunity, which relates to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark Snajdra and Petra Tluchore, on the contrary, decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offences until they resigned in November the execution of the MP's mandate, said Peter Knötig, spokesman of the Supreme Court.
With this decision, the court rejected the proposal of State Prosecutor Iva Ishkana, who wanted to continue criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a fee in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and will not make any problems with the adoption of laws.
In contrast, the former Prime Minister who offered these posts can also be found.
Vite Bartha and the anti-corruption police officer were also arrested.
Bart’s defender Oldrich Poverty, who also represented him in the case of the alleged corruption of the VV Members, also did not want to express himself too much, but said: “Yes, I am also representing the client in this matter, but I can’t comment on the protection of the hidden facts.”
According to information, the case is addressed by the General Security Inspection Assembly (GIBS).
Server tn.cz said Barta could buy secret information from the police.
According to the server of prvnizpravy.cz, the case could be associated with the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment to Bart was allegedly attempted.
The Laws indicate that the detention of Welcome Bárty is not related to Peter Lessy.
Police President Eva Kropač refused to comment on the case involving Prague City Representation.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of hidden facts," said the spokesman of the Law of the City State Representation in Prague, Stephank Zenklov.
That is where the Prosecutor Bart’s case is supervised, and therefore, from her words indirectly, it shows that the record or criminal proceedings are conducted in a secrecy mode.
Reporter Novinek managed to catch his wife Victor Barty Katerina Klasn in the morning before their residence in Prague Klarov.
She just put her bags in the car and left.
He refused to express the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bart’s arrest was expressed by the leader of the movement Úsvit Tomio Okamura.
He does not know, according to his words, what he is talking about.
“With Bártha was one of the many candidates to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Union of Direct Democracy, Tomia Okamura,” he added.
Victor Bárta, who failed to candidate for the movement of direct democracy, Tomia Okamura, in recent early elections to the House of Commons, is known for his corrupt case of paying the members of the Public Things.
In April 2012 he was unlawfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay to 30 months.
The sentence was subsequently changed and Bárta was released from the charges.
Sleep: I want a contract in the NHL.
I'm still in love, love, and enthusiasm.
The family has always been in the first place for Prospala, so she wants to be fully subjected to her at the age of 38.
He will either get a job in the sea and continue to extend his career, or he will definitely end with hockey.
"I want to play the role of my father and husband."
“I’m looking forward to it,” says a hockey player who is still looking forward to the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a declared worker who will never hurt anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice, he is able to squeeze his co-player.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he stated devotedly.
It may be pointed out, he is allegedly about the New York Rangers who have failed to enter the season and have two injured oppositions - Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
What's your arrival in Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, it's not worth dealing with it.
I know the article in the New York Post was released that they should sign me, but that's all.
There has never been added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not so.
Didn't they call you from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place every day.
That’s where the deal really comes.
When a player or someone is injured, it doesn't go away and manchaft doesn't go away.
There are many different factors that have to meet together to get that contract.
But in New York there are similar circumstances, aren't they?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan were injured, and the team didn't enter the season, so there's a certain chance, don't you think?
Of course, that chance is always.
The second thing is that you always need two sides to do it.
I would have taken a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
This is the reality in which I have to live.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something could just happen?
I have been expecting from July 5, when the NHL opened the market with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampy for kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and see you again.
Do you plan your program somehow?
It's the fact that I'm a father and a husband, and everything goes away from that.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of my father and husband and I'm looking forward to it.
Your grandfather has two hockey matches already on Sunday, that is for me and my whole family a holiday when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time imports?
Of course, a person can think of a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches for the knee surgery.
And so much and so much was fun.
Once it comes into such a phase that all goals, wins and games don’t replace you with what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever you have a job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could have met besides my family.
You have had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it’s NHL, or is it because the family wants to be in America?
Because I am a hockey player, the first place, besides the family, is sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And from that, family life also depends.
My children, forgiveness, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the states, began to go to school there, and so on.
And we would love to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to say is that in America the possibilities are completely elsewhere.
We should offer them such a chance.
Are you planning to stay in America for a long time?
We're going to practice it as far as now.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic on the Deep and in the vicinity of Czech Budějovic.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfect to be in warmth.
I had a huge happiness in my life.
It can be said that I went back to him, it cost a lot of strength and denial, and it took me a lot of things I missed.
But hockey has offered me a lot of options for pay, and this is one of them.
We can choose where to live with our wife.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will of you at your age to treasure, train hard, and wait for the offer?
Yes, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to the people that you still have in the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it will stay there.
You can't plan it.
So you can say you're waiting for this season to get rid of it and then decide what next?
I'm in the stage when I go from day to day.
The Chief Executive Officer recently announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4rd Temelín power plant will be delayed by the end of 2014 or 2015.
It justified it by awaiting the new State Energy Concept and by endorsing Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current leadership of the Czech Republic is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, as a majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give shareholders recommendations and not hide behind them.
I'm just with the government on Saturday.
Andrei Babiš begins to calm down that his AND movement will not have time to learn political action in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create any of them at all.
Yes, the President approves this in an interview for the Law that will come out tomorrow.
Shopping and marketing of ŠkoFIN is led by Abraham
Its competences include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He was replaced by Ludwig’s tent.
Abraham has connected his career for the last 14 years with the automotive sector.
He served at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat Czech company, where he was responsible for seven years for the brand and Alfa Romeo dealers.
His last office was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of the automotive division manager for five years.
Skofin was founded in 1992.
Police evacuated a part of Los Angeles airport for shooting
At Los Angeles International Airport, they were shot in the morning.
Police evacuated a part of the airport, allegedly a third terminal.
The Reuters agency, with a call for California media, claims that the lawmen shot a gun of an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times with a police link said there was a shooting in which two to three passengers were injured.
How many people have been injured and whether there are victims, but it is still unclear.
Hasiči talks about events with more injured people.
CNN: Israel bombed the Syrian military base.
The aim was to be Russian rockets for Hizbollah.
Israeli military aircraft on Thursday have bombed the military base near the Syrian port of Latakia.
With a call to the U.S. government's most nominated agent, CNN announced it.
The Israeli press has widely reported the explosion in the alleged warehouse, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack on it.
The Israeli army spokeswoman refused to comment on the airplane.
"We are not talking about foreign media reports," she said.
According to the U.S. government source, the Israeli missiles and related equipment could be transported to the militant Lebanese movement of Hezbollah.
The AP agency, with a reference to another U.S. security agent, informed that the Israeli target aircraft was the Russian missile SA-125 on the Syrian territory.
The second Israeli television channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian anti-air defence system.
According to DPA, satellite images of the attack area showed the Russian S-125 Neva missile batteries.
In addition, the SA-3 missile batteries were seen on them, including the commanding center with a radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to Israeli television reports, recorded missiles have reached 35 kilometers and could carry 70 kilograms of heads.
Israel has already bombed missiles at least twice this year, CNN and AP said.
The Israeli army never reacted to such reports, but repeatedly said it would strike any shipping of weapons intended for Hizbollah or other groups marked as terrorists.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successful with this trend.
The company has updated the estimate of annual profits and expects record profits from recreators in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit prior to taxation to be between $325 and $340 million compared to $305 to $315 million from previous forecasts.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase in the record profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said Flight Centre had created eight percent profits in the first and second half of the year and began a strong growth in Australian and British travel outside the business.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are targeting record annual profits before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profitmakers.
Recreational businesses in Australia grew up during the second half, which compensates a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre was well conducted in the recreational area, while business customers spent less.
After the loss of the U.S. trade has recovered during a seasonal weaker semester, and it is expected to bring the third in a series of annual profits.
Flight Centre’s shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transferred to Petrohrad
Environmental activists have been detained in Russia since September because of the protest against the planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
Today, she informed the AFP with an appeal to the International Greenpeace Environmental Organization.
She also claims that the original charges of her piracy activists have not yet been downloaded.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women, detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil plate in the Arctic, were transported from Murmansk's repair facility to the prison in Petrohrad," the company said in a statement.
The reasons for the displacement of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned displacement.
Ecology officials first accused them of piracy, which threatened them to have been sentenced to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, they announced that the accusation would replace it with a milder extortion, which threatens a lower penalty with the upper limit of seven years of withdrawal of freedom.
Greenpeace, however, noted in the statement today that the authorities' piracy charges have not yet reached what they promised.
This means that arrests are now charged with two crimes.
The Force Committee for Investigation announced last week that piracy charges would replace the charges of extortion.
But when thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not taken.
Instead, a new accusation was raised against everyone," the AFP said in a Greenpeace statement.
Russians arrested three tens of Greenpeace members from 18 countries in mid-September at Gazprom’s oil plate.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, which floated under the Dutch flag.
From that time on, everyone has been arrested against whom the appeal has been filed, but the court has rejected them all.
Ecologists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of the Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, said the move to Petrohrad would facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmanska.
"In fact, they can be worse," he said.
The Dutch King Willem-Alexandra, one of the detained activists Faiz Oulahsen, asked for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch invited the monarch to talk about their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He argues that Malaysia has a large share of the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is part of the struggles in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, orthographs and grammar
In English literature, at least one Shakespeare game, a novel from the 19th century, a romantic poetry and the present British literature will be studied since 1914.
The test will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language master's degree exam, and will be invited to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new degrees for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to be radically changed.
Other important items are expected to change next year.
In a separate step, the Office Ofqual, which supervises graduate exams, reveals changes in the structure of graduate exams, along with a new branding system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that he has “a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our test system to regain society’s confidence,” and that it is necessary to make the master’s exam “more demanding, more ambitious and more strict.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time in mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
To compare schools in Australia, mathematicians spend an average of 143 hours a year and about 138 hours in Singapore.
Although no official requirement to spend more time in mathematics, coalition sources have stated that the extensive master’s degree exam in mathematics – along with greater emphasis on this subject in the results numbers – will likely encourage schools to provide further teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “the real world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrav Prime Minister Kajnar: Cancer in the Czech Republic is not me
Before the elections, a long-suffering dispute between the two wings fighting for the influence within the SSSR.
It was all overwhelming when Prime Minister of Ostrava, Peter Kajnar, appealed to the court for the non-democratic composition of candidates.
However, the Caucasus actors didn’t want to express themselves too much so that the party wouldn’t hurt any more before the elections.
But now the voters are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava Czechoslovakia prompted Prime Minister Ostrava to leave the party on Monday evening, and he would also be pressing on his role.
Peter Kajnar wants to continue fighting.
What's in disputes and who's on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Daily.
How do you see the results of the elections?
The SSD has certainly had a much better outcome.
Was it harmful to us to deal with disputes in the media before the election?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better result of elections.
But, on the other hand, this is the condition in which the Czech Republic is now.
It's a party that has its internal problems, is internally sick and people feel it's not all right.
It was clearly revealed in the elections.
What are the Internal Diseases of SSSD?
I think it has been through the ODS for a while and similar things are now, unfortunately, happening in social democracy.
This is because lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their wings at the ODS moved to people in the Czech Republic and had an impact on them.
It then relates to the fact that the police are walking through the offices of the Ostrava magistrate and collecting computers.
This shows that the CSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their good.
The Czechoslovakia is divided into two unreliable camps even in Prague, as is seen in the current struggle for power between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
But it has been preparing for a long time.
What was happening before the elections in Ostrava was just the announcement of what is happening now in Prague.
Hash's wing gradually held positions so that after the elections it could cause the situation that weakened Sobot's wing.
People are in politics in a situation where they sometimes have to make compromises.
But everybody has some internal boundaries when these compromises can't do any more, and that's my case.
Originally, I did not want to apply to the House, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubosh Zaoral to try to reach the country candidate to strengthen Sobotko's wing as Prime Minister of Ostrava.
But his wing gave him a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotky, not Michael Haška?
I think Sobotka is a person who is always talking about the SSD program and to some extent also the visions for the side and for this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I haven't heard anything like that.
Michal Haschek is fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power, regardless of everything and against the apartments of the party.
According to me, what Michal Hashek presents in Prague now, he ended his political career.
How did you feel that the Czechoslovakia leader did not approve you for the candidate?
Political parties are based on the competition which is the same as their members.
This competition should be based mostly on program visions and the ability of those people to fulfill these visions.
Of course, however, people who don’t have a lot of abilities or vision are reported in this competition, but the political party is an elevator to money that they won’t get elsewhere.
The problem is that when these people begin to get to the forefront because they violate the rules without any concern, they violate the provisions of the parties.
They do their practices from the political parties of the Mafia and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Aware of this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether any Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect their opinions.
Therefore, did you submit before the election a preliminary action against the form of the Czech Republic candidate in the Moravskoslezka country?
The current district executive committee of the Czech Republic in Ostrava confirms its power by the fact that organizations that do not comply with it are able to cancel, with a view to establishing a new organization, gradually exterminate uncomfortable members of the party.
For example, it is also necessary that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a complaint against it and they would prefer to cancel his decisions.
This indicates that admonition of the party’s positions through courts is the last option, but at the moment that the other methods and controls within the CSD have ceased to work, it is the only option.
The attempt to lead the island Czechoslovakia in front of Mr. Adam Rykalou is to withdraw you from the position of the prime minister.
It's a public secret that this post has the secret of the mayor of Poruby Lumír Palyza.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me back.
They promise to people positions, get voices and then strengthen their powers on the side.
When I return to the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of Bazaly Stadium was just a goal for them to attack me.
It was artificially incarnated so that they could mark me as a person who gives money to where he does not belong.
The city bought a property that had strategically high value for him.
How do you see this as a prime minister?
The periodic committee already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our residence in the Czech Republic.
But I think it's like when a thief shouts, "Take a thief!"
When we look at the results of my work in the last eleven years, I don’t see anyone in the island’s Social Democracy who would initiate and prosaid, sometimes against members of the party, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
Nevertheless, everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it otherwise than preventing others from penetrating into the places they want.
Are you going to fight these attempts anyway?
Because if the Republic has to work well, then the political parties have to work well.
It is hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state when it is not able to manage itself.
So I don't think I'm going to leave the Czech Republic now, because I think that the one causing this side cancer is not me, but those people who are trying to excite me.
Olomouc opens in the historic center of public laundry
The organizer of the Holocaust Christmas markets and winter brushing Pavel Palený said that preparations on the cottage were started on 26 October and since Wednesday, it has been in operation for ice production agregate.
The ice layer is already strong seven centimeters and the surface will be prepared for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The square has a area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
There will also be two stains with a punch.
"We expanded the floor area, expanded the space in front of the staircase, and almost the entire area of the dish is covered so that the brushes can easily reset themselves," he said.
Olomouce streets are like Christmas coming.
Last year, due to the repair of the Lower Square, the cabin was installed right before the main entrance of the municipality on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the tendency of the summer, so the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people were able to crash right in front of the council in 2009, when the club was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will be launched a month before the first day on the Upper Square.

Brutal killing of senior in Zlinsk will again be resolved by the country court
The national court has released charges of a fifteen-year-old Slovak and a twenty-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the guilt.
They are at risk of 15-20 years of jail or even exceptional punishment.
Speaker Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court canceled the country’s decision and returned the case to the negotiation again.
The reasons that led to the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision has not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the accusations of the young men, a seventy-seven-year-old man died in his house.
Senior died of a tragic death.
According to the accusations, the men cut her, beat her, and bathe her throughout the body, and also with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds in her head.
A man suffered severe injuries, such as breaches of lebeca bones, swelling of the brain or bleeding in the brain that he had injured at the site.
Youths are supposed to take about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14 thousand crowns from the house.
According to the court, they were the only, in addition, indirect evidence against the accused perfume tracks, which the expert assessed as not fully found within the meaning of the legal instructions.
In more than ten cases, perfume tracks from the place of the offense also coincided with the accused, but the police initially imposed them as perfume tracks and not as perfume tracks.
There were also some doubts in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the blame of the accused was not proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A deceased senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
The victim was not noticed by a rescue service doctor.
A few days later, the criminals contacted the doctors who found the signs of violent death in the pit.
The police were no longer able to work with all the traces of the place of crime that their relatives had cleaned.
There was no DNA accused on the spot.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskograd.
He is now denied the punishment of 8.5 years, which he was confirmed by the Holocaust Supreme Court last year.
He said he was the head of a group of six youths whose conscience has a robbery of goldenity.
The robbery occurred in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopnem.
Younger accused of the murder of a senior lives in the Hungarian Hradish.
The court released him from prison in August after 11 months.
Znomo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was occupied by the builders who would rebuild the grass.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Live legend Wayne Shorter will close the next week of Struny in autumn
The Saxophonic giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make a point next Wednesday for the 18th anniversary of the Struny Festival in autumn.
Shorter will be released on November 6, in the Lucerny Grand Hall with its quartet composed by Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter joins the spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumzaka.
In Shorter's editing for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus sings from the novel album Without A Net, as well as its older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his eighty anniversary in August this year, Shorter is still full of power, showing that the Prague concert on the Strunách in the autumn starts his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The number of interpreters he worked with are from Milese Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santan.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitoush and Vienna's cousin Joem Zawinull, who gave the direction of a new style of fusion in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
In the last 13 years, he has played with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Jakousi afterparty after the festival will still be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9, at Roxy/NoD.
In addition to charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the manchester trio Go Penguin with its jazz influenced electronics and young jazz talent, Ian Mikyska, will bring the electro jazz format into Profound Bass inspired dance styles.
Ladies say UEFA is prohibiting punishment for the arbitrator.
Dagmar Damk, Chairman of the Committee of Arbitration of the Czech Football Association, ceased to publish penalties to the courts.
It is prohibited by the UEFA rules, which was laid down in the interview for the Law Journal.
Otherwise, he said he would threaten posts.
Damková also refused to play in her role footballers Plzná from where he came from.
These speculations are really meaningless.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but other members of the committee have been dismissed, for example, from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1:6," said Damkov in response to criticism, which collapsed after Plzen recently played twice as much penalty as the rest of the league teams.
Although FAČR has stopped publishing punishments for the arbitrator in recent months, Damková assures that the court is punished for his mistakes.
"Believe me that if the Commission finds that the arbitrator has committed an error, it limits the delegation to be in any competition," Damkov said.
The reason why the penalties are not disclosed is, according to the Women's Ban, the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits disclosure of such information and severely punishes violations."
"We're a lot of suspicion and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published restrictions, but I have received two very intense warnings that, if we do not stop, there will be harsh sanctions," Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the information continues to be published, the Commission may ask for money from the UEFA for education and arbitration development.
"They are very important to us."
"Without them we couldn't fill in the program for the education of arbitrators," Damková added.
Barty's detention is related to Janousk and Bém: Are they worth the escape of the messengers?
The President of the Public Victory Bart arrested the police on Thursday.
He was also arrested by the head of the committee of the anti-corruption police, Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the posts of the lobbyist Romano Janouška and former Prime Minister Pavlo Béma (ODS).
The information about the messengers with which the server of Novinky.co.uk has been confirmed by the Czech Press Offices by a reliable source.
The telephone calls Janousk and Béma, published last March in the Youth Front newspaper Today, in which both men are mutually entitled "Mazanka" and "Kolibrika", show the influence of Janousk on the steps of the city under the leadership of Bém.
The newspaper said that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the ABL Security Agency.
That was what Bart had.
Server Novinky.cz has noted that the arrested criminal Petržílek was working before his arrival to the anti-corruption police just for the BIS.
To the anti-corruption service, which subsequently addressed the posts, Petržílek passed at the same time as they were published.
"In view of the law on the protection of secret information, I can't confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský from the City Representative in Prague.
He refused to confirm that the case was supervised.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six companies in ten are preparing for a new civilian law
Six companies in ten are intensively prepared for the coming effect of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporation Act from 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company’s respondents said that issues related to both key codecs in their company did not solve at all.
This results from an investigation by the Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal lawyers, which found opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the nearest term of effectiveness of both key codes, only at the last moment, a number of managers begin to realize how they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in privacy law in the past 50 years are, in our view, affected by all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Due to politics lavish, the entrepreneurial sector has long lived in uncertainty whether revolutionary changes will eventually occur or not.
"But now they have only a few weeks left to move to a new right without complications for their companies," said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačil.
Of 61% of the firms involved intensively in the new laws, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35% of these companies are ready to take the necessary measures in the near future.
However, every five companies haven’t been involved in the revisions yet, but they have a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and the problem is unable to assess.
Only 8 percent of companies admit that issues related to revisions have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue relating to the new civilian law is, for the largest number of companies concerned, the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), the solution to trade conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the real estate catastrophe and the responsibility for damage (about ten per cent).
The treaty is one of the most important newsmakers of the entire revision, which is the unification of the treaty adjustment only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The present parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial law will disappear, resulting in the contractual right being more transparent for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer a lot of news with an emphasis on the greater freedom to organize relationships," Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddaný said.
In the context of the Commercial Corporation Act, nearly a quarter of companies are considered the most important subject to the issue of increasing the responsibility of the statutory authorities.
In addition, the topics relating to changes in the election and the course of the general assembly (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislative regulation means a clearance of obligations and possible impacts on statutory authorities, especially when companies are at risk of falling or getting into it.
"In practice, it means that if the members of the board and the operators of the company do not deal with the care of a proper economy and do not reverse the threatening failures of the company, they can benefit from the performance of the office in the last two years," Spächil said.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier's style develop as a live language
My task is to maintain tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a relic, explains Pierre Rainero, style director at Cartier in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house was founded in 1847.
It travels through bahn, rivers and jungles and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team will treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in Western Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Award.
In the 2013 CNN Award competition you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle was watching his father again and again, unconsciously, and traveling to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde during a car accident.
He was initially treated only with a broken arm, but then an infection that spread into the brain developed there, creating hematomas that caused him problems throughout his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We should take him out of Cameroon if we had money for that.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overfilled clinics and hospitals where he received such treatment that was simply available.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, hurry to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people die only because they have to wait.
Since 2002, Bwell's father died, the situation has not changed too much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Only for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the doctors of Cameroon could visit, many wouldn’t allow it.
Two out of five people in this country live under the poverty limit and nearly three-quarters of health care expenditure in this country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle says.
Because of poverty, they can’t enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffering, he decided to do something.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations last year.
She became a doctor at the central Yaounde hospital.
And he founded a non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas for the weekend, where they provide medical care for free.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 volunteers have helped.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are excited to supply, attach to the rooftops of medical needs and travel to the villages that need help.
Not always accompanied by happiness.
Suddenly, the vehicles must press through the river and the bahn.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as real heroes: host, singing and dance and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with its wide smile and uncommon energy – is very willing to join the local joy.
The next day the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients for each trip,” Bwelle says.
They come to the village of a circle of 60 kilometers, it's a walk.
During each of these weekends, doctors will provide a variety of medical care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, undernutrition, diabetes, parasite diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get beer or donated glasses or birth leaves for free – a document that the school requires, but which many rich families simply cannot allow themselves.
In the evening, the team makes simple operations under local drugs.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, in the municipality or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the other patient.
With the light from the generator, the operating room and Bwelle’s hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work within the early morning hours.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay awake and continue working, they play bubbles all night,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will return to the city, tired, but proud of his work.
This group, consisting of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year and realizes that their assistance can be significant for locals.
One man said he would be able to work again after surgery.
“This will change the future of our family,” he said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works for private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It says that this second job finances about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
“I’m not sure when he actually sleeps,” says Katie O’Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel’s University in Philadelphia next year and works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
It’s always in the hospital, or it’s trying to get money for the organization so that it can do these campaigns.
For students of medical and nursing services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle in his mission, it is a great practice they would not get at home.
"Dr. Bwellem washed hands deeply and removed blood vessels or we held his tools," said O'Malley.
As a medical student in the second year in America, you will never experience it.
Volunteers usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and often come with gifted medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaounde, Bwelle provides them with food, transport and study.
“It’s definitely a hero,” says O’Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is infinite.
For Bwell's permanent closure, it's not a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill the promise he gave his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy to do this,” Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking of my father.
I hope he'll see what I'm doing.
Laughing people, relieving their pain – that’s why I do it.
Take a look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how to help.
Minister Holcát restored the role of the chief nurse for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I think it is essential that these functions are clearly defined and formalized in order to have the nurses of their representative within the structure of the office - the representatives to whom they can always contact, if necessary," said Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurse, and I think that the nurse department deserves to be paid attention to him by the Ministry.
This profession requires not only high professionalism, but also human approach and personal conviction.
"I'm going to fall, and with all my responsibility I'm going to try to pursue the steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who are not too helping us with their approach to patients to perform their professions with all empathy and help us to improve the image of the nurses in public eyes," Alena Šmídová says.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídova, at the opportunity of entering her position, also stated that she wants to deal with the various aspects of the job position of the nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
“I don’t really want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with its own competence and together with other healthcare professionals, a team that provides health services for the patient.”
“I’m facing a number of problems that are occurring in the career of my sisters, I hate these and I’m going to participate in their solutions.”
These include, for example, simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
“I know from my own experience that some administrative actions are unnecessaryly burdened by sisters and take them time that they may and should rather devote to patients,” Alena Šmídova said.
Other areas on which it is intended to focus include improvements in working conditions, searching for ways to improve mutual cooperation in the team and with the management of healthcare providers, management of competences, as well as employment laws, such as compliance with the laws of employment or non-loading of nurses inadequate numbers at a given time and time.
We often hear anonymous tracks, which are not documented in a specific case where violations of the rules may occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Czech Chief Sister could serve as a guarantee of the preservation of the anonymity of such a complaint and a specific case to allow the competent authorities to verify," Alena Šmídova concluded.
Dr. Alena Šmídova graduated from the High School of Health in the field of Nurse (degreed in 1978) and from the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Karlovy University in Prague in the study program of Nursing - Pedagogy (degreed in 1992).
Since 2010, he has served as the head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical fields and the recognition of qualifications at the Committee of Education and Sciences of the MZČR.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bed at the internal department, and continued to serve as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also a statutory representative for eight years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the chief sister of the Czech prison service.
She published several professional nursing lectures and articles in professional journals, dedicated to nursing lectures.
He is not a member of any political party.
I don't want to hate
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) issued a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it is not a pleasant link, it indicates the number of pages comparable to its most famous work Houština (Peter, 2001).
For the Salon Kahudu, another significant Czech writer today, Emil Hakl, was spoken.
What happened when you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so that I couldn't get rid of hatred.
Seeing around yourself the new and new clones of the human eagerness, young organisms affected by blind self-esteem.
I don’t talk about us older people, faces destroyed by the powerless desire, universe souls, and vice versa, overwhelmed ideologists who try to sell their "product" with the expression of small salesgirls.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and recorded my juridial friends, wonders, and hidden offices.
I've got it already.
Sometimes I feel my brain is burning from my life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks and then read a book at the lights of the night.
You're talking about the feeling of death, hatred.
Is there some sort of evil in the past that has affected you, or you're just ageing, like all of us?
It happened a long time ago, about 10 years ago.
There was no name at that time.
Well, and I lived after that.
There's still a quiet guy inside.
I see another lonely coach, everybody on their tournament of anxiety.
It saved me by writing books.
I participate in this revolving, thousands of years of ongoing movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of that incomprehensible future.
That incomparable, breathing complexity of life, when every stone is the direct inheritance of our presence.
We are the players of sad and beautiful games, where by the way of try-omyl, the next and next generation of beings, which in billions of interactions per second create some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years are relatively long.
Do you perceive your writing as a continuous process, or have you started completely from zero?
Self-contracting, or better spoken, dialogue that leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows to the level and forms in the book.
As the peace period is overwhelmed by the quietly sleeping metastases of wars, which may be awakened one day, so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt how my life laminate grows in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'll be silent.
It is a set of questions that the brain has formulated and puts them into layers that are stored in the dark "under the level of consciousness".
Neokortex, a grey brain curve, asks older evolutionary departments, goes to the ancient flying circles of the brain tree.
He speaks to wild beasts, he asks for birds, he seeks an answer in the flight of birds, he turns his eyes to the clouds.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the egu metaphorical - can you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences and experiences that a person has experienced.
This forest, which is logically and emotionally exposed and branched with information trees, memory records, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to constantly changing presence, in an unexpected attempt to designate and understand its surroundings and decodify important messages.
Sometimes there are overload disorders.
Analogically - as if you "call" a PC, from the speaker emulsion program and translators from foreign languages, you would first get stuck in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few failed restarts ended at the dark green pop-up screen of Bios, in the basic system that controls the functions and processes at the operation board and mother cooperation.
For those who have not yet understood what it is, I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
Do you remember her often - why do you care about this type of regrese regularly?
Because it's jama.
In the post-functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behaviour - there will be fluctuation.
It's good to quote Nietzsche: "So long he looked into the collapse until the collapse looked into him."
It risks the feeling - that a person is lost if all hopes disappear, mentally "dead" and a new quality emerges.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer the parable.
One of them fell into the pit, and ran days, months, and summers, and he still ran, and then read, and the books taught him to swim - so to live.
He became a "repeat."
I hope somebody will help me a phrase written by me, like once the texts of the Harbal helped me.
To what extent do you mean the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one who can't tell anything meaningful, one of them calls it consciousness, another super eczem, but I think that's the best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in his friend's letter:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and phrases."
From early childhood he read the books of old Czech witches, sailing in the navy of Captain Nema, running through the Shadows in dark streets.
At the same time, behind all the industry of the authors and their message, it is "The sun is clear to the worlds of other Karl Hynk Macha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
Do you get the back reflection that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, perhaps after years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult decisions.
The books are actually "life" or better called "worlds".
They are encoded in the characters of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of the language.
We can awaken them to life when we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It is, in fact, in its way, something forbidden of divine - awakening other and other life stories, small spaces and temporary planets.
It is the fact that the DNA of which is stored in the line - according to old demological books, we do witchcraft.
After publishing the book, you - as it is - are waiting for a chain of author readings.
I remember you once liked to read.
Are you going back to it again with joy, or do you feel it differently after years?
I'd rather just tell you that today.
And what did I find out about it?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic signs - they're not apparent, they're not too careful, they're friendly, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope he still lives) a cudrined bookmaker (which is randomly called June), a happy couple and a good girl boy.
At one drinker, he introduced me individual articles from the chain of my readers’ book Houština.
I looked into their eyes, and then I was shown to be broken, a hundred copies of my book.
I just laid down a distorted motherfucker in despair and wept shortly.
All of us were standing there, kidding, and drunk with the breastfeeding.
Then the young blonde mixer did not endure and jumped through the head from the window to the snow belt with a row.
It was on the ground floor.
We walked into the night landscape, and we threw out the happiness of the sensitive, the painful souls of the countrymen and the steak of the west of the countrymen - they went out and moved like wolves until the morning.
Each book is formally and content different from the previous one.
Is that true for the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It is a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novel, Suchodol puts in the mouth the words of an old Russian poem: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog, a grey doll on it.
Horror, fear, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
Maybe we've been devils in hell a long time ago and lost - what role we're going to play on this earth.
Are you going to continue writing, or are you going to let it go again on the free inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar March.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something of huge and unnominable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet affects our desires from so deep and so wide that it completely crosses our horizon - and thus, with absolute clarity, we do exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded with the addition of dopamine, a mixture of endorphine and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to partake, die in the defense and acquisition of new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disturbance and we'll burn compassion.
Only then we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - a biological robot is already full of various disorders, stands on the coast of the ocean unconsciousness and into the dirty plaque made from a dirty pocket catches the floods of the wet wind.
I have to write to be a man.
Obama resigns from health care
After the wave of criticism yesterday, President Obama resigned from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
The president has been accused of lies in the U.S. public by appealing to hundreds of thousands of statements from the Republican providers in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama was rejected from his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have functional health insurance can keep them,” he said in his speech in Boston.
With regard to what he called a “release in the media” on statements, Obama called for the Americans who received the announcement to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive healthcare program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You’ll get a better offer,” he said.
His administration argues that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not comply with the new requirements provided by the Act on available care.
“I’m telling these Americans at the level: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in a statement before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who is supervising the implementation of the Act on available care, said that the launch of the Internet market has been "desperately" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Injured by Sebelius, this phrase captured by the microphone, went to the consultant behind her at the Committee's yesterday negotiations after a storm exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, representative of the Missouri programme, who had to discuss whether she should be behind herself.
More than three hours during the hearing of Sebelius repeatedly asked why the "architect" did not voluntarily give up the government’s sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program via HealthCare.gov, which is now involving millions of Americans.
What billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and, according to the various sources from agencies and incubators, it is already a hand in the handle.
The transaction should be announced in November, probably before the LTE frequency auction starts, that is, before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
This was left to the auction of frequencies for the LTE network under the brand Sazka Telecommunications.
And to the general surprise, the taste of the company to enter the telecommunications has not been spoken until then.
However, Sazku is now led by a very experienced telecommunications wizard Robert Chvátal.
He began as the marketing boss of Radiomobile (Today T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovak T-Mobil and last of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The game plays a few cards at once.
She entered the auction and now admitted she wanted to launch a virtual at Vodafone.
And it gives logic.
If the auction succeeds, you will be able to move existing customers from your own virtual operator into your network.
It would probably not like Vodafone in normal circumstances, but according to Economic Journals, it could be part of a much closer collaboration between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently undergoing an agreement between O2 and T-Mobile competitors who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE tender (as a newborn can pull out a specially defined spectrum), then Vodafone will not be able to pull into the auction at all, and, respectively, it will not be able to miss the output of a limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can be shared with Sazka on the network.
Vodafone releases the Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respectively a newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to start a fast network.
The relationship begins to build a cost-effective LTE network, which will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone would then be able to spend money on a firm internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
The purchase of the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech) would immediately acquire a full operator with still decent gains and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it’s a big flour that will wait for restructuring.
In the LTE auction, Kellner would already win for the O2 and most likely in collaboration with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already stated that they will share their networks.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is enjoying.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk calls.
Or two titans of the Czech business against global turns.
Will the Czech TV ever go without signing events?
To the age of President Zeman entered a legendary scene with a pencil, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that collect evidence of the prosecution of the castle family.
In the past, the influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík did not document any of these even to sign under it.
True, the directors stopped.
However, the described cases do not answer the question of where some journalists’ affection to the Zemanovs are taken – whether it is a response to direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of invisible empathy.
And if we are already assuming general flexibility, it is impossible to forgive the question of whether the change of relationships in the TV is not forced by other, at least unscrupulous power interests that have yet to have no opportunity.
It is true for those who say that in advanced countries there are no attempts at the intervention of politicians in broadcasting.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there would be no complaints on public media.
The complainants do not doubt their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mostly what they consider to be a tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we haven’t grown into this stage of civilization yet, and this situation isn’t with us.
But maybe also in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories of bad politics and good journalists spend more conveniently than more complicated descriptions of an unclear situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: Presidents on the border of forces
It is almost the rule that in the key moments of the country, the head of the state was not in such a form that it could fulfill its national obligations.
If T. Masaryk was physically and mentally younger for five years, the end of his presidential period and the events around Munich would take place a little differently.
We would probably not win the war, but after a symbolic resistance, the airline could fly beyond the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could fly to London immediately and worry about its legitimacy there.
And mostly, from that chapter, the nation would not have cocktail.
Beneš was not a citizen and was still in condition for Munich, but during the war he began to go out of the hill, and in February 48 he continued to do so.
Being about something better, he could go to exile for the third time and break down the legitimacy of the Communists and their guns.
It's bad to talk about Hach.
He was chosen by the fact that "the president would not come into the situation to decide."
But he had to, although the great decision with a knife at Hitler's neck was probably not in the Chancellor.
The boss of intelligence, Francis Moravec, said in the last days of March 1939, everything to do so that the occupation he knew exactly about the day did not pass so smoothly and with such gains to the Germans.
Senil president and the white government did nothing, yet they did not believe him, yet they were afraid.
The human concern of Gottwald allowed him to execute his flying co-workers, as Moscow ordered him.
Ludwig Sloboda has definitely disabled the share of normalization and had to settle it, already completely senile.
That Hushak was a powerful and sick depressive old man in November 89, but it was the only relief.
Havel was lucky that he wasn't in the office for the last few years, he was saved the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis retirer, but many of his acts make it clear that thought processes are no longer what they had been.
Well, now we've got this.
The head of the state and the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces look like it looks, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's threatening, it's just not so seen.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally not good (in the historical perspective) that the president is not entirely in power.
But the normal condition is not.
Can we choose a president in this country once again, someone who is acceptable and acceptable to be healthy?
Remote planets, black-white films, or some imagination of alien life on earth are not themes that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would find.
In the concept of his quartet, which will end this year’s annual festival of the Struna autumn on 6 November in the large hall of Prague, Lucerny, is all related to everything.
The partiture of the jazz quartet of saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as fully improvised chamber affairs and think not of harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
However, this principle, a freshly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, wearer of nine grammes, former co-player Milese Davis and probably the largest living jazz saxophonist today - does not like to explain.
He does not speak too much of music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my eighty-year-olds, I found that it was best to let my life surprise.
“Too many people plan everything and are disappointed when things develop differently,” Shorter says.
How Thai Inhibitors Released Markets of the Paris Bar
Maybe you’re shaking over the poison, while you don’t realize that you dream about half a kilogram per year completely voluntarily.
For example, in the moon.
If you consume it consciously, then you are obviously trending: it’s ecological, nutritional, and you’ve also taken care of a unique experience.
In Paris, Elie Daviron, the cookwriter and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar, was the first to serve his business’ dining ticket at the beginning of October.
The bar, for which the name was inspired by William Burroughse Naked Lunch book, would be found in the 18th fashion district near Montmart of a lot of tourists.
With fresh avocado, pinned red peppers, bulbs and chicken eggs, the guest can newly taste not only various larves, cowboys or water brownies, but also taste sharks.
Carefully and specially packed supplies (to prevent the insect from hurting the wings, crushing the legs or damage the eyes) are sent to Daviron only from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, where it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneer menu lists a few reasons to consume the same insect.
The first of them is the ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (which concerns finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, the insect is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, a young cook doesn’t end its profession, it simply aims to offer its customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant of pleasure, feeling sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would probably be inspired by the idea of consuming a brownie decorated with pests, but the responses of the Paris bar customers to a serving insect are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they will eventually taste, even when they begin with the smallest neighbourhoods and finally choose their scorpions.
The prices of these degustative plates range from five to nine euros.
Chairman of the Construction entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matthias: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and I am not interested in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The release of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save significant amounts for heating after the implementation of the measure, but also opportunities for construction companies and construction equipment manufacturers.
Each invested billion will bring to the state more than 2,700 newly created jobs.
From the point of view of state fiscal policy, significant strikes and multiplication effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
Consequently, the union of construction entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic is fundamentally disagreed with the decision of the government and requests the implementation of steps that would allow further continuation of the programme to be made known to further challenges within it.

The dog shrews the bowl, the president buried and ended with Berlin
President Miloš Zeman left a motel hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on his bed and went to the castle in Lanech.
What health is it in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said American spying “has gone too far”
John Kerry pointed out that the U.S. defence attitudes in relation to his tracking programs were softened, and in an unprecedented confession, he said that in some cases spying “has gone too far.”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for having acted as a "autopilot" in view of the angry revelation of the NSA's spying activities, which came out thanks to the informer Edward Snowden.
The information published was triggered by a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video connection at an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the president and the others in the government have actually learned about some things that have been shared from sustainability because there was this opportunity, with reference to World War II, the difficult period after Cold War, and of course afterwards.”
He became the first high-established member of the U.S. government to admit that American spying has crossed the border, but stressed that it did not violate the rights.
He said, “In some cases it went too far.”
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and now he is carrying out a thorough review so that no one feels that abuse has occurred.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA strives for good and that its tracking operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to burn themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to killing and throwing people into the air and attacking governments.
What if you could catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented aircraft from falling, buildings did not explode, and people were not killed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The President of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. legislators are preparing to go to Europe to respond to alleged American spying concerns and convince Europeans that they need to continue to join their forces in fighting terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he talked to European Parliament members and other people and that he was worried about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because they are disturbed by monitoring the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the U.S. national security interests, it is really important that Europe remains on one ship with us, in view of joint efforts to combat terrorism, said in an interview with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the Senator of the Senate's Foreign Relations Subcommittee for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in fighting terrorism regardless of their affection for NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of telephone records in Europe disrupted relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Another revelation cited the documents announced by Snowden that the NSA watched the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 world leaders.
The head of the National Report James Clapper defended the Allied Spy as necessary and said it was a common matter on both sides.
In the middle of Murphy's shouting, he said his office plans a parliamentary journey to take place this year, and hopes that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the next few days, the names of other lawmakers who want to participate will be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the road’s aim is to help correct relationships, he added that they will also be prepared “good-minded educational measures”.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people in terms of spying programs that they are using for years.
“While we adjust our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to realize that we are not the only one doing spying here,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry plans this weekend to go to the Middle East and Poland to respond to fraud, which has already created U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. monitoring activities.
Australians appeal against staying in Thai prison
A 19-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to fifteen-month prison on the island of Phuket, when she actually claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, she appealed to the dictatorship and was released on a charge.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged by the ground court on the island of Phuket for a cruel charge when the Thai police said the taxi driver and the other two men who said they had arrested her had attacked her on Sunday morning on June 10.
However, the recording from the industrial television later revealed that after she divorced with her Australian friend she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police conducted conversations with Bamford two days before she found out she had invented the incident.
He was held before the trial in the local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days jail in a low-covered periphery facility in Phuket, instead of being placed in jail for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks who, in the case of his daughter, asked for assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Southern newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
“Obviously this is a challenging period, but we hope it will come back to us as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and has been released for a deposit of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that he spent his holiday in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
The law sources in Thailand argue that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that appeal could lead to a court proceeding that would increase her punishment and lead her to a place of imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent killing of an Australian travel office employee Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to fix a dishonest image for tourists, which may have just been behind a freeing dictatorship.
The player laughed: Gone out of the breast?
He got a gun in the defense belt and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, the escape changed after a quick forensic call.
Jaromír Jágr scored this way against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night the 119th NHL win goal commented on Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent, Peter Svobod, asked the Czech Dear Director and asked him if I wouldn't have an interest in advertising on their most modern train Pendolino!", he wrote on the introduction with a surname of Jágr.
They say we're typically much similar.
I'll probably have to finish my night training so I don't have to go even faster.
"I am afraid he could then call the Defence Minister and want to make an ad on the press," he added.
New Jersey also scored the second victory in the row.
"And most of all, you noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova takes," Jágr concluded.
Place of licensing candle licensing gullah
The October elections rather than the winners brought the cup of the defeated.
They are not only parties that have not entered the House (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the Czechoslovakia because of their internal breakthrough.
The politicians, instead of the holiday candles, served on the weekend's leisure gualth.
The elections took place in the movement of Andreje Babishe, which promised voters to change the political style of governance to date.
The disruption of the election result and the triumph in the victorious side is recorded by the political (by)for President Miloše Zeman, regardless of the wish of voters who have neither elected the party that President Zeman publicly supported nor elected to the parliamentary House.
Due to the unpleasant event, the president has lost a strategic surplus against other politicians, but there are still several ways to get it back – for example by choosing a future prime minister.
While the Czechoslovakia’s chances of getting a prime chair in my eyes are distant, entrepreneurs are approaching Andrej Babiš on the contrary.
The development of law is far away from the early and smooth establishment of a stable government, but in comparison with the electoral scenario of the left-wing government of the Czech Republic supported by the Communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy is just a better news.
Due to the voice resistance of ANO to be given together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely to be a variant of the CSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (total 111 Members).
Due to the decline in the Czechoslovakia, which has become an unreasonable and weak party in negotiations, the result of coalition negotiations can be quite challenging for the Czechoslovakia.
The minority government of the Czech Republic, composed of "Nationalists" in the game, is probably not going through.
In addition, any government that will participate in the Czech Republic will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead to further disintegration in the side.
So I ask myself, "Can't we be able to take care of other early elections?"
Other elections would rather be a referendum on the power of the electoral mandate of the ANO movement.
The CSD’s plans for sectoral taxation, significantly increased income taxation or government bank building have fallen under the table.
On the contrary, the Parties to the Czechoslovakia, the KDU-ČSL and the Usvit agree, for example, on the support of business, changing fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the support of employment of disabled persons, lower VAT rates for selected goods.
The third area is most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but now I have a suggestion, so the program is the most likely coalitions ANO, CHSSD, KDU-ČSL would rather be charged to the right.
What, in my view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
