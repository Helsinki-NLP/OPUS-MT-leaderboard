When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population, de de de de de (like if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed, they still need the same adaptations as before.
In the meantime, as the new population begins to adapte to their new environment, they begins to look less and less like the other population.
Ultimately, after millenniums or even millions years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Desafortunadamente, studiar traffic flow is difficult because conducte drivers can't be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunatamente, los conductores tienden a comportarse dentro de un rango razonablement consistent; consecuentemente, los fluxos de tráfico tienden a tener un poco de coherencia razonable y pueden ser aprox. mathematically represented.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.

Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate group physical.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
