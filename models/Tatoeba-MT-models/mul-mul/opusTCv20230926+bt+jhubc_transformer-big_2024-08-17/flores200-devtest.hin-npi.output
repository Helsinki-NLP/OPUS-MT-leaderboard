Desafortunately, it's difficult to study the traffic folder, because behavior of drivers can't be predicted with 100 percent certainty before.
Luckily, drivers walk within a reasonable harmonization limit; thus, there is some reasonable stability in the traffic flow and may be shown mathematically largely.
In order to show traffic flow in a better way, three main features are linked: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) veg.
This relationship helps in the operations of planning, design and road equipment.
