A Republican Strategy to Against Obama’s Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth, claiming that election fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by the flood.
In addition, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
In this spirit, a majority of U.S. governments have adopted new laws that make the process of registration or voting harder since 2009.
This phenomenon increased after the November 2010 elections, which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a consequence, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the only year of 2011.
The new electoral law requires voters to present an identity card with photo and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce pre-voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the voting and withdraw citizens with a judicial case of their voting right.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities urged to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have discussed bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo-identity card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards such as health insurance cards.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people aged to vote, do not have identity cards with photo issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than $100 to get the required identity card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people winning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years old and 20% of voters over 18 to 29 years old do not have the required identity card with photo.
Much more.
Students, who are considered voters to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with photo issued by their institution.
On the contrary, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required evidence of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws demanding voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
He said that two of the three Hispanic voters are favoring the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators agreed in 2011 on laws abolishing voters' registration on the day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are no consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, voters' registration campaigns contributed to recording about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 decreased the number of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States to reduce the period of pre-voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the predetermined voters were Afro-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state voters.
It was the same with the Spanish.
They represent only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites who represented 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voters' inscription.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetos of Democratic governors.
The U.S. lawyer has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requesting the presentation of an identity card with photo.
However, the new rules implemented will undoubtedly make the exercise of voting right in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted and see a clear goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to be sure that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new arrangements will negatively influence the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Diagnosis of prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes have wrong results, with false negative or even false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to make even more hesitant men who are already opposed to pass testing.
Do you pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have strong recommendations.
Another European study concluded a difference in mortality between patients who have been investigated and those who have not been investigated.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if not detected.
So I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old, if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are bad.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and rather opting for active surveillance of the disease in such cases.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will suggest them to do active monitoring, and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
More and more, the criteria are determined to decide who should or should not be treated.
Therefore, I recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a conversation with your doctor to determine whether you should go through it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember created a tool to assess the APS test for and against.

Prevent the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite research progress, adoption of good life habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If nobody smokes anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This affects the health of people.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Québec,” spokeswoman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after leaving the cigarette, the risk of death of cancer falls half.
The weight
The embonpoint and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“The research shows that regular exercise of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” he added.
The Nutrition
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too many amounts, it increases the risk of having colorectal cancer.
Charcoal also, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or saling may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“These can damage the cells of the body and lead to cancer development,” they explain.
Vitamins
Over the past few years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them noticed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noticed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a test doesn't give cancer."
Higgs's Boson Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs's boson created a whole emu, last summer, and for cause.
We believe that this boson is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the universe, nothing but that.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "mist" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicians, it’s not quite sure if it’s Higgs.
We know the shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it looks much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Additionally, new data disclosed this week at a large congress of physics in Kyoto seems to confirm it, but there is still lack of data to be absolutely sure of it.
Let's assume that it's Higgs well, because the chances of mistakes seem thin, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally inevitable law wishing that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to violate this rule - and do not try too hard, you will hurt yourself.
Even though the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of Pauli’s exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantic state” - that “state” consists greatly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicians classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens named farmers, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other hand, the bosoms, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for nothing - in any case, not for this principle, which means they can be beautifully located at the same time.
These bosoms are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, on the other hand) The Particle Adventure, the Berkeley Laboratory: the Mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which Higgs’ bosoms would somehow be apparent.
These bubbles, we need to point out here, are not all as exotic animals as we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "message" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerating or changing direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this specific location, a little like a rock thrown into a stain.
From this "disturbance" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "power carriers" bosoms.
A more stable field
It is the same with Higgs's boson, at the same difference that it is nearly another field, the Higgs's field, which must be "disturbed" so that this boson appears.
But this Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energy, a little as if it was a ice cream of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That’s why we need an immense particle accelerator like that of CERN – the Large Hadron Collider is a 27km circle ring! – to reach such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles or materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold onto a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while others (like the photon, yours) do not have it.
Now, what is "can" bring all these researches, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicians to examine any difference between MS observations and predictions.
In addition, they are many to wish to be found, because the least difference could open a door on a “new physical necklace” and mock some holes of the Model.
This one, to be said, still has huge shortcomings, without providing any explanation for the gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (re-ops!).
But we haven't found any such differences in the CERN so far.
Repercussions
The impacts of these researches in Mrs. All-Mundo's daily, they are more difficult to predict, but it would have been wrong to assume that there would be no such thing.
At the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers, at Bell Laboratories, were in no way suspicious of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were involved in scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already told physician Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first was pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was rather seen as a "labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although it wasn’t his original intention at all, now serves as an eye to all digital cameras in the world, and he has earned the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
This does not, of course, mean that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... | The Duty
With its Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon as a draft law is prepared.
But, in this essential field, there is still a lot to do.
The duty tried to look closer at it.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that swallowed him had left him a two-year relapse.
"They had given me five years to live, I've been seven years," he said, a half-figue half-raisin, stretching in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the evening.
“But it’s still a shock, we can’t be prepared for it,” he said.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attached in front of an appetite lunch, he agrees to leave himself to help meal, resigned.
Bravely, he even comes to smile, speaks to the strangers who deal with him, brings him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to heal me from diarrhoea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this problem.
“During our lifetime, we learn that a man is standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’ home.
Retreating to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he said.
Because, from the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
They have a life forecast of up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer prodigue so-called "cure".
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and exhausted."
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she added.
“I don’t have any desires in my life anymore,” she says, before I accept that they put her a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for a last visit to her son coming from Italy in the next few days.
At Victor-Gadbois, we prodigue, with a group of volunteers, body care and food help.
These are palliative cares, which you give when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether it’s at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you will agree to provide mouth care to the brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help close people as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, Care Director.
At Victor-Gadbois’ house, the days follow but do not look like one another.
Beside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the court, well fallen in his necklaces while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying to survive.
“For six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by cancers under 45 years of age,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to calm down suffering when a sick has reached the final phase of his life, whether at home, hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the palliative care company at home of the Grand Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancers.
This is precisely the great lack of Quebec health care that causes several specialists in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law encouraging euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed with summits of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to prove their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing enough to ensure that everyone has the right to palliative quality care before you agree to proceed with euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I have seen a patient spending 14 days in an emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve it.
I am afraid that patients are only asking for death because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists are sharing on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helen Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she abandoned a proven chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stopped the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was over!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the nurses for not accessing their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it should be said that palliative care is not absolutely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the home palliative care Society of Grand Montreal, patients would be refracting to pain treatments in 8% of the cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sediation, which returns to sleep the patient until his death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer seem to hear that part of suffering.
In addition, the unreliefed patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedimentation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence, "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to eutanasiate me,” that means “I want to be relieved.”
This reporting has been made possible through a journalism scholarship from Canada’s Health Research Institute.
Large-scale real estate scandales in Quebec
Wealth officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party funds collectors and Italian mafia specialists report day after day what they know about a formidable "system", mixing building industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafia.
A " industry " which was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been excited since we took the great means," ironized Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former Montreal police officer.
It was by him that the scandal was scattered in 2011, through a thorough investigation of malversations related to roadwork contracts in Quebec, to which then Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only agreed to retreat.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and corruption of officials.
“Since the start of the 2010 investigation, the only transport ministry would have saved $1 billion on contracts,” some refreshing their instincts to touch a quote-part!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already made two mayors fall,” he added, hoping it will be able to “demonstrate stratagèmes behind individuals”.
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, founded in 2011, also joins its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
More police from the "squade Marteau" who since 2009 would have led Montreal's "cartel of exodus" to put the pedal soft on contract influxs...
In recent weeks, she has conducted serial investigations and has been charged with fraud and corruption against municipal electors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a municipality.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected that he has repeatedly employed pots-de-vin in exchange for public contracts.
They are also officially accused of engineers at Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of procurement of public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who reversed the money to Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito planted all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals at the time.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for former Liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Emissions contracts that inflicted costs
In Montreal, the “corruption system” worked round.
Surprising Gilles, a former public work engineer, made it very detailed before the committee: in ten years, he received gift construction companies, invites to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and wine pots, totaling $736,000 in exchange for contracts of equations, which he inflicted costs.
Other police officers admitted that they were fatiguing the leg by inflating 30% to 40% of the invoices, by fake extras.
Then, a Mayor’s party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cashes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, floating Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected ones to shoot the alarm soundtrack.
Mayor of the Riviera-des-Prairies district, east of the island, rises from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be launched, she says it “smites on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by furniture, to stop gangrene and embed the blame.”
The process, she said, is “painful but positive.”
We're cleaning the wound, but we'd need an investigation unit in Montreal and one night, so that we don't see the suspicious practices come back.
As we do the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "functionary has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected to know the stratagem", when they didn't tremble in the whale!
Estimateing 70% of the dirty money in the financing of Quebec electoral campaigns, he ironized: "It was told that it was just a big reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations to the parties, but this will not change it, according to him: "Unless strictly restricted election expenditure, there will be dirty money in politics."
He proposes a comprehensive review of the system of public contracts and party funding: "We cannot go lower; go down to things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on more solid grounds, with more control and laws."
If this story tears the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look at their own courtyard...
"The PSG isn't the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you’ve taken a new enigma with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I move alongside them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On the daily basis, these elements push me to lift my level of play.
And, in match, it's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't burn myself.
From my beginnings to the preforming center of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by stairs.
You will therefore benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are accustomed to fighting very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me wants to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He's swept by deputy deputy like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Yeah, of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with huppy clubs.
He joined great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In Liga 1, Lyon took us as a leader.
But we're still in embroidery.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we are qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have the word to say in front of very good European teams.
First we want to finish the first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th return final.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the duration.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to put this title as a champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We made a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much of the PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot of us because of what has been invested and the players we have.
We're totally accepting it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and still find things to reproach us, it's a little frustrating.
I wonder what people are waiting for more.
We will never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we could respond to presents.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't been able to qualify for the 8th of the final for two seasons, they've also made huge expenses!
With regard to the amounts invested, you were imagined with 15 points in advance at the trunk!
It was to ignore our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which weren’t well last season, were “bound” by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have a smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally overcome it.
The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s operations.
It's better to say there's a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performing and that he puts a lot of goals.
He's here for this and he's proven that he's the star of the 1st League.
He demonstrated everywhere he passed that he was a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This pushes others to lift their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing the game time.
I've seen things there and I've gone out of it.
Today, I can make good selection matches.
That’s what I’ve been expecting since my baptism with the Blues.
We have taken lessons from what happened in Ukraine and we have to have an exemplary behaviour today.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps to the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is strict, close to players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
White had reached its goal by qualifying us for the euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the right null (1-1) pulled out on October 16, in Spain a founding match?
This match has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived a similar match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system is made of bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pair-to-pair files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a top of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today around a ten dollars (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is distinguished from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But, every time, a central authority controls and handles exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both accounts book depositors, checkers, currency emitters, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the way of an email.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring the anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
Thus, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, spread across the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on computers, and the winner, somewhat temporary central banking, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hacking phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right.
The transaction is then indestructively linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the fingerprint.
If, to fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprints.
The computer who solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are split up to 100 million, leaving the margin.
The difficulty of the challenge is also associated with each increase in computing power.
The network’s life has already been up and down.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-value payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports money laundering opportunities thanks to this anonymous service.
Cash also has this deficiency.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, "Great Solds" were launched.
“Three thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a non-contact mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus become cheaper.
The carrier manages its identity more and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to operate with traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just give them an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who assures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general dismissal of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to impose, but 2013 could be a turn,” he said.
In addition, in its report, the ECB plans to re-evaluate the various risks today considered high in the event of success of this currency.
We are leaving Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to rebuild its territory and the Afghans to choose their future without waiting for us.
These are especially the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse foreign military presence, such as Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan, Tadjiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local rebels, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with amandiers thanks to French credits, was made in order.
Trucks and army convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflowed by helicopters.
There will be no defeat of the Taliban on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their country control was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of obscurity of these farmers beyond the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Ex-Modjahidin, the Afghan and current Taliban government are joining in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notes of the anti-Soviet War returned to power in 2001.
They turned into affairists, sending government lands to sell them back to lands to rebuild refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subtraction contracts.
They were disregarded; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, seek a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as they will leave those who have learned to enjoy the American width: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They joined the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls like boys.
Youths who will no longer want to return to the obscurity of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders will need to work.
All, including armed opponents, are freakers of mobile phones; the TV, and its Turkish sheets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about reconstituting provincial militia, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, to a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly during the elections scheduled in April 2014.
But its country has, since the 1950s, been dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restarted, no bargain is in a state, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, governmental control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise has been spread that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westers were there only to embrace it.
Without energy to deal with iron or copper mine on the ground, or means of transportation to export it through the mountains, there is no mine exploitation.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
It will also take a day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, will restore normal reports.
The departure of the French fighters ended on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French department to university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to "win the hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of coordinating aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has led, and conducted well by a small French NGO, many designs of collective interest and actions.
These work, local work gourmands, have been able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, pots, drinking water, boiling, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 meters of altitude.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the uprising led by foreign groups, what farmers have said to me, it is necessary to maintain in their favour a small, well-controlled civil aid that directly touches them.
A Constitution for Forces in Egypt
This is a new poker strike by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he decided to play his whole.
In court, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had assigned the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
Soon two years ago, Egypt has been based on a provisional text, several times amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "trade his word" and "people the right".
On the other hand of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way of ending it with the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article per article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic legitimacy, while the controversy is angry throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that Egyptians will vote favorably, as he claimed in an interview with American weekly Time.
As long as this use of a precipitated vote holds from the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text or I keep the full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, voted in the text yesterday.
Most Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they had clashed the door, estimating they had not been able to make their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, replacing members, were added to the hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
Without a surprise, it is most often by unanimity that the articles have been voted.
On the other hand, commentators have enjoyed the fact that one of the only divergences of the day had expressed itself around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee believe that the pendulum of the constituent was wrongly resolved.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Objectives of all attention, Article 2 remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of charia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace the "principles" by "rules," which would have enabled a more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a sign of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” the liberals reply, who only see a hit of communication.
Because they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
In particular, they refer to Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular in verifying compliance with the laws with the charia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is concerned because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of liberals are also drawn up by the fact that the next director of this university should be much less moderate than the current.
“For the moment, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the Civil State.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not olive, but universities, for some trained in the French system," tempered Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow to religious vocabulary.
This refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could be asked in the future to know to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the voted text yesterday has been very criticized due to the extensive powers it confers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers claim that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more than civilian trials in military courts will be prohibited, as human rights defense associations demand.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider liberal.
The blasphemy crime is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular the press.
In addition, no article no longer echoes the protection of women, Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself at television last night, protests are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of the state will take place on Saturday.
In Israel, sacred places, the World Center and a sea of samurai are waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the size of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has five major reasons to return to Israel.
Go to love the holy places
Be inevitable: the shore of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptizing funds” will be affected by Divine Grace.
But in Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed in wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
This is where Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
Believers are traveling through the Rue de la Patience or the Cross Road (in Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress of Antonia (the pretorium), where the trial took place, and then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, and then to that of the Peter of the Ointment and of the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is raised at the place where it grew the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Mur of the Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.E.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave there small words accompanied by prayers that are then exaggerated.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Massada fortress, an ancient refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the abrupt rocks of a mountain 450 m above the sea level.
Only alpinism fans can get there by their own means.
For the rest, a telephoner takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 meters of altitude, the Mont Hermont ski resort which hosts many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski tracks are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want Gentile gods to have once lived at the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
This country has nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really deserve the turn.
First of all: the Israeli Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Art Museum of Tel Aviv.
There are mainly the sheets of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
At Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths, composed of moulds of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free and donations are forbidden.
The fifth museum is Yad Vashem’s Holocaust or Memorial Museum, located in Tel Aviv, which goes on the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children’s memory, built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into a total darkness.
Scientious stars.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they are dead.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and well-being
The three major Israeli basin stations are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers pools, water parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
It is the world's most unique sea: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, or 417 meters below the sea level.
The blue water contains saumur and keeps the baths very easily, even those who don’t know swimming.
The landscapes around it are a surrealistic beauty.
There is a treatment based on salt water, lemon, cure bowls and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also for just relaxing.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquity
They are kept by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, here Noah built his ark and Perse saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists particularly love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, destiny will smile.
In Jaffa you can cross young married people who come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, King Herod, you can walk into the Roman theatre, "conquer the fortress of the crucified."
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, particularly of Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollar in the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today $1 is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haïfa has the only subway line of the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It is almost a subterranean funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, stores and public transport stop their activity.
And the work week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pigs, seafood, fish, and dairy and meat dishes.
There is a variety of lamb and goat-based dishes, soups and coconut milk-based desserts, but also houmous, traditional Jewish paste, various sauces, chicken bubbles, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the cities of Israel.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that come out of the air.
You can see them sleeping in the evening on the rooftops of parked cars.
These fans love past places and do not refuse to regulate them.
The rental of a car varies from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $ 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $15 per day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
It was mainly people coming to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists traveled to Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Which language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn language
While deputies and human rights activists question what the law will give to the mandatory linguistic test, frauds selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families staying at home.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant workers will have to pass a Russian examination.
Currently, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, services to individuals and retail sales.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will be mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, the knowledge of the language, but also the knowledge of the history of Russia and the foundations of law, will need to be validated.
You will need to validate his language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of the countries in which the Russian language has the official language status are exempted.
Those who received certificates or degrees of education before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 are also not subject to this law.
Benefits, negative attitudes and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the guidance of the Russian Language Institute Pouchkine, the University of People's Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to pass exams in all cities in the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened across the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the Members of the State Douma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly raised the question in the press: what will it give?
What is the obligation to know Russian will change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, according to representatives of the Migration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from slavery to work.
Many speak for defence of migrant workers' rights, says the director of the Office of the Russian Federal Ministry of Migration in Tadjikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems are for migrants without professionals, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross unfair people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a "road" to him in a overwhelmed house where he and dozens of his companions will be tormented for months without food and paper and will have to move between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“In their home, one thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they do not affect the planned salary,” said Tolib Charipov, head of the Head of Migration Services for the work of the Tadjikistan Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Police!
However, many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to come to make money in Russia believe that they do not only know the language of the country they want to go, but also that they hardly write in their own language.
Of course it is not their fault, but well their disaster: few Turkmenistans, Uzbekistans, and Tadjiks can allow themselves to follow it would be just a passable primary education.
In fact, their families don’t even have to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equiping them for school.
As soon as they get to adolescence, these young people go to make money as soon as the opportunity appears.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they trust.
"You feel less and love yourself."
However, human rights defenders observe an important aspect of the language law.
Examinations will be intended only for migrants who have a legal status.
Without a statute, there will be no official examination or work later.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defence to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia.
The administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 mile rubles.
And then, you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no recording, so the cases of extortion.
"They ask us about 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," said Umed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tadjikistan.
"Get fast, do not harm and buy a beautiful artwork"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several fake language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Fake papers come from an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who would hope to facilitate the examination task had to spend seven thousand rubles on this document.
It is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker 3,000 rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree to say that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper boots".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination for the first time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered to work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involved in legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to harden the law against civilian weapons carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is shooting or murder organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradv, who killed seven people.
Police want to prohibit the port of rubber ball guns in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the weapon port permit by passing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Committee for Security and Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Weapons Act would be introduced to the Douma State soon.
Not everyone is satisfied to see that Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by “setting the vessel”.
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demanding to abandon "this stupid hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal specialist for the BBC.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with firearms registered in police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that strengthening civilian weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, we can find any weapon in Moscow today at a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior states that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied via several channels.
The main channels are in the number of five, tells Victor Baranets, colonel of retirement serving ten years at the Ministry of Education and the Quarter General.
Screen capture drawn from a site taking weapons commands
The first is the "military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons coming from the black market are those defeated by criminals in order forces.
Baranets explains that it is both weapons stolen in police stocks and those demolished directly to representatives of the order forces.
Illegal guns are on sale since the military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"Verified versions indicate that some fires have been triggered in order to dissimulate the deficit," the former military said.
For Baranets, the gunmakers are there for something.
“We see private arms factories that are not competing with the international market and flowing weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow,” an expert says.
One of the other sources of the black market is the counterband.
An important part of guns and mitraillets come from poor countries, such as Kirghiziah.
"There is a local production, sometimes craftsmanship, a mafia has formed and organized the supply," the former military said.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Research for Public Administration.
Experts have analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and the forces of the order.
Half of the weapons present on the black market were found there “because of employees whose work is linked to the arms,” the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacturing and 5% are from "clandestin fools".
A vendor and consultant of an armchair who requested to keep the anonymity assures that no one has long purchased the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will find new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a teacher, for example a TT gun.
They deliver it to him by passing the goods through a grid.
"He transports it to the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the affairs, so when crimes are about to be solved, they are purchasing control from illegal weapons merchants," the seller added.
"As in a luxury shop"
The seller and buyer usually find themselves through knowledge.
I visited websites, blogs, until a guy appears and suggests to come to Begovaya station where someone should take me into a "coin" to trade.
The price of the gun was given to me.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, the seller explains. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors on the markets, but there is also a need to come here saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a teeth."
Now I even buy a pair of American ponds with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I will not give them.
Small new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried as an illegal weapon buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which he had "all that we want."
“I believed in a luxury shop,” the military remembers.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I am not happy to buy, we go with the seller in the forest and we install a target.
“I’m allowed to shoot, and when I’m convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating,” the expert explains.
A shop from its sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we don’t need any document and anyone to meet.
“It’s enough to have a precise amount of money,” the website said in an advertisement, “Buy a gun or a fighting wheelchair.”
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
What do we sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," the user asks "Ivan" (conserved orthograph).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast an enormous network of fake sites and collected people who wish to buy fighting weapons.

I have heard about this type of scheme: usually, the site is recorded outside the field of application of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer performs the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hid," the secretary of the association, Dmitry Kislov, said.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, we can find ourselves without weapons and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast an enormous network of fake sites and collected people who wish to buy fighting weapons.
"People run on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia," he said.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, according to experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Great to a weapon," you can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
It will have to wait about a month and a half.
It was released from long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes decreased by 7% in Russia as a whole and fell to 22.9 miles, while evidenced cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Fast-food and supermarket employees are in strike
Approximately a quarter of American teenagers are going through a boxing job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take scale or breathe quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left associations.
At the same time with the rise of modest wages perceived by basic employees at Walmart and in the fast restoration chains, the organizers of demonstrations wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the Black Friday, at the time when a rainfall of balances dropped by millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered screws.
That day, some employees of Walmart, who employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their position to organize strikes with trade unions and left activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for moderate and medium-sized consumers.
Walmart markets everything: from layers to hunting guns through car batteries, dust, eggs and milk.
On average, products are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid employees at Walmart run their race only at their workplace.
The price and selection of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to the reviews, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, particularly due to the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complains of difficult working conditions, such as the lack of elevators or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demand an increase in wages, they complained that the price of the company’s medical insurance increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who touches $9.5 per hour, it is a sum that he cannot afford.
Scientists from the University of California of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than it is currently spending.
If Walmart transferred the entire increase in salary on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend $12.39 more in just one year than now.
Walmart’s supporters are pleased to note that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the shops at 8:00 a.m. the next night and Walmart sold 5,000 items in the second period.
His cashes made 100 million transactions for the Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview at the Huffington Post site that in any "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com-operation among many others" by the organizing trade unions.
"The next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very appreciated, therefore they are not yet implanted) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you a sick leave and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York Municipal Council
Currently, the minimum wage provided by federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase them over time, but shortly, on average, their basic employees affect New York $8.90 per hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
I think it's inconceivable to live with this money in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teens worked at McDonald's after high school while living at their parents.
There are few people seeing their main source of income or wishing to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain to have to live with this wage and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don’t know what you’re going to feed them with.
The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near the McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that fast-food caisseries and cookboys be paid at least $15 per hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also asked for the establishment of trade unions in the fast restoration sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration of preventing and punishing the protesters of a trade unions by brimades or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, taking fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of the staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous protests took place near several other fast restoration chains.
The sharp time of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including Jumane Williams, member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announcement to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you a sick leave and don't pay you.
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats, particularly by the Mayor Bill De Blasio who said, "We must all support the employees of fast restoration to get a fair salary and economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this manifestation as the most important that the fast-food sector has known throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated without counting that not all were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
For the moment it is difficult to say if this mass movement breakthrough will make little ones.
“For the moment, we only get to get the brain on average.”
Recently, fans of new technologies have used to perceiving increased reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google revealed its current model this summer at its annual conference, and in November we learned that Microsoft had made the patent application.
However, from the interview with the director of the 3D Interactive Technology Group of the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tried by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the naked-handed air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your search team does?
We work on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity in its entirety remains at the moment on the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes on the touch.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years in front of us and guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the control by the gesture.
What is the future reserved for us?
Although Kinect has made physical interaction, many things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, is not really.
We try to change this and work on really 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to make the computer world out of our physical world, make it more touchful.
However, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
Thus, we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to start, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality casks!
What do you think of the vocal command?
She is appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of privacy is raised because we do not always want to inform others about his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the apparatus, but by a hand-drawn bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: geste + vote.
- That's what?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this basket?
You would do it with the word and the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it'll be hard to recognize.
So, do you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or not do at some point?
Not mandatory, but it is a mutual approach.
I think we will need to work very soon to develop new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
For example, it can be laser sensors, they produce quite good deep resolution and it is very important.
- If you are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
In principle, we are based on the current generation in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, which adds work to algorithm designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, has given sensors a regular treatment delay between 1 and 100 μs, while current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would certainly need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more frames in the second.
But shouldn’t you increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It does not use to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help to define locations.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the daily use of the technologies of increased reality, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking with a smartphone isn't convenient, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to move from glasses to smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal apparatus and that’s what makes them strong (the personal elements are the only ones you can see) and at the same time their weakness: increased reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with others.
- Imagine a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the deadly.
There is a problem on which opponents to this idea point the finger: there is no touching sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my courses, I often say that increased reality is the seventh percentage in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile feelings.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It's perfectly recording pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, at the moment still weak, of air breathing on the ends of your fingers.
There are also bracelets wearing on the pockets that affect the nerve ends of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And have you tried to deceive your brain?
Does it make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which will still take a long time to give up: the way to believe someone who is physically located in a very reduced space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of racing tapes (which can be seen with those in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also balls.
At the moment, only on average, the brain can be deceived, and many years of work are still left.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertility.
The Kingdom of Taste and Not of Culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'Avant-garde of Petersburg" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and who have found a recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather barbaric man, all dressed in red that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in branched festivities and vernissages.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always gather the crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
He is one of the so-called social and philosophical historians of Petersburg, one of the founders of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersbourgeois avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and put them in good mood.
He recently took in his hands a Barbarie orgue and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg as he had mature enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city while in red and not in yellow or in Turkish blue, for example?
- I chose the red as a cushion specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between painter, image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey causes aggressiveness and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- When did you realize that you should be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my work was.
I realized that it was my way.
So, the wave of old non-official painters was past and the new, free, in my genre, were uncomprehensible.
I started to connect with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave anymore.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must meet together.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends were singing easy play-back songs in moulding shirts, among them Igor Vdovin, a fashion composer today.
When the group began to occur live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg wasn't in a bad mood before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg, and that’s when his great career began, but his basic training and education is at our home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are the impacts of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that was when my kingdom ended.
It is not easy to work in a new era with ancient rules, I am a representative of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a culture person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognized style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong actuality and acuity.
I'm going to have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a socialist, it hurts today and it's scared to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything is deleted, the tragic falls.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory decay.
Today, it is the habit that matters, you are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him the hand, but we need to crash him to the throat.
And the lie will be deleted by the disguise.
We've recently seen you in the role of Barbarie's orga player. A cultural city must have such a type of hero.
Anyone other than I can play it.
But maybe commercial art can be beautiful as well.
- Today, commercial art must be careful, delicate, liquor.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Previously, people were shared in sheep, bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied one another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to please everyone.
Today, you need to think about who you will like.
Each shirt has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov!
"They're people we've thrown to see him, that's the sexual and social side that's walking.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and at the end of the account it’s less management, money, everything deprived.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to destroy the living.
When I was young, I painted pictures that a collector joined alongside Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually painted at the end of my life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in Saint Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good Tsars, it was not this way, the Tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that the good experts should be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are distracted, because we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and fragrance them a path.
Currently, it is the "government of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters that need to be found in other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very fine.
We have to make art fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.

Swimming in space
Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a murderer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with lands on board are starting to look for a rescue planet.
In order to save humanity, a big question is: how can we continue to live our species as an apprehensive or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's a lot of choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, only by assumption.
"It is Venus and Mars," Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the State Institute of astronomy P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to be interested in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we had experiments on plants.
Four generations of small beasts grown on orbit did not differentiate in any way from the soil.
Then we put on orbit of insects, small reproductive drosophiles.
In 1979, cattle eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo was developing as an appendix.
At the exit we get a completely normal puppy.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the pussy must find support, it must put on its legs and start moving," said Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
Without finding any support, the pockets were disturbed.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The pillows did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die after four days.
"We have two times shaved their eyes, and then abandoned them, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with the puppies in space.
The last "miniature arch" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring 2013.
However, biosatellite " Bion " will only embark on species of the same gender.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing overnatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We need to do this kind of research," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are still not performed directly in space.
It's not a thin business.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike the beasts, man is capable of it, in principle.
The Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The highest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most valuable.
Our mouse flew, and no one on Earth could say if it would stay after a flight in space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the missile and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk continues.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who haven’t had anything and who give birth to a healthy descendant after long flights.
“And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during orbital flights,” concluded the pilot and cosmonaut, the Soviet Union hero and Russian hero, Valeriy Poliakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of the preparation for the flight.
Here, in zero floatability, cosmonauts are trained by extra-vehicle outputs.
The water imitates the appetite.
If for adults, water is comfortable, but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
Small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother’s stomach, it is easier for him to get used to water.
It is logical, since from birth to his first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains the swim instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the obesity is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a weight force.
In spite, the muscles of the stomach, the pool atrophy very quickly, the baby’s push capacity is lost.
Okay, let's ignore this by pressing on the birth simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite him to think about this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel earth attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can’t dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be excluded from his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in an alien environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled, fully disillusioned child," said Igor Pestov, Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still theory.
However, with time this will become reality, when the Terriers will go into their vessels to a remote planet that will become the habitation of their descendants born in space.
The head of the ISC (Major Institute of Public Finance Control) said that " the control of the pseudo-independent work (in Czech " Švarc system ") failed due to politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is at the disposal for its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Institute of Public Finance Control, said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that’s what’s missing at us,” Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A check carried out jointly by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
It cites as an example of abusive practice the approach to the " Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls; is this permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied well in one way or another, so if it bans something, even the head of the government cannot prevent acting an authority responsible for going to check the law to require compliance," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Commission of Control at the House of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German draft in which the legislation on public procurement of the two countries was compared.
What was the question in concrete?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as for a practice that is specifically referred to it.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and better quality", however, according to some parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to develop more and more detailed rules continuously but that it is necessary to dedicate itself to the implementation of the law.
What can this project help you, and what can it result for you?
Common control of this type should just contribute to what we should stop trying to clarify the laws, lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude all enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by reducing market thresholds, we will not necessarily reach this goal.
It may be that this system is so submerged by the paperasse, that those looking for its flaws will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems relating to the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organization?
As for institutions, like the ISC, there operates the Bundesrechnungshof which is similarly organized, it also has a slightly different council, but these two institutions proceed fundamentally in a similar manner.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance, however, compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, and therefore it also has this kind of accounting courses at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the state resources of us.
Public funds managed by our regions and municipalities are there controlled at the level of the Länder accounts.
Is national legislation simpler than ours?
I would like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designated as a model, but it cannot be said to be better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country we consider as a model is also faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantages to cooperate with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, which has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, are its effects already felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had any impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
Our observations only concern the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for detecting the risks of mismanagement with which we have undergone nearly 14,000 public procurement - that changes will, of course, be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of call procedures and offer suites.
So do you consider the adoption of this law rather than an advantage or an extra burden for administration?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Under the previous regulatory regime, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) forced controlled subjects to accept that any infringement of market law means a lack of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without any consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will bring pressure on the administration.
So what is the way to get out of it?
Let's look where we don't go.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be applied well in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent any authority from acting inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say, "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was.
The market law contains relatively strict rules on formalities to be fulfilled, just to protect the tender call.
But it is also tragic that a tender will be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair, and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen by places, but most remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains mostly practical, in some places with increased vigilance.

In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but by ice and snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5°C and -10°C but should rise slightly in the day.
Snowfalls have stopped in the region and it remains in the plains only a fine layer of snow.
Nevertheless, the hills of the Metal Lift Mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicates that due to the brouillard, visibility was reduced by location.
The R6 fast road and the national roads in the region are now practical without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be placed, for example, on certain bridges whose coating can be frozen and glittered.
All departmental routes and third-class routes, including mountain routes, are also practical.
It still remains on some of their ice-free snow residues and by places tailored by traffic.
Especially in altitude areas, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Direction of Roads and Highways reports on its website that some East Bohemian roads are threatened by the formation of glasses and that snow layers tailored by traffic can be found on roads in mountain areas and in height.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risks of forming glasses in the region of Pardubice in height.
There may be glasses in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, which is mainly on departmental and third-class routes.
The routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been treated chemically.
The snow is mainly located in the Mountains of the Géants (Krkonoše) and the Mountains of l'Aigle (Orlické Hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow tapped by traffic is present on roads in altitude areas.
In East Bohemian, today the weather will be dry, most often freed, with possible cloud passages.
It will breathe a low wind and the temperatures will usually vary between -3° and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practiceable, although, by location, it is necessary to demonstrate increased vigilance and adapt its driving to weather conditions.
It frozen this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3°C and -9°C.
After the latest snowfalls and the cooling that followed, some communication paths can be frozen by places.
Drivers can expect to cross browse areas, however, visibility will gradually improve.
This is what results from information from the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 highway is practical almost without difficulty, however, road communication maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some traps can be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third-class paths are wet and, in this case, warning against frozen troughs is applied.
Drivers must be careful, especially on less frequent roads in the region of Šumava.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers traveling to areas of the Olomouc region in height today must count on a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remains on the neck called "Cervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfalls forced the road maintenance personnel to get to the ground this night; according to the service for the skiing, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most shoes are practicable without difficulty.
"On the heights of the district of Šumperk there are snow residues.
The drivers circulating in direction of Jeseník must expect to meet a thick and soft snow layer in the "Cervenohorské sedlo" necklace ", said ČTK today, the chief of road maintenance services in the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also went on site during the night; according to these latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now freed and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are practical without difficulty, but in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in the forest areas of wet shoes remaining.
Regions of Ústi nad Labem and Liberec
From this morning, North Bohemian road maintenance services have reported several difficult traps.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or glasses, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero and lower height, and therefore snow and glass should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemian, there are no problems, and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at the moment.
The road maintenance services reported the presence of glasses, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for their formation: rain and snowfall during the day, clear sky and ice during the night.
From the main traffic axis, difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec are also reported.
The shutdown of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that curved under the snow weight until the shoe reaches.
Šimon Ornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are more ridiculed and say we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to push or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you will start a totally unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11:00 am in the morning.
The evening, December 20, three concerts will be held simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end when the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, located in the Pacific Ocean, will end on a 12-hour time zone in advance compared to us.
Who had this idea?
Initially I think that was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by purchasing them online at www.e-tap.cz, people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymn against the end of the world entitled "The End of the annulled world " (in Czech "Konec světa  annuleno ").
It’s already very popular on YouTube, can you hear it during these charitable concerts?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be singed simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
The hymns will also join at a given time as part of a completely unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings there too...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We cooperate with other Czech show-biz personalities, due to the fact that we organize numerous charitable concerts and events...
We strive to make them participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it enjoys them.
What will the benefits of these concerts benefit from the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center that is accessible to people with disabilities and of which we have been working to achieve within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest them and enjoy them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will a number of music groups and interpreters be on stage during each of these concerts?
According to what criteria have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will ride on stage Chinaski, Lesbian Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Will you also prepare for other "mega events" like this in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there we will also be sure to prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic’s home in New York, and personally, once on-site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like at the first point.
We have five electric chair members whose engines must travel in the ground, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and instrument boxes.
Until now, more or less all went well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we have come back recently, everything has happened without any problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facility for persons with disabilities, the attitude of public opinion towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What were your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just been witnessed in Moscow than at the east is all still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there is still not common that a person moves alone in an electric chair in the city centre.
They are not yet considered to be a sign of giving priority to a person sitting in an elevator.
Fortunately, there is also being established an association striving to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What do we need to catch up with the most developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with heavy disabilities move alone in public spaces; they can go to toilets, to the museum, anywhere.
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather the opposite of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have amongst us sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back for a few years, what led you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And as I am a musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we have a little lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened over the past few years, if I am not mistaken?
It is true that creating links with well-known singers and working actively on the promotion of the group has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also provide quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Would you like to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy one another.
In some way, it is logical: everything new is acceptable with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I can say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally compassion, it is natural ...
But compassion is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, which we must take in compassion.
They are people who can live a whole life and develop, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something, it is not only an advance for them but for the whole society.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand a certain discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come home with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they realize they have to come to repetitions twice a week, follow preparation courses and spend a lot of time on the concert routes, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
A single, Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and leave, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wish to join us.
This will be the case for the scheduled day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21:00 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relais when jointly singing the song of The Tap Tap Group "The End of the World cancelled " .
The aim of the concert is to collect funding (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training center located in Prague at Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket selling is open to Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as twenty-three member of the Agency, it is the second Member State of the former East Block (the Czech Republic has become fully member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had initiated close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed participated in a number of agency projects.
However, the road to space from Poland began much earlier.
Before World War II, passionate Polish were working on space flights; they did not always meet understanding.
I would like to talk about, for example, the A. Šternfeld conference at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his " Introduction to Astronautism " book.
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold auditors and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie award and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to Astronaut".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major spreader of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many works dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a worldwide-famous astronaut propagator, his contribution was awarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon.
Since 1925, a drive was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the missile should be used to drive or brake the drive.
The only information known about this draining is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to the missiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
Conserved documents show that this research had reached the stage of the tests.
Of course, with the arrival of the German army, the research stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting missile, drawn by Rohoziński engineer, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda airna i raketobomba avionicza" was published by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
The two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for use of the fuse technique were conducted by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work dedicated to the airline were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronaut company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is about a company in the November 1954 issue magazine, in which four more detailed articles about aviation.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronomy.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had the future.
In the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronaut Federation (created in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronaut Federation.
He maintained his office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the successful development of the RM Meteorologiczna (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has become the first Polish missile to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-metre missile was 80 cm long and weighed slightly less than 5 kg.
An improved version was later built, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959 two-storey RM-2 missile flight tests were launched in the Bledov desert.
This missile was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific works - the RM-34 missile should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development works were stopped.
The Meteor-1 missile developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type missiles.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (so-called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A missile had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B the volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C was 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of engines was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missiles were deployed at the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in the space exploration of artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of the program.
The abolition of the law on public utility works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public utility works.
This decision raised a strong discussion in the public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to consider this issue from a broader point of view.
The liberalism-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This concretely means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free movement (free limits) of private capital associated with a substantial financial speculation.
The significant differences in labour price (wages) generate a price tension.
A producer is committed to importing low-cost goods to resist economic competition by " making the price of the competitor " more expensive, in order to remove a greater part of the market and thus increase its own profits.
In a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy at low prices, or disappear. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility and therefore is the same responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burden of the State is necessarily increasing.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect bad will of the gentlemen to pay entrepreneurs taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole society by this race for profit.
This situation is so popular that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data.
Practice without scrupulous private capital causes in different economies a situation in which governments of different countries are forced to start in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital at home.
In other words, governments give their own population thanks to private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly manifested in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to force its own population economically to accept the dictatorship of private capital prices, particularly in the field of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been for many years public food distribution points for poor people who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement to reach the vital minimum.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliary in the federal parliament.
Almost all EU Member States of the South have, without doubt, generated a similar situation in which, under pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to immigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with their private capital wages invested in the day of misery, and a country of hope, in society.
Here is the question: Where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will be transferred from one country to another; this capital may not come either from a Chinese, a Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, a Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim, in fact, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital advocates the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not lead, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the entire state.
The answer to this question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby that is present in all states.
This results in a desperate situation in the field of corruption, by giving mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the RFA, the situation is so, that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delay the draft laws to lawyers firms closely related to the industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitutions of Western kind declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalism-oriented democracies are now quickly faced with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompea": "The State has long been in full delicacy and the functions were attributed to violence.
The pots of wine, the illegally obtained favors, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The undertables and corruption prolifered without limits and the people went to elections with already sold voices"... "The honest people did not seek to gain functions at all, it resulted once the state had remained 8 months without consulates."... 'The absolute democratic life that was transformed by the regime, but the absolute life began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was actually a fallicial life.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without any means for the benefit of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and make the interests of society as a whole.
This resulted, as before, in today's case, in a decline without prior elites, without any effort to carry out deep reforms.
Therefore, we must look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the liberalization without scrupulous economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of things, the disappearance of these systems in favor of liberal democracies can be considered as a kind of pause before a new step.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises of which we are witnesses today, as well as crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repealing of the law on public utility works is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and at European internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue searching for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is in fact systemic.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able to,” Sting in the song entitled Fragile, whose main verse of refrain is “let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons wouldn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be any,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her death bed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the Israeli party, arguing its right to self-defense and putting Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine, and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about the question of knowing who is guilty and who is victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; totally, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view of "the rear of the curtain", on the one to whom they mostly benefit from the tensions that have lasted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available in the study, others come from my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is, above all, the history of a struggle for power.
At every time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owe their acts to the throne to someone who managed their acts according to pre-defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers has not been able to do during one generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished by the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the pigeon (I don’t know if these families still have a leader but I don’t exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Oh, of course.
Since the nineteenth century, they have acquired the first global press agency (Reuters) to end the ties between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were mixed and which have always been marked for them to strengthen their power, to increase their wealth or both.
They have major participations in nearly most central banks in the world and prepare or conduct wars against countries in which they have not yet had such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of the central Iraqi invasion of 5, after the invasion of the Kadhafi ban only under the Russian government.
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of central bank to the Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue his own money (governmental, I hear well) and was killed in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began emitting own money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was murdered in 1963, Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the FED for having triggered the big economic crisis of 1929.
Their global power thirst led in 1859 to 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33th-degree franc-mason, which was the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate the great state monarchys of Europe, the second had to eliminate colonialism, including the British, and the third had to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (a lot of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (ecumenism, which is nothing but such a solution, but a final solution.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their head the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and are still leading to a worsening situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeated crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After successfully launching the First World War by the murder of Sarajevo de Ferdinand, heir of Habsburg to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War was suddenly ended by a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsaristic Russia) and followed by the destruction of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For a lighter start of World War II, bankers allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they have imposed to Germany of far-repair war repairs that thus generated the conditions of a radicalization of the masses of the craftsmanships (that is, it is necessary for them to then have a German simple role to put a sufficiently energetic leader, and they demonstrate a realistic solution.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the historic Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the foundations of a massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War collapsed; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers initially held it; or if everything he did was planned, however, the fact that the sufferings of Europe’s Jews in concentration camps created the foundations of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the global community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as war repairs imposed on Germany were the origin of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel was a firehouse that could cause a Third World War.
If international bankers manage to start this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during World War II, the first victim of fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discomfort and chaos, not only in this country, but also internationally (just to see how people are divided between Israeli supporters and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a mistake generates another error according to an endless circle of violence, and where, at the beginning of all, some individuals’ cupidity and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
It is necessary to make a difference here between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as at home, international bankers offer people to the election only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascising politicians, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to launch a war with Iran, which could, due to the membership of this country to the global cooperation organization of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, etc.) to expand to the broader 20% of the economy of the world, which is the only way of becoming a global conflict and, since the
Under what light appears David Rockefeller’s speeches in 1994: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrates of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth by an electronic puppy making it a totally controlled being.
"Let all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, carry on their hand or on their fronts a red iron mark, so that they can neither buy nor sell anyone who does not carry the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
It is necessary to understand that the person who has a good sense counts the numbers of this foolish beast.
This number is the man, and it is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: When everything goes worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamic students attacked the U.S. Embassy of Tehran and detained 52 diplomats.
They had to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for decades.
The situation would not offer positive consequences to the U.S. administration, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would severely break down the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the liberation of captives.
It was a hard hit for the US prestige, a hit further aggravated by the fiasco attempt to release the captives by force.
The seized diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the Algerian government's negotiations.
Their fate triggers a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iran feeling in the United States.
The Iranian debtor contributed strongly to Jimmy Carter’s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story offering a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated incidents, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tournament team coming to make surveys for filming a large-scale science fiction film.
Combination of genres
Tony Mendez’s exfiltration expert’s plan requires Hollywood’s collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores stated this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, and the film was based on Tony Mendez’s memories.
The Affleck film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful hit, a traitor - such as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven trilogy, twelve and thirteen.
The environment follows: The Tehran sequences of documentary style (in the subtitles are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, the same situations have been retranslated in the film, there are no major differences),
lighter passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of excess,
and then scenes of the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costume men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone.
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career remarkably.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected scener and his game as an actor ceased to excite ironic observations.
Argo is his third long film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first film that does not take place in his original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where Tehran’s role is “managed” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, when reconstructing real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy’s fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when, in a certain place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his employees get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the fake touring team in the Bazar of Tehran).
Too many actions in too many places
The filmmaker had to satisfy a subject that in fact offers only a few exciting scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It goes very well, sometimes it adds some elements to reality, and there the result is not always so elegant (the scene where the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a phone hit in America and the continuation on the landing track is quite tired of hair).
Argo’s weakness resides in its dissipated nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are absolutely charming in their role as Hollywood co-workers, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and that are not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck’s film is missing a bit of dramatic tension, it is left to see with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story again, in some way, unfinished until now, and as an illustration of the excessive character of the representation of secret services as all-powerful and all-knowledge, he does the case.
Rules to sweat balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts a public inquiry every year on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to launch the competition of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd EU workshop.
"The fact that the EU has recently planned to adopt a 40 percent women's quota for the leadership of major European companies has been the origin of our decision," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the investigation.
One of the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unite insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women were advantageous for life insurance rates because they, objectively, represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report any other incredible idea of the "EU workshop" by the end of the year.
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio components to fuel, which has harmful environmental consequences, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of dangerous substance increase or the directive on the size of chickens, which has caused the price of chickens.
In the past, criticisms have also been issued against the prohibition of using the term "tartinary butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of classical ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (as the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups, for example, are also the origin of the fact that bananas should not be less than 14 cm in the Union or have an abnormal curve.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonised non-harmony national standards that complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been sophisticated despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to a waste of food.
The first prize can be awarded in this investigation to the last year’s EU regulation that must include a warning on inflatable balloons indicating that children under 8 years of age should not sweat without adult surveillance.
The EU has referred to an American investigation that balloons are amongst the toys the first cause of child deaths by stomach.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age for breathing in fairy trumpets.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rule relating to European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, anyone who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Association "Leave Do" grouping liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in addition to some absurdities mentioned above, appointed the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves available in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the quantities fixed for preserved mushrooms and risked, therefore, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey considered interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of granting subsidies to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not originating from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we have no sea is disabled.
We will ask the European Union for a refund." In autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, due to our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized an invitation for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for obtaining grants were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which, in particular, had to serve in the drafting of subsidies granted by Brussels.
The EU says: “Old regulations are rare.”
While the regulations often criticize the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union functioning as well as in the field of its overall development deserve praise.
For example, according to experts, the issue of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration but which have been imposed by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, struggles in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fighting of which it is not always a winner) causes vibrant emotions in the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for the name "Tuzemský rum" that comes back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar-based alcohol products, and not beef-based sugar, can be called rhum.
In the official list of EU registered products, today you can find in a globally known cheese company such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's mass paint or Parme's jam, Karlovy Vary's biscuits ("Karlovarské sugarary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň's carpes ("Pohorelický lemelický et Třeboň").
Pardubice's epice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice Cornets" ("hořické tubečky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how is the idea of presenting itself in the presidential elections?
It's not to be a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked without any problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been pilled in the last twenty years, that the thieves are not under the ropes and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to bring a solution to change it.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present myself in presidential or senatorial elections.
You have entered the Senate but you have quickly moved to the Château (N.d.T.: Chairmanship).
Don’t you turn your back to those who have chosen you?
I’ve always said I’ll start in the battle for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I stated that if I were elected Senator, I would present myself in the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as long as we are laughing at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we are laughing at those who are trying to make change.
This adds the press that breaks people’s reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, we have stated to me that I am ashamed of journalists or I have been Jiří Paroubek's adviser.
Let's come to your visions.
You have started the struggle for the Castle with as a battle horse the themes of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements over twenty million [CZK].
You have to change the law for this purpose.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I have put pressure on the tourism guide activities as a liberal profession, I have gained cause.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from left or right with a good project, this one is deliberately rejected and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I have much more chances of obtaining support from all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and supportive dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Are you regarded as a man of right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people place me more on the left.
Whether it’s a little left or right, it’s not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we should go ahead.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but to gather people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act as impartially against bad ideas.
Are you crying when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But what you said isn't proof of it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have an optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of the parliament, there are only slogans for you.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and the public opinion and try to rally them at my camp to impose it.
If I had been elected president, it wouldn't be a problem to retransmit live to TV my request to parliamentary parties presidents to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they don’t want it.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the presidential election for direct suffrage, it was obtained by pressure of the public opinion.
I am arrogant, no ambassadors, to be an amateur, not an intellectual engineer.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just started in politics and I try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to make things progress alone, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and I'll come back to the private sector.
It’s like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can’t make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves in the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed fraud in the mazeum.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy, but now I am excited.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did mostly gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, the direct suffrage of Mayors and Prefects of Regions.
Are you planning to create your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to verify whether the past of each potential member is intact and then I don't have financial resources.
I don’t have any money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal assets at about 60 million.
I have a field of 25 million in Prague, an apartment of ten million, an apartment of eight million, an art collection of about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
I have a Aston Martin because it was a boy's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was riding in a car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You roll in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I borrow?
I have already invested 2 million and a half in the country.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows well that my program does not raise a great interest.
I don't have to pay this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as Senator.
But I couldn’t live in it, for example, paying my son’s English school that costs 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to make money, I will not present myself at any election.
Are you going to continue your business to live?
Didn’t you say that you’d put your activities in a dirt?
But this does not relate to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
However, I have to live in something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I win and continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that true adventures are not just an imagination business. To convince them, just consider Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
“I find that this building is funny, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” said Lisette Verhaig, a walker on the street’s bottom coast.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighbouring company, says, "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is going to be full of his will in one of these ringhard libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a town-dortoir that has nothing to attract at the gates of Rotterdam, has a fairly special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to return some neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small, armed concrete miniatures.
The success of the cultural offensive remains limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get the hand back on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV Architects Office, master of diagrams in brave buckets and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynics, accepted the project with his usual flavour and presented himself in the contest in 2003 with five books under the arm and a face-to-face riding.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at themselves, disturbed and lifting their shoulders, Maas, the faced, empilated his choice books in order to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech with activist arguments by one: "Community dear!"
Here is my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or, as it is said, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain landed.
The building is included in a revitalization project including a ground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few mitoyan buildings and houses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
That is how this small town, which has so far had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian area and a municipality of a charming leather, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a milk, has been enriched with contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in her history.
The long way to reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under cheese cloak.
Of course, an elevator brings you to the heart of the mass, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you blow the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The entire glass-made interior is bright and clear, the Dutch brick soil and elegant reverbs speak the language of municipal public squares without equation.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public banks, dogs and little boys and girls playing the ball.
And everywhere books, books, and more books.
“Usually, library rays are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and unpersonalized,” says Willy Maas.
We completely shattered the classic space configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the book mountain was arranged in the middle of the offices, the Internet library, the club of cheques, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambs, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stairs ramps.
A new experience for viewing, touching and smelling.
Even the architects and engineers of the hard building do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse municipality, in a response to Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a frison farm.
In the Netherlands, a millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It’s cheap and you’re earning time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons and then can be thrown out.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogenous and resistant material, whose smell evokes a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers us an impressive view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
The latter creates an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is an ecological model project,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermality.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass cloak, the sun only lights the inner time, even the days of good weather.
The thick wooden bubbles rising through compared to the glass facade serve as a sunshine, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very nice.
Fully automated stores are charged by the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic informatician, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally found soul."
In fact, a few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to give a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the empty library that was not yet completely garnished (now it counts 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
According to architect Winy Maas, "There is nothing worse than a half empty library."
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV achieved the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, the creation of an identity.
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if she may seem young and unfamiliar.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose the abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinians to obtain observer status from the United Nations.
But she then chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree with what Israel did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious because it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, however, without being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention during the vote on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have difficulty adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to get away from a policy defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are struggling on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still trying to find this role, but they're on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy then mean for the Germans?
It demonstrates its willingness to adopt independent positions from the United States and European partners, including in national cases.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position towards the Middle East conflict and the abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has significant markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
Therefore, Berlin must be careful not to strike the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is certainly a decisive element.
However, I would not give it too much importance, because it is not a single-sided relationship.
But this is, in any case, a decisive element in German strategic thoughts.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention during important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That's why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Are opinions different between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the U.S. internal political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly demonstrates a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I think the real differences in opinions are not so big that they always look like it.
If you observe the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far beyond enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Does Germany have difficulty reconciliating its close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot, therefore, register within a broader political line and must affirm their single position.
That is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will take a role as a locomotive in the future and will force Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they have to play a role that marks their independence more.
Does Germany play a role as a weight actor on the international stage, is Germany just wanting to take a key role?
Or does it still have difficulties to take top roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable for him and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties to play a more important role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, this is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only reduces, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, so what remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, a institute in which universities and policy experts in Europe and North America together analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Marke Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really?
Behind this name is a brand officially deposited in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand therefore enjoys such protection as the company that bears its name cannot make a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause.
“It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in breach of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
Imitators only need additional letters to be able to record their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also copied legally, such as Puma, the sporting product manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a classroom in which the records made at the Beijing Brands Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and breach of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are shopping malls on several floors that sell virtually only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: its officials are responsible for tackling the fact that the Chinese brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parental brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
With this term, women are designated to marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to complain.
“It’s bad for business, we need to fight this trend,” Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweet, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
Financial losses and justice expenses are millions for the sectors concerned, particularly with regard to expensive lighting products.
According to the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of €15 billion, the third world market of luxury products and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to radiate the doubtful records of the trademark register and these procedures cost expensive.
These last can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never sure.
Pattloch reports the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the criticised name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant has no luck, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiar, because he would harm his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against Sany, the same company that just bought Putzmeister concrete pump manufacturer.
That’s why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo acquirer, used beforehand a blue and white logo that reminded BMW’s. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against Hong Kong and Singapore plagiarians who had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits had suffered some difficulties in 2010 due to lack of staff and space.
However, last year the office would have passed a "urgencies in the course of work to a normally recovered".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures are still suffering at the office.
Action is expensive
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand deposit applications, almost one-third of more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record, and that means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office had accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrates the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiar.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault because family names cannot be protected in Germany,” said Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities at Munich.
The brand office had therefore rejected the objection of Munichois.
Freudenberg has certainly gained cause from the following two instances, but the opponent continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is putting
Today, the case is in court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive issue of the trial and honors the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, proven, and it costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the archive service has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed to the opponent in vain a "six-digit euro large sum" to resolve the dispute.
“That is what we see what this means for us,” Wentzler trusts.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to cross Europe.
This would be the case if the imitators of this region would ensure the use of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had for a long time abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Watching is the placement."
Pattloch and German companies are advised to show great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to trust in international trademark law, but foreigners should rather “register all that is likely to be protected in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of registration.
If Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the opponent for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or then, we will lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
World Anti-Aids Day: Swimming, Singing, Helping
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice over their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we take the foot: cowboy boots, baskets, scarfs for ladies and mocassins for men seek the rhythm by striking the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly enlarged - alto, low, tenor, and soprano - they overcome, invoke and follow one another.
Fiete Hopf, 29-year-old orchestra leader, almost loses his shelf shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, Imbongi choral repeats a new song in the music room at the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came from genetics in human medicine to man to home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every chorist has different words, everything in a very exotic language: the zulou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are suffering from disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is seropositive.
180 orphans of the village of Esitjeni AIDS found parents in Germany thanks to the association Voices for Africa.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros for less, you can become parrain.
This amount guarantees to the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily warm meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zulou "history teller" or "loud singer".
No one can usually speak the bantou language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the chorale has repeated songs in this foreign language that she brought to Germany to bring it back to her homeland: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometers flying from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40% of people with disabilities
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest pail or land huts, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, on a smaller scale, we can observe the diseases that affect Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that, however, guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is carrying the immune deficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of the thirty.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring 2005, the choral had been able to discover the village. The Imbongians mostly saw many children in the streets where it was missing not only parental care, but also simply all: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is absolutely no prospect.
At the beginning, it was only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year to be able to send a child to school and offer him a warm meal daily.
But just a year later, the chorale founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been almost professionally occupied with Esitjeni’s orphanage AIDS.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial ISTs are syphilis, chlamydias and blennorragia (or gonorrhea).
Common ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The pubis and gals belong to the parasite IST.
What are the groups mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorragia often occur in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sex between men is the origin of at least four cases of syphilis in five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, infections associated with chlamydia, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), blennorragia and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread rate of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European reports, three-quarters of all infections relate to young people aged between 15 and 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the number has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of a tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abcess at the level of genital organs, urinary pain, white losses, lower-ventry pain as well as the appearance of buttons and verrues.
However, they regularly do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of infection, but do not protect to 100%.
The reason is that pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricant infection or by narrow body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sexual partners regularly undertake examinations.
Most rapidly detected ISTs can be healed and late sequence can be avoided.
Thanks to parrainages, donations, but especially the funds that the chorists gather through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well lodged at one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, so called the old women in Zulou, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, they offer a roof and make sure they go to school every day at the time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two kitcheners who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a cowboy school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the concourse of the U.S. Health Organization PSI, the association organized a HIV test for many residents.
This does not matter itself, because even if the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and his 14 Wives
“Aids is a true taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it is a subject that affects sexuality.”
It's quite curious, coming from a country the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarchy of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamia instead of democracy.
These morals sanctioned by the State are, among other things, responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, there are preservatives in every corner of the street, says Annette Lennartz, “but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, meat against meat."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years to South Africa and excited the nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people from the top of the black continent still know the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also pulls out tears to some scary border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the hikers visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of Ezulweni.
“Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there,” people there say.
And after a 8,733 kilometers of bird flight, returning to Heidelberg, in front of those hikers who touch the foot in the Bergheimer Straße repetitive room, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thickness.
The U.S. Space Agency NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercure.
Although this planet is closest to the sun, it closes frozen water, as explained three studies published Thursday in the Science magazine.
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice coverage in the region of the planet constantly flooded in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that could reach up to 20 meters.
The water is likely from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercure.
However, no one is linked between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, the scientist head of the Messenger sondage, Sean Solomon, explains.
The temperature on Mercure can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unperceived inhabitants of our planet, sondages, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the naine planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, orbiting around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink spots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-borns" in the universe’s birthroom.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this area where the stars are born, called "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope photographed the flaming brightness of a star dying.
The bending-shaped circle is composed of elements the star projected when she dies.
In the immense nebulous Trifide, at 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birth room.
Pléiades, star masses also called "the seven sisters", can be observed at the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope highlights more colors.
On this infrared photo, Helice’s nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the spectator.
It is 700 light-years-old in the constellation of Verseau.
His similarities with a land continent valued him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest enigmes of astronomy is the creation of Saturn’s rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the greatest and finest photographs ever taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real art works.
The photography published by the South European Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divised, divided into three), because three dust strings divide the lush heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the primes of a cosmic crash in the constellation of the Serpent: at 400 million light-years of Earth, the nucleus of two galaxies in fusion climb to each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spirale galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its surname "Australia Fire Rail".
The picture of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Irish nebula in the constellation of Cephae.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years-old and is composed of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common domestic dust.
This photo was created from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle composed of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our milk path.
The sky sky always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also permanently create young stars to 5,000 light-years of the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced with a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe he was born shortly after bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see more and more far away in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope of the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, on the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror only reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, limiting mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle level.
Its particularity holds its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity approaches those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) by contributing to the calculation power of the machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), an installation worth its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also intended for the ESO website in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés before 2018 at the latest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are residential.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 planets candidates since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb space telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the latest in 2018 on a Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will have a mission to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the Southern Pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
The radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercure for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger sondage in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the confidence of it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is also a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is also a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is a romantic moment.
Around the many tours of the road, the small bus cakes along forested hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, about which we do not know much, is that they speak Persian and Azerbaijan perfectly and have a very long life.
Term: Lerik.
The small town climbs with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree with the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is very painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road has only one road.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
Nevertheless, 48-year-old Pilatea Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the eldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum like this in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozens of Talysh in the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture of black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Have another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no act of birth.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he would still have conceived a daughter.
Will Shirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a geronologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man in the age of Central Asia.
"At surprisingly elderly people also live in some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "in Sardinia, there are also men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, without regard to the fact that there was no registry of civil status.
Every day, a glass of fooled butter
However, it is in fact that people in the region of Lerik often reach a decent age of the Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, Azerbaijan tourist guide, explains that the Talyshs have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, from a nutritional point of view it does not seem plausible that calorie-rich meals of Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and whose many drink daily a glass of frozen butter, are good for health.
Or is this the simple lifestyle that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a small village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the floor next to a rack, of which it hits the content inadvertently.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little children also play in the house.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for guests serving in typical belly-shaped armada glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his foulard hide from long trees of a dark blonde that his son reveals to us with pride.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and so I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," Mirzayeva added.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small potatoes.
For my whole life, I have never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she talked to us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda is amazed in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the patriarchal figure of the nation, a man who, however, led his country as a dictator, almost knew no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham succeeded him later.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good living train in the region.
And maybe Mirzayeva’s long grey son has been right: “The elderly enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" missed in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The charia-based constitutional project is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not ashamed of words full of emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility for the people and God,” he said.
His speech was dedicated to the whole people, but also especially to the Christian Cops, to the liberals, to the enlightened and laic Muslims.
Because all members of the opposition are confused and desperately dismissed are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, by almost excuse, to temporarily restrict the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand its "to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, who has a doctoral degree at the American University of Southern California.
Will the judicial power be overthrown?
The 234 articles, which were promptly written by the majority Islamic assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force tour, are actually to some extent alarming.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and this remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the wave formulation and the margin of legal maneuver resulting from it to apply a more strict interpretation of charia.
In any case, it gives you a newly introduced article that, as regards all the subjects of charia, the al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiant brilliance on all Sunni Islamic people.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto lead to the introduction of judicial power.
Several aspects of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of the military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts used to repress the opponents.
After the dictator’s fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, can be read in the project, protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morality and values”.
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions can even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would be just censorship.
In addition, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article is prohibited from offending or spreading the prophet Mahomet or his messengers.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Also doubtful is the formulation that lets you hear that it is forbidden to "offense people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the President or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
There are therefore many issues to be interpreted in the draft which Morsi will submit to the vote and which, according to his own words, will be "very soon" subject to a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Renaissance"
The opposition has been mobilising for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on the Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to make the charia fall before it enters into force.
"The revolution rebirths and we're going to win," Hamdin Sabbahi lanced, arriving third in presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to throw into the poultry of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to promote a “putsch against democracy”.
"If he announces the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will turn him back," Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated,” said Khaled Ali, a political man and opposition member of the Egyptian media.
In addition, many judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
On the other hand, well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on the Tahrir place as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
The widows and the supporters of the salafists, who participated in many of them, scanned "the people demanding the application of the law of God."
"Net our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an was their Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir place, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Of course, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that opponents of the draft Constitution, in the same way as their supporters, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the urnes of the direction that the country must take.
The project of Islamists will certainly win the majority.
"The human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with the imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and integrated all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Moubarak.
He did it not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him the human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was wrapped, judged and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regretted during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers denied the lawyer.
These measures are screaming violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto removes all his powers," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels delayed, including by the international community, looking at the battle between the various political ideologies on the Nile side with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid.
A demonstrator at Tharir’s place warns: “You are born of a monster that you will no longer be able to control.”
Norway’s rack fish: is it the world’s most fragrant fish?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely smellful fish?
Take advanced cheese.
Place them in the middle of a piece of wet and dirty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most precious foods in Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this, omnipresent, smells the air.
The rakfisk consists of sauced salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can last up to a year.
When the dark is installed and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in a mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
“You eat crude, and then you’ll eat a glass of water,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter, also called “Rakfisk General”, responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people smell small pieces of fish and fill a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit for rack fish,” Havard added.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it is not bad - it makes it think of a sushi that would have spent many hours in a bus.
The rakfisk returns to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in thin water barriques in the air, and then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish was removed and - without any doubt with the emoind senses by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full-employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so long richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, although smellful, element of the past of Norway.
This makes use of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer pen or sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not for him to displease.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Andres Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they evoke this murder, they talk about the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country, one of them has been able to commit such a barbarian act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has debted its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the world’s most important.
“But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success,” explains Anna, our servant, to the blonde hair and in the eyes of a transpicious blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a handful of rakfisk plate.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people living here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we don’t like to make ourselves notice.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with much caution - everything, with the exception of a low percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows over the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway knew to keep the belts of its stock exchange well closed.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and make a hike in the summer, we are happy,” Anna said.
"We can't forget the rack," she adds in a smile.
I stand under the snow and I make the curve to buy what to eat - I had my dosage of rakfisk.
In the menu, a hamburger composed of elan, a real discovery, it's great.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where rakfisk is used for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV broadcast where the presenter wears a node-paper, surrounded by rakfisk chairs.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish, in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughs and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of aquatic abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult departure.
While President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take his roles in Mexico, the BBC’s Will Grant is interested in the difficulties that await him and the people’s expectations that are many.
The road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where bulbs are legionary in normal time, a security bar has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential embrace to become the new president in the head of the nation.
A complicated task waiting for it.
The Mexican economy goes well, the results that the president Felipe Calderon owes, but the country is in danger of a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has taken its commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very popular and tentacular state that encloses the capital. In its preferred land, the opinions about this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is recorded in the memory of all.
The locals assign it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To join the city, you can take one of the new highways of M. Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bossed and full of crews.
Its name covers plates outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to make sustainable changes," said his friend and political allie Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In particular, in terms of security and economics, we expect a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without power, the PRI was erased in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the president palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the criticism of opponents who rejected the new president’s lack of charism.
He is a whole man, very engaged, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent state man and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the highway bridges, it constitutes, in many ways, an area of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, soldiers were called to rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a displaced area, the bodies of dozens of women have been killed in the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly known place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that best, he has failed to distort the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
The worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality face to face.
In a concrete house, typical of this decayed neighbourhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to keep her tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came home, he seemed to me that his body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the body rigidity had already been amortized.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word is: Justice.
But that’s exactly what the family refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old committer, a disturbance, a crying.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and negligence," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives its sharpness on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the last six years and the new president has promised that he would prioritize it during his mandate.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," Olvera said at Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that’s exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of wrong treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning would have been victim during the detention.
The trial involves Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to classify the case for the reason that Manning's sequestration has been done under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Attorneys attempted on Friday to demonstrate that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the greatest escape of confidential information throughout the history of the U.S. army -- missed many occasions to complain about the misconducts he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
In a counter-interrogation with Manning during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney May, Ashden Fein claimed that weekly visit records made by officials during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, have not disclosed any complaints about his treatment.
The counter-inquiry -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request that Manning case be classified for the fact that the seizure was made under very difficult conditions and was a fairly severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning witnessed his desire to suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
In the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico’s military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and gave his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment he reserved his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaint about misconduct, although officers have directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had spoken orally about concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said they would deal with it, but they did not mention the issues mentioned.
“They wrote “no problem” (after addressing concerns), and yet that didn’t mean that I hadn’t raised problems,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained of his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the Special Committee that had met to discuss the suicide thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to make his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned this restrictive status to him -- a level below close surveillance for the risk of suicide -- for his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted that this status was removed... to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison of the base of the Marine Corps to Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had planned to kill himself when he was in Kuwait and had escaped once because of heat.
He added that the fact that he was not aware of what would happen to him or what would happen to him in the rest of the world was very anxious.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent his most clear time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothes, and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or staying extended during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also stated that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned at night, they awakened him so that they could see his face.
Manning’s attorney lodged a formal complaint for Manning’s trials in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
The judge also asked Manning questions about an allegation reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners one morning during the appeal.
Manning witnessed that at no time, he was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deleted the order of his guard that he had to release his cover that could have hid his nakedness, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tongs to injure himself, but he hadn't done it.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had experienced during his imprisonment and that he will considerably reduce his sentence if he was to be recognized guilty in a court of war, a trial that should be held at the beginning of next year.
The defence said Manning plans to blame for the least serious crimes and fight for the resignation of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should be resumed this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulation governing the conditions for detention of all detained at Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collapse with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the charges are kept, it encourages criminal jail forever.
Mexican-American identity crisis
He said many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who are left; they remind Mexicans of the difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two paths: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Extrangers").
I stayed immobile for a few seconds, not knowing what kind of direction I was going to.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualification, the same title as what my friends in Boston use when they say “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they say “Italian”.
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And on the earth that my grandfather has been born, there is no need for special qualification or union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to manage an interview in one or another language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed to the Strangers line.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, the White House.
Usually, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preference issues are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans are forced to stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although it did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of anxiety.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory to the top of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think for centuries, and not for minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an U.S. official formulates the least criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are offending the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And Montezuma's children are looking for the crash.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country is dealing with more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to address the subject of anxiety?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, has found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type profile -- a dark, uninstructed skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and have good situations, we should never lose sight that this is the American dream we are living, not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
In addition, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the leading class does not love us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they make us feel as if we were individuals of lower root and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have gone.
And we would not find ourselves caught on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who was legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexicans are contrary to it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexico-Americans I know do not feel like being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also the music of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate a little bit more the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligences want to approach the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country that absolutely needs to be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much anger.
And if we consider the inequality of wages, corruption and violence related to drugs that are all present, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to deal with yourself, friends.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are still not willing to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexicans a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want to treat them in the way their family members have been treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old disputes, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a sustainable peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow seems to indicate that such a hope is empty.
While the same foolish arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were cut into dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, missiles pulled from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the city of Jerusalem, and the holy city of Israel.
But although Israeli and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full mutation.
The Arab Spring has made everything stealing, and whether it is desired or not, Palestinians and Israelis are captured by this regional crash.
Perhaps their struggle will be a little more intensified.
However, there are all reasons to think that this could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A War that doesn’t make any losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Even if the ceasefire granted on November 21 continues, the battles of this week have strengthened the supporters of the force on both sides.
Hamas’ leaders, the Islamic movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has issued a rash.
Having killed some of his leaders and refouled the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overwhelmed corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas gains land on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the other moderate Palestinian factions.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their allies.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a full-growing regional power, once the closest Muslim ally in Israel, has made and has caused for Hamas; as well as Qatar, one of the richest and dynamicest states in the Gulf.
The members of the Hamas rejoicing and saying that the growing Islamist runs around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominion, through Syria, where Islamic-tendant rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of Muslim Brotherhoods under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far from the most populated and central Arab countries, has changed the region’s balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the depot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the contrary, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas’ cousins, and their leaders are more easier to return to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been resettled in box.
The Iron Dome missile arrest system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its inadequate support; and many European countries have opposed Hamas to be the origin of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza’s missile shootings have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been saved by suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that empires the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the international law of Jewish colonies who continue to extend it.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party fusioned with a even more bellicist party, the one of leader Avigdor Lieberman approaching the election of January 22, has the beautiful party.
Why doll these Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were driving the West Bank, wouldn't they throw rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their heads.
The supporters of the line may have to win it; but the Arab Spring may change it.
Even if the Muslims who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments organize their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get an interruption of the fire what's good -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israeli people should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is dedicated to exploding one day in Israel’s occupied territories – a little like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to summit Hamas will be awarded diplomatically.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains the pronounced by the reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this journal: two states, with a cesion of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now needs to expect to end the movement of weapons to Gaza, in the same way as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from foreign countries should also press Hamas and Fatah to join them.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo-state to the United Nations.
Obama is also interested in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back to the White House, it seems like a reticence to establish one.
It's a very exhausted vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packages enter into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is the first world, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and terrible pictures of sick organs and the representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging diet in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to dissuade young people from smoking by suppressing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people haven’t started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% of chances that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message that tobacco manufacturers have revealed through their brand image,” said the federal health minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that, for example, revealed that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess.”
Even though Australia records the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on multinational profits, other countries are considering a similar approach.
Tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would reinstate black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"Negative consequences will result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia will sell more fake cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had dynamicized their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said the demand for cigarettes, particularly silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has increased significantly two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco contested the law and lost before the Australian High Court.
He said Zico sold 6,000 to retailers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, businesses are good.
The only annoying thing, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the targeted population rate.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsoring and the obligation for retailers to dissimulate cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and have only a small glass to promote your products, the Internet is the inevitable place of excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in certain Lambda citizens’ contributions to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We should ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been worth making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focused on the new regulation in force rather than marketing.
The industry went up to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new judicial decisions - these countries stated to the WTO that trade is unjustly dissatisfied, although none of these countries had significant trades with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had discussed similar packaging laws with other countries.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you store the package," Victor El Hage said when he bought a package on which a photo of a tumor from the mouth is shown.
To be honest, the only reason that makes me stop is my little daughter.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack of Tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said the uniformity of the packaging would make it difficult to store packages on the floors.
"In advance, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it took me four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them a good time for all, and we would have said OK, well, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, lifting his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the topic of annoying.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spend a half-day in an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child are praised by annoying.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to bore themselves from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting paths, or even feed creativity.
And as most of us are constantly faced with several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of annoying.
So should we welcome the boring in open arms?
Yeah, yeah.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that annoying was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffitis that evoke annoyment, they return to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boring.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a group professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After visiting many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the annoyance as an experience that consists of "to want to do something but not to be able to start in a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the annoyingness of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though he would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What's in the heart of boringness, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a boring mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing."
Boringness can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while people who are depressed think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we're boring while it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an older experience in which participants were listening to the voice of a person reading a magazine.
Some groups heard, from the room next to, the sound too high of a TV broadcast which had no reporting, others just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group did not understand the sound band at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low noise level said they were more annoying than the other two groups - they had difficulty focusing, but did not know why, and attributed this focus problem to annoying.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or overwhelming task, an interruption of attention can lead to annoying, said Mark J. Fenske, a grouped neuroscience professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the contrary, when you perform a boring task, "as watching objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not bore yourself."
In fact, he says, now we know that when mistaken or griffon, these gestures, often regarded as signs of boringness, are in fact a good way to remain more physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigo learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay without moving,” Professor Fenske said.
We all bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocorded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to bore than others.
In order to measure this, researchers developed a "Challe of Predisposition to Boring" in the 1980s.
The scale includes assertions such as, "Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do anything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to bore themselves more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasphemed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He said that 32 percent of teenagers would decline to get bored at school and during their home duties, while 23 percent would decline to get bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if today’s boring percentages, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "teenager is a period where annoying reaches its highest level", particularly because children and adolescents don't have much control of what they want to do.
If I ask you: Is the boring thing good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, betting or abuse of certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the contrary, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between annoying and creativity, Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“The annoyment is the way the brain has found to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is boring and you give him an iPad, he will no longer bore, but he will not learn to take care of himself alone or self-regulating, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation moves from one situation to another," he says.
Your child learns not only how to have fun, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boringness.
Like I do not think we should criticize it.
Feel comfortable outside of the constant boiling which generates activities and technology is the goal we should tend to.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to bore ourselves more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to unconnect and appreciate stop times.
“In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it is difficult to find ways to start in something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a university and football player in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said one day, in September, he and a few friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to appear for possession of drugs and material that could serve for his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for its personal use, the answer to hundreds of businesses involving low drug use depends more on the location than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involved the use of marijuana have been classified without success.
Police have stopped blaming adults 21 years and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have called for to accelerate existing marijuana affairs and continue to accuse those who have it.
At the same time, several cities in Denver to the West Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of marijuana sales trades approved by the state in their neighborhoods.
“Things are evolving so quickly that I don’t know what the future reserves for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora’s police chief, in the east of Denver.
Washington State regulators also ask questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a license system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the date of the butterfly dated 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether you want it or not, is in advance on most state regulations on marijuana, first with regard to therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith recognizes, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no previous reality on which we could rely,” he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain suspended: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees adequate access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales stores within a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a playground or a crash.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install a licensed cannabis sales trade, particularly in Seattle’s metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokeswoman of the cannabis Legalization Centre, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates sent to Aurora an email to his officials, announcing that "City Attorney" (the public ministry representative) would no longer pursue people who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop accusing people of this type of crime "immediately effect."
Chef Oates said the police would apply the new judicial decisions that regulate the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "attorney district" (Republic Prosecutor), Ken Buck, incarns a more strict vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to take care of marijuana ownership affairs, mainly to press on users to make them disintoxicate.
At present, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are charged with other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to prosecute those who committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized crime," Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer make adults in possession of limited quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, the representative of the county’s public ministry, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like wasting my time to continue applying the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and government framework suitable for personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And contradictory reactions observed in different American cities emphasize the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana consumption and expresses himself as a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They have spent a lot of their lives pursuing people who were consuming marijuana, and they have difficulty accepting that it is legal,” he said.
As the first state to treat limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of legalization of drugs.
While state defenders and representatives provide a new border for legalized sales, they are concerned about the federal government’s guidelines, which are always designed to sell and cultivate marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will leave.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients with therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has primarily allowed marijuana sales stores to exercise for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police will probably not push the doors to catch small bags of drugs, there is a strong bet that it is opposed to authorized marijuana trades for personal use authorized by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former policy adviser of the Obama administration.
Many cities of Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local administrations approved moratorium on the creation of new marijuana sales stores, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and should impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
There are many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was distracted and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
These are not just today’s students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my elder brother studied in what was for me a prominent place to know, a sort of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates both pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after being installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my bags, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were disappointed.
The journal L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that first-class students had sex in the room next to my room.
The author A. N. Wilson said that I was leaving after being forced to drink in bottled cups.
The truth was less funny.
I've gone.
Yes, I fled because I was victim of intimidations and was subject to constant brimades.
Not because of my name rather insulting, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this so-called barbaric behaviour, I was victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser by Margaret Thatcher and I was a party party of the Conservative Party.
Why do you talk about this today, you'll tell me.
And well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of right-right students suffers the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hate for Tory students in Oxford is such as last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s Student Room (JCR) said they were “so often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” due to their political opinions.
They want a representative within the University Committee for Equality of Opportunities to allow their opinions to be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Youth, Intelligent and Law"), dedicated to the policy of students, and depicting the "Tories" as excentric and neonazis.
In particular, Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, trees a full silver and moves with a chrome head can.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as emissions bucks for the establishment of increased school fees."
Luke Black, 20-year-old Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that there is a growing left-wing party at universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting.”
21-year-old Samuel Roberts, a history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for further protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, OECD president, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are right-right.
“This constitutes a barrier to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one to think about this in my first few weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and was paralyzing.
The hate of the conservative party was very virulent.
Last year, the university voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher – a former student – a honorary title, due to the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalin vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when new students met with others and teachers, I had a pre-taste of what would happen later.
I found that teachers did not only participate in sarcasms with Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on Grevist minors, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa was grabbed in the woods of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victim was a translation of French texts from the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Ms Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my leg.
Pitt, a little man with a stubborn face, was easily handled.
“Is Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
“I suggest you take French courses during your free time – finally, if you’re not too busy to make friends,” he said.
I went back to my room, unconsolable.
At dinner tonight, I sat down alone and felt a slight tape on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James, who presented himself as a member of the OCA.
“I know who you are,” he said gently.
I'm afraid he'll be like that.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is taken for purpose.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claims to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
This stratagame failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic science, who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contagious.
Other students resumed the refrain.
I was perverted, shit.
"How do Tories Do Love?" asked one of them.
"They're struggling with each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Would I have been able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I become a worker and reject my opinion?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser of Thatcher and one of his speech authors.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started travelling between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hate Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredible.
During his studies in Oxford, in the forty years, all political views were accepted.
“But this is the best place in the world,” he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreaming clockers.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's to take you off.
This would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, Tory, also fell under pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session directed next week, when another history teacher suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "a enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
With inner shame, I admitted to be a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treating "old crazy people".
The repetition was short-term.
That's my father who shot the last clown of my Oxfordian circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed stuck in my room, and after five minutes my prosecutors left.
When they left, I made my bag and took the first train to London.
I've never been back there.
You can treat me with wet chicken crying.
However, no 18-year-old child should be victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also benefited from an unbalanced reputation of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian couture customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worth a show on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his unfair Italian accent.
This exhibition is the proud point of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and besides nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until March 3 next, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories like the trophies of his social ascension: from the modesty cowboy of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
There is nothing wrong with love for the kingdom.
“At least, they don’t screw their cigarette megapots on your beautiful cover as some pop music stars do,” baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza said.
In the 1960s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all would like to be invited to his Gstaad chalet," ex-woman of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauty of the past time such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has also forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
A few years ago, after a dinner on the Plaza de España, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, food, and music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," he recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the High Couture in Paris in 1995.
“He will never pass fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Defiled nobleness line
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession but of shared love.
He loves people well up and with the greatest titles and they also love it.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters wide that offers exchange of roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to go on the podium to admire a "deep public" with the main creations of Valentino, such as Fara Kennedy's taller who had chosen Jackie's for her wedding with Aristote Onassis, and Vi's costume
Among these mannequins are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsbourg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his customers say the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember that perfectly.
It was a shirt, a shirt, a shirt and a shirt of the Autumn-Winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he had done to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the cowboy's muses.
"I prefer it to everyone else for his feminity, his great love for women, and because he sublime our beauty," said the ex-duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and modesty Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget her first time she wears a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses.
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a wheelchair, a draped busier and a decollection to fall.
"It was a dream that became reality," Arenberg's widow Rodriguez said.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess of Arenberg keeps the cooker's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not just a dress, it is also all the memories she cars."
The "King" of Fashion
The great end of Somerset House’s exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress wearing her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the cowgirl calls it its cowgirls) to make this ivory dress with pearls, twelve different kinds of teeth and a four-and-a-half-meter string.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historic fact of the late 20th century's high-cost, "the return of the customers of the high-company".
For many years, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts and des Lettres, decorated with the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"I'm refined, calm, cared and perfect look always jumped in my eyes," Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If she is a princess who says...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 pounds of soda through the scratched stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell, and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by carrying the sore of the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the earth’s innerties solidifies to the air contact.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, weighing about 70 pounds, he installs them in two baskets of bamboo that he loads on his shoulders through the scarved paths.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano which is at 2,386 meters high, but the exhausted carriers put more than 40 minutes to grab this distance, at a tortue hall, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so that they don’t break down and fall into the precipice.
They know that a fake step could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Minors in Kawah Ijen earn 5 centimeters for each kilo of soup extracted.
Once upstairs, a road between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and wearing heavy baskets, they walk 3 kilometers up to the balance that a mining company has installed in a slight contrast to 1,850 meters of height.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 centimeters euro) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 centimeters) since this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture bouquets, craft fires, cosmetics, dynamite, and even serves to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupee (3,8 euros) per trip,” Anto explains, which usually takes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and it ends exhausted, but this allows him to win 138,000 rubles (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a miserable for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the fields.
“The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupee (1,20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupee (167 euros),” said the carrier who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupee (6,20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as questionable as the soup: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they're converting her to Java, and I'm Hindu."
Anto suffers from asthma, with difficulty breathing, constantly bleeding and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, with difficulty breathing, constantly bleeding and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years, because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in English more than acceptable.
Notwithstanding life, this young friendly and intelligent could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead, he does the work of a mule.
It shares an insaluble wood mass with other carriers, rise up every day at two hours in the morning because the soup does not cease to climb at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shine in the middle of darkness.
Defiing the dark, Anto descends into the crater by lighting with a small lamp attached to his hat, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers load the soup baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanically extracted sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own and are paid for weight.
In addition, they do not affect one of the 30,000 rupes (2,50 euros) of increased by camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupes (1,20 euros), which the guards of this natural park pay for tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not for humans,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old body carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
He is able to wear up to 110 pounds, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged 10 to 18 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and catches the minors in the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains about severe diseases... which obviously adds to their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and knees.
By balancing the basket on his back, the 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 pounds.
Every day, his companions and his companions extract 15 tons of soda from the volcano, three trucks carrying to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers from there through a trail of cattle invaded by the bad herbs.
“I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” says Unainik, opening the mouth well, revealing many missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a soup carrier.
The time passes, but the eternal misery of generations is one of the hardest professions in the world: the one who makes the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for this absence of children on career, stress and the cost of access to the property.
“The population of Singapore must grow.”
I am a husband and patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civil duty and give life!
It may seem unreasonable that these words come from an advertisement for meat pills, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread as a powder tray on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
Words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a policeman in the shelter" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the original video advertising agency, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill their "national duty."
It is intended only for the Internet, so we could make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we feel that it was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things, such as launching perfumes to pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves, what more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 Children
The Singapore government does not take it as lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leaves and distributes tax profits.
But all this had little effects.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders’ conservatism and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he found himself above 2, considered to be the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Division of Population, says that this is due to "better education" and "a broader choice of career opportunities."
“This has enabled people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the establishment of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the rise of the number of singles and delays of marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the rate of birth in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline of the population has created a feeling within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are abundance of xenophobia that is hardly disgusting against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of shooting down wages and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore-based party experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to address the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in nationality rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to touch the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "scotch box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sales win a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and encourage promoters wishing to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of Real Estate Company EL Developers, says that its "shouts" are selling much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built much faster than those of the larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to promoters, to whom they were previously put in wheels if they wanted to offer too much small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If it is so much that these new regulations can be a step towards the rise of national nationality rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the central financial district, it seems that they do not seem to have many effects.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that’s why people remit it later,” a young frame says.
Others can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” another twenty-year-old told us.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, the Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is Private Offline is Private Online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of the private domain or "the privacy domain we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for younger than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed by broadcasting on the Internet of events that he would certainly not share offline?
The journal elPeriódico surveyed five young boys aged 10 to 15, frequent users of the shirt.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" personally and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not disclose my most personal secrets in a post," Jorge, ten years old, when he is trying to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
“These are very secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post nice images or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I won’t share any of my photos or someone who would make it stupid,” he said.
The young boy admits that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, people deceived, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are of the family.
Her mother actually knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he added.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or to my friends quickly,” he said.
He said he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He won’t trust anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of Jose, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits not to know 20 of his list of friends.
“It doesn’t worry because we have something in common, for example, music,” he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked him his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or require it, I would just remove them from my account,” he acknowledges.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiments that we know today as cybercrash are not alien to the young boy.
One close to one of my friends was missed on a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just made it privately."
He then explains a series of manipulations to securely configure his account.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post pictures of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber harassment," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents, we need to understand that the aim of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she said.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, these are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves,” she said.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate to disclose, publish, or say to an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think about.
“Tell them not to do it is not worth anything,” she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to post a photo of you like a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are writing about you?
When you identify holiday photos, ask others for permission to identify them?
And also, do everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do it offline.
These are the same rules.
“When the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social media,” she said.
Surveillance
Studento Guardia, professor of university, primary instructor and educational adviser, says it is essential for parents to read the conditions of use of social networks.
By comprising each of the terms, they will have solid grounds to discuss with their children the implications of the opening of an account on the Internet.
“For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or publish,” he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that it is not necessary to speak to foreigners.
UNESCO Summit has ended without the Lima Declaration to be made public
The Sixth Presidency Summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 present representatives.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the United States, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported at the beginning that it would be disclosed after the summit closure, and then claimed that it would be published on the website from one point to another.
When they were interrogated about the text, they reported that their content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the noise of the presidential assembly with the message "private, limited audio session" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating among journalists was the information given by the press attachments from some of the U.S. governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of the present presidents, which caused a certain disturbance among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media claiming more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was host of the 3rd summit of South America Arab countries (ASPA) and, at this time, although this was requested by the press instance, it did not also issue the statement also called Lima Declaration, as it had previously been announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, we can verify that the document was published in March last year.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited information to the maximum extent.
The summit was also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that concludes a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the complainers of both parties in the trial Lima against Santiago, which begins Monday in Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we bring today before this international court," President Humala said, along with his Chilean homologus.
"Chili has always been, and will continue to be a country respecting international law, the peaceful resolution of international disputes, treaties and courts," President Piñera added, giving President Humala a handpiece alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents they would submit to the CIJ took place after Colombia denounced the Bogota Pact this week by which she agreed to submit to the decisions of the international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that she considered seriously wrong.
The summit took place without the presence of Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by UNESCO since 2011 after its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the debates in the morning and closing the summit shortly after midnight in Lima.
The mandate read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects had been fixed between South American countries for a total of $17 million investment.
One of the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of the United Nations would "appoint important measures to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits."
He noted that actions would be implemented to improve cooperation in combating urban insecurity and international organized crime, to improve drug access, access to the Internet at low-cost throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters.
With a crisis Europe, “the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumph matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and create a better future for our populations,” President Humala concluded.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by unifying our countries and creating new economic circuits,” the President of Peru said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were concerned with Peru and were located on the cross-border axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that both were targeting a greater connection with Ecuador although it had not given more detailed details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the country's electoral process will allow its reintegration within the South American Union," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another topic addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before the regional meeting began, he hoped to meet his Nicaragua homologus Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to quietly discuss the maritime dispute through a CIJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," President Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," President Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they plan to attend the adoption of the new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the same way, as part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of the United States, although the country has been suspended.
Peru ensures the provisional presidency of the regional block.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which “South America, in this case, must take example of Europe”.
President Correa, who participated in the VIth Summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told State TV, Peru TV, that the Europeans were "interested during World War II" and other conflicts, "but that they now almost form a country."
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member states of the United Nations.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andine Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he said.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President has demonstrated the reconstitution of the United States Organization (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Human Rights Pact.
Those who rebuild our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is uncomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is located in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, alleging the political asylum granted by the Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but on the contrary he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were grounded suspicions that Assange would be extracted to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes Swedish justice that demands that he submit himself to an interrogation on his territory on alleged sexual offence while "Swede's own legislation allows it to be done by video conference, which could be done since Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
It is possible that your physical and mental health may deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
“It works for everyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa notes that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Equatorial Embassy in London, which would be the award of a driver who would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities to find a solution and he emphasizes that it has been discussed in the UK.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European instances," he said.
And he thinks that "if the UK would approve the conducted from tomorrow, that would end."
And if Sweden, as it allows its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned it through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa used it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press, and he stated that what he would not tolerate was “mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the balance of hate, chanting and extortion,” he said.
In this angle, he welcomed that it was not such a type of journalists "never the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward its reelection, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and trace the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the U.S. at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "was supposed to be steadfast and not tolerate opportunism and deprived attempts of state strike" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers his Colombian homologous Juan Manuel Santos to have the desire to negotiate maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the La Haye International Court, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will of progress together.
They must be solved in their entirety to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he relyed on the correct resolution of the maritime border dispute that opposes Peru and Chile within the same court, and he claimed that "it is beneficial for Latin America to take international instances if both countries agree to accept a judgment so firmly that it is."
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to fight a third consecutive mandate, he reported that he saw this possibility "with lots of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primary in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never been interested in me, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador’s, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was guaranteeing this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we never lose, I will do it too.
“This is my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a reject of President Chávez's health status," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VIth Summit of the Union of the Heads of State and Government of the South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when confirmed the test result: seropositive.
“It’s as if the sky had fallen on my head,” he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "mindless" in vain.
The young man hid him in his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform him and his harassment was just as he celebrated his 43th anniversary.
It was, without a doubt, one of the oldest HIV unit patients of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, where there were many doubts, few choices of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was voiceless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
Nevertheless, ignoring their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "disrupted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, “the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same,” said the head of the HCG’s HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes for reference in this reporting year that this information was valid in April.
Andrade Villanueva, HIV/AIDS expert, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of the immune system affecting those that present patients at the time of diagnosis, with up to 50 CD rates for patients at the time of diagnosis, with up to 30 for those not consuming drugs.
To simply speak, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years old, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years old," the scientist said.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the Mexicans is today on average 76 years old.
If it is true that the mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (depending on the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the basis of national data are deceased.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not from access to treatment.
That's what I see, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they don’t know they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an unquestionable fact that “nine in ten patients arrive as they already have an opportunistic infection, what is necessary to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to perform early diagnosis and, for this, we need to offer mass tests to all those who ask for it.”
Specialists and members of the Jalisco (Coesida) State Council for AIDS Prevention agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a complicated tumour bearer of AIDS and suffered from a stream of sarcoma.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better to shine me three times a week,” they say, “it’s not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medicines.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anybody else.
“I work, I have lots of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I pay attention to myself and the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, at the walk of World Day against AIDS.
If they do the test, the sooner they will know if they are seropositive and better, and if they have already diagnosed, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Preservatives on the computer
There are many breakdowns between health programs and ordinary citizens, Guadalajara journalist Ricardo Salazar, who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of preservatives, before one or two were given, now we are given a hundred packages, but it is very good, but it is the result that, still today, some have no access to preservatives," he says.
One of the most vulnerable to new infections is teenagers.
The question: "What are you going to do?", asked with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, orientation advisers, pharmacists and healthcare professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that preservatives are not only sold to countertops, but that they are found in public toilet distributors and in the places that young people are visiting.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
It is also not about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when asked if there was a distribution of preservatives within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide preservatives to people who are already sexually active," he said.
Numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulated cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth state of the country in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination occurs sexually, 6% bloodally and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who don’t know it.
A Court of Appeal ratified judgment ignores the restructuring of the agreed debt of the Vitro group through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a previous adverse cause for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
Therefore, it seems that the survival procedures of companies authorised by Mexican laws are not valid in the country on the star flag, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the strike in the judgment made on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican companies unprotected against the possibility of embargo on their property beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to capture the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case reports that creditors must register under the U.S. bankruptcy law, the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit, seated in New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational businesses.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unity of International Commercial Law was established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment concludes that without the inter-sociation vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debt contracted by Vitro subsidiaries against the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Faillites had guaranteed debt.
In addition, what is certain is that since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in all manner the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the U.S. courts, i.e. the “vacuum” funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have gained it.
The vote would have been 45 votes against 37.
A data forgotten by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has encountered since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis facing the United States, replacing the country's costs.
For the moment, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurer appeal will claim non-prosperity and require the revision of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the friend of the court (“friend of the Court”) in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that it would free the two countries from conventions signed to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it notes that the country has joined the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carambole: they absolutely Vitro and they absolutely the country.
General Balance
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been silenced for several months, this was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aviation Pilots has already faced problems.
The instance, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Commission of Banking and Values, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied providing information to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw F/589 from the IXE bank of fideicommittee 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares from the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
They are sealing the Dragon Mars
Meeting at an amphitheatre at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and civil society members have approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of the country of the Great Wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite governors in the Southeast region to oppose the monumental project that is partly located in protected areas and represents the largest of all heavy threats to the industry.
The Acta is dead.
The government made a demand for the Senate to explain under which terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Anti-Conflict Commercial Agreement, known as its English sigil of Acta, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already from ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has been done well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered a violation of freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Hetin Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain bleeding condemns him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether it is as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, manager and head of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as a president.
“I have weared several basketball caskets throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s,” Reyes remembers when he visited Primera Hora at him in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he does that.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind his route out of standards, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those that remind him of his passing as a player within the Vaqueros team in the mid-1982s, after spending 15 years as co-manager or team manager.
“That was my best years, those I’ve most benefited because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been many years of satisfaction, including the five contested championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired during the 1981 championship, the year in which Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," Reyes said.
I recall that Gene Bartow, who had been the leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a coastal player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's just how Mincy started, one of the best players I've ever had in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was pleased with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only far away since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his charges and Mincy's charges in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the Pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then, there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we had to win the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't made us rejuvenate the last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, just as the Dream Team defeated at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the Cuban Pan-American Games in 1991, when we won gold and we put a rack on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one who had won bronze during the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who hadn't been able to attend a geno problem of 90 world.
A team that might not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy during the Neuquén pre-Olympic tournament in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacing players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan-American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
There is no doubt that it is Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Portuguese leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team consisting of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work Leo Arill does.
What is your greatest success within the federation?
Haver was one of the most glorious national teams between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left to do for you?
There are things I would like to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from the other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have seen at least the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball matches.
And of course, I benefit from the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became globally known for the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated a scrupulous, scary and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as scrupulous J.R. Ewing's oil magnate in the Dallas TV series has become a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year to the role of J.R in a new Dallas season, died Friday evening of cancer complications, according to a family statement sent to The Associad Press for Warner Bros., Dallas production house.
“Larry was back to his dear native town in Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her press attachment, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, enthusiastic and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he was living life deeply," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed a liver cirrhosis at Larry Hagman in 1992 and had admitted that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, a liver malignancy was detected and he had a stroke.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman was made known to television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedians that remained short at the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in cinema are the roles well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his magistral interpretation of the delicious hateful J.R. that Larry Hagman experienced his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million spectators were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most viewed entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s sister Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot her on it.
J.R. had been pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unwilling man but in charismatic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what it would need as an epitape for J.R,” Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, a corotagonist of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "immense man, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and unsubstitutable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is being implemented, the channel reported.
At the moment, neither the Warner nor the TNT channel have reported how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originary from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knows the celebrity with classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of New York Theatre in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
There he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in English: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s Impietable Memory)
“I haven’t written anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way,” he told the press at that time.
After his liver stroke, he became an active militant of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist troubled patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to operate and afterwards," he says in 1996.
I’m trying to give them a little comfort, like “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a while, but it’s going well.”
He was also a militant against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course about "The End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course at the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible chastisement: the end of the "big count" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as the proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was expecting him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax burden that some have called the "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict that involves Israel, the place where Christian theories of the end of time thought it would trigger the apocalypse.
“I didn’t realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give lessons on the "final of the world" this semester, which, in theory, will be the last of history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker dispenses the "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios leads a certain human behavior.
If the nuclear weapon fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could collapse.
This month, students will analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and learn how they can be compared to real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, professor Matthew Restall of Latin America’s History and his colleague Amara Solari, a deputy professor of History of Art and Anthropology, made a team to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," Professor Restall said.
Despite the “imminent disaster,” students need to study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be held in the evening of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the night of the presumed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have proved quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received email messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology, originating from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
Because fear of Apocalypse, whether it is century or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or absence of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, says he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a course that taught this matter,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students questioned, and even less a teacher, told us to believe in the end date of the world of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Maya prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," said Julie Zegle, a last year student at Temple, 21 years old, originating from West Chester.
The Mayas have never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I confess that there is an anxiety related to apocalypse in Western culture, back to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise of these speculations.
“In other places around the globe, people don’t think about it,” he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who gives lessons to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when he was asked if he knew we were giving lessons here on "the end of the world."
“The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a superior authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, many presumed dates of the last judgment have been discussed, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosopher on the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to light.
Many told us that they thought to go to “the end of the world.”
“Occasionally, I call friends and we’re riding together,” commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student in communications.
