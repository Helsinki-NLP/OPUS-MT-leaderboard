Nine-year-old boy in Tampere was found
Police have been searching for a 9-year-old kidnapping in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The missing statement of a boy from Western Tampere with her friend has spread on social media.
Police reports that the boy has been contacted and that he has no risk of life and health.
The son's father told the son's son in the middle of the night, knowing that the son was found.
He's okay, and now we're starting a post-explanatory.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the house, my father told me.
Ronaldo is coming back - the difference in Messiin
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paintings in the Spanish League for the weekend and continued his production in the Champions League.
The record between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo of the Champions League was the last one for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time painting statistics when he shot a visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two convictions of penalties and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his paintings to the 80s, when before Tuesday, Barcelona’s Messi has a total of 77 scores.
Real won the 4-0 match.
Juventus has been compiled in the Italian Football League in Serie A from the start of the season, but in the Champions League's D-square, it began strongly with the 2-1-square win from Manchester City.
The winner made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventure Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was a boring absent of Sergei Aguero's knees.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's gambling game, came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second group United experienced hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old ManU’s guest defence officer, was just a guard-hour.
Hector Morenon's dangerously-looking motion clause hit the paint towards the paint-induced ManU packet so bad that Shaw's probably broke off the staircase.
Shaw was sitting at Eindhoven's home station for a dozen minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to the 41st 1-0-minute drive, but ManU's pleasure took only a few minutes.
Moreno graduated before the break with an additional.
The PSV victory was made by Luciano Narsingh on the other half.
In the Champions League of the Maltese season, Paris Saint-Germain began the A-section.
The issue had changed the Manchester United PSG shirt by Argentine Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball to the back of the Malm's painter Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made PSG 2-0 for the second half.
PSG has been awarded to the successors of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but the Malmö of the Liga in small euro is not the best possible reference point.
PSG's star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his departure course at Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow lost the TsSKA in the B-section match for Wolfsburg 0-1 in Germany.
The opposition party prompted the separation – the president held the wrong speech
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe had the same speech he had had a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has repeatedly held the same speech he had held at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not realize that in a 25-minute speech, the word was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether Mugabe, a 91-year-old, is in full power.
The main opposition party MDC demanded that Mugabe separated from his job because this is too old to control.
Mugabe’s assistants hurried to say that the confusion had only occurred in Mugabe’s precursor and that the president had not done anything wrong.
The Mugaben speech discussed earlier and now the impact of China on the economy of the country.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have submitted additional EU leaders summit for the next week due to the refugee crisis.
President Donald Tusk, the leading European Council of Summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, heads of state should discuss cooperation with the emerging countries and how to get more effectively registered in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are included in the table of internal ministers.
Teacher admits his girlfriend ammunition during an emergency call
The voice of a slightly colorful university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that police have to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that his "gold dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said the close contacts of the deceased woman can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the page of hatred: "I'm so sorry I could revoke this lover of Amya and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said Lamb's letter.
Nothing pointed out that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Cleveland Delta State University of Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers of a school campus, where the police believes that he was assaulted and murdered historian teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this workroom.
Lynn Buford, police officer at Delta State University, told the university's officials about the shooting at 10:18.
He said he called Lamb's fateful emergency call for a while later.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased by another one: Lamb committed suicide in the circle of the police.
The authorities still tried to find out Lamb's motives a day after students and staff had been forced to shoot behind closed doors.
Researchers on both sides of the state have disclosed information that students and staff described Lambia as a talented teacher, however, with potential problems.
Students told him they were waiting for his hours.
Prentiss's death place, Gautier, police said Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb's book in which he thanked "a wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students participated in the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers rebuked Lambia, but said he also seemed nervous and discouraged, "as if something had been in trouble."
Another student Mikel Sykes told Lamb that he had a lot of stress at the end of the year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for a hospital vacation from Delta State University saying he had some kind of health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's wage principle meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate value, it did not guarantee him the automatic career development and the office of an assistant professor.
William LaForge, director of the university, said that there was no dispute between Lamb and Schmidt in order to know him, but that "of course Lamb's mind was something."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had escaped from the camp, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-calibrated gun on a backdrop of a house approximately 12 miles south of his parents' house in Mississippi Greenville, Washington County’s death penalty scientist Methel Johnson said.
The Lamb's car was still on the floor.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb just went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew people living there.
Lamb was in the area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009 and taught geographical and educational sciences. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with approximately 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed a PhD in Education Science in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told her that she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.
Hairston's friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older boyfriend who tried to teach Hairstonia to call guitar for many years.
He was a pretty hurricane at that time.
All the girls were sucking in the tank when he was there, said the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the Jackson pre-city in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss seemed to have been together for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a Lightning dog who lived with them on the river's tidal boat in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' former husband Shawn O'Steen told them they had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really shocked," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told her that she hadn't met Lambia, but she had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when both Lamb and Abigail were in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together with some cowboys.
O'Steen told her that her daughter is making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a number of different online companies.
The Julep Room bar and temporary entertainer Mike Shaffer tells him that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the last night of the 5th of September, when Lamb had stopped his guitar and lipstick proposal for the harsh audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
“It’s just a happy couple,” he said.
We swept and threw each other's blows.
They were both pretty nuts.
Deceased teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indian and colonial history, says school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three children.
He studied at the Emporia State University of Kansas and was chairman of his brother and student administration.
On Tuesday evening in Cleveland, the Delta State Campus held a candle guard, involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the exhibition during which the university's role sings the Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported about Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
This has been corrected by the fact that the police now say Lamb's emergency call after Schmidt shot, and that although Lamb referred to his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they had been married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less employees for vacation
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holidays as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current stable and seasonal employees are allowed to make more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in movements and distribution centres across the country, with 45,000 employees in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said the applicants’ interviews will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
While the holiday is months, the Christmas shopping season is nearing, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help in the construction of stores, as well as in the sale, shipping and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes With Princess Diana
The first day of the film's return to the future, Michael J. Fox was a professionally important moment.
It was also worthwhile for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theatre waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I thought that the place of Princess Diana was next to me,” she said in a documentary on Back in Time’s trailer.
The film starts and I think I'm just drinking a drink that I'm just getting away from the craftsmanship and the hand drawing from dating with the princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary from Back to the Future film interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloydia, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
He returned to the future 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's for me the greatest time travel film of all time."
Back in Time is available as an order video, DVD as well as some film theaters in October.
UN President says Syria will not resolve the situation
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's further military support to Syria is that the nearly five-year conflict is "not armedly resolved", and additional weapons only aggravate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The President of the United Nations called on all parties, including the distributed UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told the press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and France - in the context of the General Assembly of Foreign Ministers later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis as they demonstrated in the agreement on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 posts showing that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to cut him into a wind wind.
Others just think it's a joke.
Some are waiting for a breakdown.
Although some Republicans have tried to hide Donald Trump from the top of the attacks, it hasn’t succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys in the tenth, Donald Trump has been led by the two-digital chapter, and some have started seriously thinking about what this means for the real estate king’s appointment opportunities.
It’s just in the early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a candidate for Republicans.
At this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership position for Herman Cain, whose two were not given back to any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he has problems in general elections.
Nevertheless, external groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump’s flawlessness and have begun to use his funds to cut him down.
The following recent relief results indicate that the real estate king is not just a transitional stage:
Trump’s popularity has made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, the Monmouth University’s support statement showed that only two of the ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July the number was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the number was 52%.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans are welcomed by Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are treated negatively.
These figures are also true in the first prevalent states.
In a statement by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans said they would welcome Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be satisfied if Trump became a candidate.
In a question by CNN/ORC last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "raised" if he would become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson has the highest level of enthusiasm for the same level as Trump (43 per cent "enthusiasmed" vs. 40 per cent of Trump).
Next, the most excitement?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "injured" if Jeb Bush would become a candidate of the governor's favourite.
Trump’s fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his critical speeches and violations, 52% of the Republican voters on the national level, according to the ABC News/Washington Post, believes that the real estate king has a nature that suits the president.
According to a survey of Quinnipiac last week, the number in the first party meeting in the Iowa state is the same: 52% of Republicans believe Trump has a characteristic quality that suits the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, 44% believe that its character is not suitable for the Presidency, and almost six out of ten believe that its character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters believe in the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they believe Trump is a real alternative.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of 10 thought Trump was the most likely alternative to ask who would be most likely appointed Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of 10 people had Jeb Bush.
Publication: Voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball available.
At the last election time, four out of ten Republicans believed that Rick Perry would be nominated as a candidate, and only 28 percent of the final candidate, Mitt Romneyta, voted.
In any case, this shows that most voters of the Republican Party consider Trump’s campaign to be trustworthy.
While the Republicans would stand to support the second candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the sirpal field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, as Trump’s opposition has spread among many other candidates.
However, a questionnaire at Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral case between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives support from the majority in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie at 33 points.
She's in a balance with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump candidate to win?
If they were placed in the opposite direction, Ben Carson would win Trump’s businessman by 18 points.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters have said they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little over half of Trump’s profitable voters have decided who their vote will go.
The situation can naturally change, and no one can be completely sure that it will never change its mind.
46 percent said they could possibly exchange candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor currently is another unlikely winner, a neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice more likely to be on the side of Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants two months ago in his campaign speech, immigration has been in the middle of 2016 debate.
Some are worried that Trump’s ambition will drive Latin voters beyond the Republican party and harm rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems as long as immigration is in the middle of things, so is Donald Trump.
The disruption of the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, due to largely their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post ceremony that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than a person with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A two-week Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey from Iowa showed that three of four Republicans of Iowa have been disrupted by the Republican Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first-class in the Prime Minister's questionnaire
Corbyn’s first survey hours have been excited since his choice.
Labour workers’ new director Jeremy Corby will meet David Cameron for the first time in a questionnaire.
Corbyn will rise to ask the first six questions after a slightly half day, and it is likely that both the media and the representatives of the Labour Party will take care of their performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly display "less theatre and more facts".
He also said he could leave some of the opportunities to deal with his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Association of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour Party leader to stop silent during the national song on Tuesday at the Memorial Service, held on the 75th anniversary of the British Air Force, has raised criticism for a couple of conservative parliamentary parliamentarians and has appeared in several priority cases.
Corbyn’s decision not to sing national song has drawn attention
Corbyn’s representative said his “secondly silently silently” and that he recognizes “the courage of royal air forces in the British-Britannian climate war.”
Corbyn’s shadow government, Owen Smith, said to BBC Twon Newsnight that he would have invited the Labour Party’s leader to sing a national song despite his opinion that the King’s room should be stopped.
Almost a dozen Shadow Ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's internal circle by encouraging disputes in economic, defence and foreign affairs; at first, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party encouraged him to be the leader.
BBC policy exchanger Robin Brant says the line-ups regarding the role of the party in the European Union and the government’s aid coverage have also been “consecrated” within the working party after Corbyn’s appointment.
Corbyn said at the Central Association meeting that the working party would present a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Shadow Government Labour and Pension Secretary Smith noted that the party was "very clear" in terms of the fact that they only oppose government plans to calculate the roof of £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn becomes the leader of the fifth working party, whom David Cameron has encountered in the last decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Director of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to the policy, and now he says he has "commonized" ideas as issues to the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, the Parliamentary of Islington North, said that the nature of the Prime Minister's surveys is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from non-speaking and pronouncement instead of focusing on serious matters such as poverty, inequality and young people's challenges.
Corbyn has said that the Secretary of Shadow Economy Angela Eagle will act in his position on questionnaires when Corbyn is not involved, for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to use speeches, and he has said that he has approached the sub-chair, John Bercowia, of the matter's teams.
When Cameron went on to lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move farther from a political theatre that is often associated with Prime Minister's inquiries, but he later had to admit his failure.
Since the start of their television in 1990, the Prime Minister’s questionnaire has been an important measure in assessing the leadership’s mindset, his sub-room management, and his position in other MPs, although the critics have criticized the questionnaire that they have just become an excitement that requires remote news.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street boys have found a way to learn skills and know the truth about living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take pictures of their neighborhood and get a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first youths graduated from the project.

Pound value rises in the UK's wage growth accelerated
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed rise in the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9 percent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was the fastest after 2009, and it was considered to include estimates of the increase in the courses.
Punta rose by more than $1,505 per cent, and 0.84 per cent against $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49 percent rise to read 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and rose by 20% after the competition AB InBev approached it.
The deal would combine two of the world’s largest brands, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share increased by 0.9 percent after the competitive group of luxury products from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richmond's latest sales figures were expected to be better, and in addition they showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5 percent after the mining waste reported that it had collected $2.5 billion by calculating shares to the move as part of its debt cut strategy.
Mond's shares were the largest debiters of the index by 4.3 per cent since Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to the form of "selling".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sporting company announced its six-month income before taxes: 83 per cent increased to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports CEO says higher wages can damage expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, said that if the minimum wage of workers is raised in the UK, it could mean that "the buying power of potential consumers is growing".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
Costs could be addressed to the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash starts herb-level campaign against the invasion of Aldin
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA traders from the attack of Ald in South and West Australia.
Food wholesale Metcash has launched a herb-level campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia before the attack of Ald of $700 million.
Aldi prepares two distribution centers and its first trade opening early next year in South and West Australia with up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food brokers and build IGA brands through the vast stream of show and social media, as well as through the A-market.
IGA traders and acquirers have jumped together, and brands like Dunsborough’s ice cream producer Simmo’s offer taste in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their customers.
Metcashin is expected to disclose further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when this wholesale food, alcohol and iron market is organizing an annual investment strategy day.
There is a lot in the game because South and West Australia represents nearly 30 percent of the Metcashin IGA trade area, and there are higher yield margins than the IGA network in the eastern Metcashin states.
Visitors in South and West Australia’s purchases are well-known, and IGA retailers have a much higher market share in them than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30 per cent in the south and 24 per cent in the west compared to 14 per cent in the eastern countries.
Analysts like Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will pick up about 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening their first movements.
In a report by Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath, IGA retailers can lose $360 million annually and Metcash can lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 in the south and 30 in the west next year, producing $500 and $600 million in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at the high fixed expenditure base of Metcash can cost Metcash about $13 million of losses of business before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were most loyal to all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashin’s food and food sales will fall 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the head of the Investment Fund manager and founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at the Melbourne business store that Metcash could "be able to be lost in a decade."
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass’ comments.
However, it is understood that a member of the Metcash Government had contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA has declined from 18% since 2010 to 14%, and the revenue of Metcash’s food and food trade, which transfers products to approximately 1200 IGA retailers, has declined by 43% since 2012, which tells about the reduction in debt management of the operations when pressures on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale keeps half, and has invested more than $150 million annually in reducing prices of hundreds of products per week at the same level with Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers rebuild stores by increasing the faster growing brand of fresh food, as well as producing products to a better market.
Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcash, says that the price calculation and the increase in stores have increased its attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesale will return to the way of production growth in 2017, for the first time every four years.
Australian Tennis Union President Steve Healy supports Thanas Kokkinakis
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than critical behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer from a lateral storm, which has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and he deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Union.
The younger member of the two talented "Special Ks" Kokkinakis became unwilling to the public in a case in which Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after that, in the firefighting in Cincinnat, the head judge had to separate the Cockkins and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison stated: "Wawrinka should have been kicking Kyrgios, and I should have kicking that cake."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his country after the kramp destroyed his potential victory from Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy was the Kokkinakis inconvenient defender.
Right now, the young man is competing in Glasgow with Sam Grothin in a second place with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I'm pretty strong enough to think that Thanas has just been pulled up in the dark," Healy said.
He broke his country when he lost his country because of the cramp at the US Open, but he is not the first player to break his country when he gets angry, and I feel Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he's been very well-behaved, even in quite provoking situations with US Open Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves the body.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little hard.
He is very mature at the age of 19, he works hard, suits the team and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dress room, he practices hard, he is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be assessed according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take away Kyrgyz from the important games that started on Friday I described this "common decision" as a good solution to everyone, but I still supported the return of the Canberraan to the team.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all around the polemics," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer and Murray have noted, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all he gets criticism. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that there is the best for both the team seeing and after spending time out of public.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared an exceptional status and closed its southern border against Serbia by detaining those who attempted to enter the land illegally, with the aim of falling down the flow of migrants coming into the land.
The border followed the chaos when hundreds of immigrants gathered to an unparticipated region, and the Serbian authorities reacted by warning.
People who escaped the violence of their own countries have now set up their tent and set it indefinite for a period of time between the two countries’ inspection stations.
The madness, however, grew up.
While the police's helicopter remained above them, immigrants shook "Open the border!" and shouted injuries to Hungarian noise police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it was "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary when more of them are coming from Macedonia and Greece all the time.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, does not cause harm to civilians.
The discussion must be held in the next few days with other countries and Brussels,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The mixture at the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after the group of 28 nationalities failed at a disputed meeting in Brussels on the draft common immigration policy.
The Ministers agreed on the division of 40,000 asylum seekers, now authorized by Italy and Greece, and hopefully spoke of the final agreement - by the next month or the end of the year - on which EU countries take 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
Germany’s Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria will call for an additional EU summit on Tuesday next week, discussing the mainland immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbors or Brussels will act soon.
On Tuesday, the state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis, enabling you to close and accelerate asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that assistance at the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a part of its border against Romania to stop immigrants across the country.
CBS News writer Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were painted in order to complete aid between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and point of entry to the European Union for refugees, many of which have escaped the war from Syria and other countries from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are in search of economic refugees in a better way of life, not those under war eligible for protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a criminal the company to exceed or damage the four-meter (13 feet) pillow-chain aid built by the government on the Southern Sea of Serbia, and contain longer imprisonment sentences to human traffickers convicted.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring an emergency," government deputy Zoltan Kovacs told reporters south of Szeged.
In fact, we are very clear: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally accept the military position expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen a severely armed military personnel with its vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s home security officer Gyorgy Bakondi said that the authorities had captured 45 people while trying to cross the border, as well as 15 prerequisites to the country.
They have been injured by harassment, now being arrested by the police, and are accused of violations set out in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the field.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven cross-border places at the Serbian border on Tuesday morning after they had sent a trail-covered train to close one of these places.
The main border residence near Hungary Roszkea was covered by chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office for the processing of humans, and the crowds tried to enter.
About 20 people came in, but thousands left out.
A group of immigrants struck between main roads between Serbia and Hungary saying they refused to eat and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership on Bernie Sanders has crushed
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to be a bi-numeral leader in the Democratic appointment, but Senator Bernie Sanders arrests him.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic voters (reduced by 58 percent) and the second Sandersia supports 27 percent (reduced by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet stated whether he would leave his presidential election, but he deserves 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most Democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choices rather than supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has decreased in several population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly led by women and moderates, but his leadership has been undermined.
His popularity in male couples has declined significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percent points left behind.
Clinton's front trip around Democratic voters under the age of 50 has lost, and he is now at the level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is a leader in the parliamentary voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double number number in a couple of liberals, but now Sanders leads this group with five percentage points.
About half of the Democratic voters say they will support Clinton with enthusiasm if he becomes a party candidate.
Fourth said he would support him for certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be excited to support him.
The thoughts are more confused for those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only a quarter would support him excitedly.
In which 48 percent of the Democratic voters say they were eagerly supporting Clinton, a fewer Republican voters say the same about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had a suitable experience (16%), and then the most popular answer was that he was now the right time for the female president (13%) and that he was the best candidate for his job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being chosen were also mentioned.
As the Vice-President affects the potential presidency, 57% of the Democratic voters would like to see him already in the box - even though the thirds disagree.
Asking Democratic voters who would choose to appoint the second party, Biden is the most popular election.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they chose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to be a Democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton's leadership will grow from Sanders, if Biden leaves, the leadership is 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the number is 30.
55 percent of the Democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chances of winning presidential elections, but this number has declined from 78 percent last month.
By this measurement, Biden remains far, but the share of those who consider him the most voterable has grown.
When the Democratic voters were asked what the most important candidate was, however, they raised their opinions on voting.
In the last month, no candidate or possible candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are very successful in certain key issues among their party voters.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Bide is the best one in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
30 percent of the Democratic voters say they do not consider Clinton honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they do not have any opinions about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agreeing.
When considering all these matters, about a quarter of the Democratic voters say they have no opinions about Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and server as a foreign minister still raises questions, most Democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation and say that it did not affect their general opinion on him.
However, it is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third of them are satisfied.
The people’s opinions were divided in March shortly after it became a daylight.
Most Americans say that the e-mail policy did not affect their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion on him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinions about Clinton have become worse.
While Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters; only 32 percent consider him honest and reliable, and this number has decreased by 8 percentage points in the last month and 15 percentage points after May.
62% of the voters say Clinton is not honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of all voters throughout the country do not consider Trump honest and reliable.
But Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
Six candidates involved in the study are considered as most honest.
Sandersia is generally regarded as honest, but many have no opinions about him, just like not Carson.
The error margin in the study involved 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson Approachs Donald Trump in National Survey
Ben Carson is coming close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times question
Two candidates gathered half of all votes in the new questionnaire, leaving others to fight for the footsteps.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly supporting Trump, whose support has risen before the last month's Fox News election survey, from 23 percent of the CBS survey published Tuesday to 27 percent.
However, Carson grew up from 6 percent to 23 percent at the same time.
The questionnaire also noted that Carson was able to do so in a number of different demographic groups and is being isolated among Trump's higher-educated Republican voters.
The remainder of the field has remained, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasichia. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has decreased most: from 10% to 2% last month.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are at the third level at 6%.
The error margin for this latest, in September, 376 Republican voters' sample is +/- 6%.
Last week’s CNN/ORC survey showed Carson’s rising questionnaire: he has a 19 percent support for Republicans, and Trump’s 32 percent support for him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was considerably ahead of Carsonia.
As Carson’s popularity rose last week, Trump criticized the retired remaining neurosurgery, although Carso apologized for Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday at the campaign in Iowa.
Fifth member of the Brotherhood is accused of the death of a first year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania in the Brotherhood's symposium ceremony, the murder sentence was raised against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brothership team at Baruch College in New York City were brutally attacked by Chun "Michael" Dengin during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed in taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
The officials say that Deng's eyes were tied, and his back was loaded with a 13-kilo strap full of sand, after which he was repeatedly crushed to the ground when he tried to walk through the remaining field to paint.
Finally, Deng complained that his head was injured, after which he lost his consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number of Denga rounded, but, according to the accusations, waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to exchange Dengin clothes, search for information on the network about his symptoms, and contact Brother Andy Mengi's national president asking this advice, police chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual equipment and, in practice, put the brotherhood's well-being in front of Michael Dengin," police chief Wagner said.
The Deng wasn't released, and he died the next morning.
According to the Romanian Observation Protocol, Deng has repeatedly hit a boring object on the head, on the back and on the trip.
"Too many families have had to suffer from brotherhood, when at least one student has died every year as a result of this since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a Deng family lawyer, said in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be responsible, and this step of the authorities is important.
Monroe County's Great Commissary Team agreed that the first five members were accused of third-grade murder
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also accused of violent convictions and criminal convictions.
"We don't want only individuals to be liable. If there is an organization behind what happened, which has accepted the situation either officially or informally, they will also be liable," Wagner said in a press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood from the local department.
This happens when the U.S. Central Bank raises interest rates
Rate increases will come, and the market of rising rates will fall, the revenue of bonds will rise and the economy will have to decline.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long this will take, or how long it will take.
The past is hardly helpful in terms of time, especially in terms of economics.
Taantuman’s income has lasted only 11 months after the first increase, and sometimes it has lasted as long as 86 months.
The U.S. Central Bank’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often been, although not always, a determinant factor in how economic and financial assets react.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank officials have so thoroughly stressed that investors should not focus on this because interest rates are starting to rise, but mostly on the time to normalize the situation.
In fact, there are a number of variables.
Finally, however, the market partners can find that all the coronavirus-related distortions have been overlimited.
"The first rise after the global economic crisis of the Central Bank is inevitable in some areas to end the 'small money' period," said Julian Jessop, chief expert on global affairs of Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, although it is still low, there is a forming shock that many feel scary.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some economic areas will react on the basis of previous developments:
As seen in the market over the past approximately one month, expectation of interest rate increases can make the situation instability.
When an increase becomes a fact, the effect is not so dramatic.
“It seems that capital revenue tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first rise, which again potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey about what happens after the Central Bank rise.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market is usually strong, with about 14% rise approaching an increase, 250 days after that the situation is quite stable (average rise 2.6%) and the normal situation has been achieved after 500 days after the average revenue in the last six cycles in the journal’s strategy leads to an ana 14,4%, according to Bob’s headline – A Nuve Management.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually clearer at the later stage of the increase in the cycle when revenues begin to decline.
The rates are part of economic life, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the present situation, the Central Bank has faced certain challenges that have not been before and which can accelerate recovery.
This is particularly the gross national product, which will be the closest to its lowest level of all time before the central bank’s coronation.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118th annual GDP rise after 1950 was only twice less than 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, it is rarely believed to remain after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, the Atlantic Federal Reserve Bank said.
As a result, the increase in interest rates in the financial framework may be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different," said the Deutsche Bank.
Market partners have been preparing for the increase of the Central Bank throughout the year, and all are waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, the future trade expects only 25% probability.
“Our research has shown that since 1950, all the increases have occurred with an increasing vibrational effect in supercycles where GDP has crossed its advanced performance very quickly after recovery has begun,” the report says.
On the contrary, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the relapse, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been expecting the longest from the end of the last debt: the recording has been 35 months, and is currently underway in the 74th month.
The fixed revenue has also been instability in the market expectation of coronation, and the model resembles some of the findings made from the capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are seen faster in debt bonds than in shares.
The line of debts appears to change immediately with regard to the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the debt cycle, the debt revenue immediately decreases,” Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that interest rate increases the convergence of long-term and shorter-term debt bond productions, thus increasing the profit rate.
High-performance bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we're still careful in terms of searching for revenue," said Schwabin's fixed revenue analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the lines of the Central Bank.
“In addition to the decline of the dollar’s strength and inflation outcomes, there are several signs that the market has adapted to more strict monetary policy perspectives,” he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the yield flow is more stable, the margins of credit have increased and instability has increased - all of these are characteristics of the market when the central bank has stirred its line.
Generally, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are doing worse when the rise of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt is more expensive than they have funding.
“History shows that ‘Quality’ shares are usually more profitable after the first crown in three months,” said Goldman Sachs’ analysts in a customer-oriented report.
Companies with a strong turnover, undertakings with a low turnover in the years 1994, 1999 and 2004, were on average five percentage points.
Companies with high-performance and low-volatility shares did better than low-performance companies; the average of the above were 4 (percentage units) and the second 3 (percentage units).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of exchange rate debt are losing most, Goldman said.
Consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savings can also earn profits with higher productions, although experts differ from how fast the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative National Representative Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "candidacy"
He argues that the separation of it from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult.
In addition, he received the BBC Music Awards saying that they were just going to go to the Brit Awards.
President Damien Collins criticized The Voice saying it wasn’t original.
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming" into Classic FM, claims the leading legislator, increasing the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not.
Conservative National Representative Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to be "native" to its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to separate from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term 'translating' - is turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards industry, which was launched last December.
"Last year, the BBC Music Awards appears only to be a different name from the Brit Awards sector.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can directly remember when you actually just copy something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
BBC CEO contested the allegations claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of their commercial competition in terms of sharing live music and information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually the first class.
“In addition, I think it’s really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief Alan Davey argued that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the audience, because British know less about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only part of the BBC's offer that was criticized by the rise of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Cultural, Media and Sports.
Conservative Tory Party parliamentary Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition purchased by the BBC from the Dutch production company Talpa Medialta for 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique?
Lord Hall argued that this program of the BBC1 channel, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George are stars, has been produced in "the best style of the BBC".
He added that he wants the production company to "build success within its own house" the next time it starts a fun series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of the coming months of The Voice or to order the money of the authors to be spent in other entertainment formats.
Online sales have grown less in August, Black Friday may be the cause
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month, the rise was the lowest since the beginning of statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that Black Friday may delay consumption in November
The activity of virtual shares has grown narrowly for over decades and has transformed many of the UK’s purchases into strange cities.
However, experts say there are now signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only 7 percent rise in the first quarter of 2015.
The total consumption of August was less likely to increase since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only five percent increased from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7 percent rise in the first quarter of 2015.
“If we look at the growth levels of the previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be stable over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, JMRG sales index reporter, to Guardian.
He explained that three years ago the online sale was confirmed when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, like a sofa.
But now it’s a level, and (green) can be calculated.
The Black Friday phenomenon from the United States has been considered one of the reasons behind slowing down stores.
Experts believe that consumers will stop making purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the normal average of five times more buyers parked on their computers to pick up stores by covering many of their traders websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which made buyers argue about findings, can delay purchasing
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only one pounds in five were used online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the internet instead of using shopping fashion chains.
Muslims buried the dead in a Meccan rebellious accident, penalties for Bin Laden's family
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies on the streets during the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially accused Saudi Binladin Group of building waste breakdown
Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were injured when the rise broke down.
29 The dead were buried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to burie them, and the victims died when the rising bull broke down in the great mosque of Mekka.
The Syrians, mainly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last trip to the funeral land of Al-Moises.
The sad walk walked to the holy place where only a few days ago the rising cake fell through the roof of the mosque and dropped the worshipers.
The spaces were released to be buried when the king of Saudi Arabia strengthened Bin Laden's family's fault in the construction group, injuring 394 people.
29 bodies of worshippers who have been killed in a large mosque of Meca were carried through streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, in the Manchester area, who was his first sanctuary when the rising rack broke.
Akram had been a grandmother with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj-Haj-Saint-English.
Saudi authorities have already swear that the Hajj Mekka will continue as thousands of people are arriving in the city.
Today King Salman noted that Binladin Group should not have left the lift up when it was not in use.
The decision published by the Saudi Press Agency in the Arabic version stated that Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s managers were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out, causing the fall of rising bullets on the ground of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathered before the late Haji election this month.
Binladin Group has not published any reports on bad collapse, nor have its representatives been attached to comments.
The royal decision also convicted that it did not use up-to-date protection tools and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
Around the large mosque, there are ten lifts, which are part of the huge construction work led by the Binladin Group.
Binlad’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruler family for decades, and it has led major building projects.
Al-Qaeda's leading leader Osama bin Laden was a rebellious boy whose family was banned in the 1990s.
The storm occurred in wind and rain weather only days before millions of people arrive in the Kingdom for the sacred election, which every Muslim capable must do at least once in his life.
According to the report, 158 people are still in hospital.
The officials ordered a million Rs 174,000 pounds to pay the deceased and permanently injured.
Others get half of this amount.
B&Q-pomo says that Eastern Europeans who work cheaply are behind popularity
The British are increasingly using aid services, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
Following Screwfix stores for professionals will open 200 more
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the world
Writer Rupert Steiner, the city's main writer for Daily Mail
The UK is said to resign from its painters and paintings, and to prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do homework.
It looks like if you’re a keyboard with a shelf or paint the walls, you’re now in a minority.
The British are hiring more and more assistants to take care of the tea-self work in their homes, says the B&Q company’s head.
Kingfisher’s new CEO Veronique Laury, who owns the home repair chain, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe and that they offer their services at the price of a sharp price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for employees and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because the eight out of ten shopping decisions are specifically made by the most beautiful gender.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more of one woman's economies in which more domestic work is done than before.
Laury said, “The greatest part of our store staff is still men.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of the only five women leading the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index, and has rebuilt its management team in such a way that it has equally many men and women's staff.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with equal 50% of women, including its CEO and financial director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - the diversity is an important thing here.
It wasn’t hard to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher reported a decline in revenue for six months and sales after the group took the costs of closing the stores to its niche.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, opens 200 new businesses
The three-phase government decided to rely on compulsory legislation to save the economy of the country.
The visible effects were also received very quickly.
The firm decision of the SAK and other Remuneration Centres began to force the same path, and as a result, the country stands Friday due to a wide statement of workers.
A lot of people think that there is a reason too.
Ask if it is worthwhile when it goes bad.
Even counterfeit trades have been established.
Over 50,000 people have already reported that they are not going to participate in the statement but are going to work.
In the old good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no network to protest, but openly pronouncement of offence would have been the political suicide of a small human being.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of professional organizations is not a lot of time, but it is the subject of thinking.
The position of the union is no longer as clear as it was still twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows their own goals, values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest in the operation of the Ay-motion, governmental solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to the sky.
Once the matters have appeared to be rolling on their own weight for years, now, in the associations, we will finally get into the matter, i.e., the rights of the employee to defend, to be visible and to be correct.
Thus, the government may wish to imprison the role of the Ay Movement, when a membership in the union may be considered more necessary beforehand.
Whatever the actions of the organizations are, it’s a problem that the protest on Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has been stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has decreased for 31 months.
Gross nationality will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
I think these things would force everyone to think about it.
High savings for the University of Lappeenna: 8.5 million savings to reduce staff by 130
The Lappeenran Technical University will start a savings fee with a total of €8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the University begins nuclear negotiations on the entire staff with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 employees.
The rest of the operation is also aimed at saving two million.
In the background of the new negotiations, the budget for 2016, which predicts the actual activity will be 8,5 million deficits.
This also affects the budgetary operations made by the Government.
In this financial year, the university will produce approximately 2.6 million deficit results.
The costs will rise slightly for the next year, but the funding from the Ministry oil will decrease by 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is about EUR 85 million, so the saving target is ten percent of the entire budget.
The interaction between the university with massive teaching and research operations and the reduction in corporate finance is extremely important, says director Anneli Pauli at the University’s newspaper.
Before summer, the effects of operations seemed even more modest, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new measurements.
The negotiations with trustees will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Topic: Happiness wants Finland for railroads
Onnibus’ cheap bus company, British owner Sir Brian Souter, tells Yll that the company is also aimed at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in the Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK’s largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail transport must be opened to competition gradually.
The first is the turn of nearby transportation in the capital city between 2017 and 2018.
After nearby traffic, there is a remote traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
Onnibus’ plans are welcomed by the Ministry of Transport.
Other international companies are interested in rail transport, at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank has to make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows the side when the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
In Reuters’ survey to 80 economists, less than half of those who believed the central bank’s interest rates would still rise last week now believe that the situation is still unsolved and interest rates are still held at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event because since your central bank cut interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start the normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute senior fellow.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought to balanced billions of dollars and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less pink global views.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to rise, but signs also show them that they believe that the probabilities are against the rise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20.00 p.m. (CET).
Shooter at Delta State University left an apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "ashamed" of the first murder and hoped "that he could withdraw it," the authorities told Tuesday.
The Mississippi Gautier police said the teacher of geographical and social sciences at Delta State University Lamb called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
On Monday, she told me she shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send constellations to his home.
He said "he killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "small dog" in the house that "is not disturbing anyone" but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller the name, but he didn't tell it.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, there was the body of Amy Prentiss, a 41-year-old, and a message written by Lamb, a 45-year-old, who read, "I'm so sorry that I could withdraw it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb traveled nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed historian teacher Ethan Schmidt, before he finally killed himself late Monday, while surrounded him by police.
William LaForge, director of the university, said that there was no dispute between Lamb and Schmidt in order to know him, but that "of course Lamb's mind was something."
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb had believed that Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, there was no "leading information or evidence" of any kind of "triodrama".
Shawn O'Steen told him that he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "a good person."
A couple divorced 15 years ago, but stayed friends.
O'Steen told him that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "infuriated".
O'Steen said that Prentiss and his daughter were "his best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked at home manually online. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was Prentiss' close friend.
Knowles told him that Prentiss, a dog named Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help others,” said Knowles.
The police told their relatives who called Lamb on a spot Monday to tell them that "he doesn't go to jail."
When the police reached Lamb's 1st highway close to Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped his car on the road, left it there and went to the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about the education science in Delta State in spring 2015, according to a list of values found on the University’s website.
Stars that lost their attraction
Attorney (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001, he had leukemia, and in 2009, his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
He also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really requires its tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to dual destruction
Luke Shaw won his double-right leg when Manchester United was destroyed by PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defender stayed in tears and was out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw could still play this season.
Hector Morenon's Hollite strike was caused by the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area after 15 minutes.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double-broke in his leg, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day afterwards, and then cut in Manchester.
This is a bad thing. The boy comes to Manchester United when he is 18 years old, suffers difficulties and then plays greatly, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the dress room, he had an oxygen.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but duplication takes at least half a month, and he doesn't play in the blockade.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got or a red card and a punishment.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian supplier was divorced.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say that it became a punishment and a red card.
It was really a bad two-foot taklaus.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you for all of your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery starts now, I'll get back as stronger."
Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses for PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover from the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's really a bad injury."
If a player gets out of this injury, they are all very sad.
The purpose of our rescue is never to violate the opponent.
Moreno's foot broke when he played in the Mexican team against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this seriously because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I haven't seen it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see Luke’s scratch.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel so bad because of this, I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it will not last long until it learns almost outside.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When the childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favourite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seussin The Lorax, an environmentally friendly story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on SuperCamps’ website and continues: “Seek, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always feels like a picture or a message that we haven’t seen before.”
All this is true, but the next song in which Cameron is supposed to describe the mystery of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complete the rather short original text.
"In the city of Tarville, where all the nature has lost and even the air has a merchandise, Ted's son hopes to win his dreams on the side of the heart of the girl by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the true tree," the text describes as a love story that died in 1991 by Dr. Seuss, whose real name is not written by Theodor Seseli.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds locally as if it were taken on the Internet Movie Database's website from the Lorax film's puzzle, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a merchandise, Ted's son who's dreamless
Given the fact that Cameron is publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar to the mystery of a book. In it, a young, unnamed son hears how local nature has ruined the passion, the trees that begin and are in need for Kerskanen, without hesitation to the story of the name given by the "Lorax tree, which was a short, weekly tree."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably externalized to a assistant who has apparently never read a book 20 times later on to a child.
The Prime Minister said that the text came from the office of Cameron’s electoral circle.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s staff, but did not comment on it at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying on the side of England's team, but it was still a hard place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely to repeat the last 3-0 series defeat.
I wouldn't close any guestship out of the bills.
Alastair Cook’s half may be less experienced than the three-year rear team, but it involves good rounders and the team’s thoughts are strong: they have no arrows since 2012, only a youth positive.
Moee Ali develops in his recycling and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Related to: Adam Lyth hits England's cricket team, his status becomes Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but cruel truth is that cricket players are evaluated on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about the choice of Joe Root before the newspaper, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance will come forward.
English coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it won’t surprise me. Lyth is, above all, a team player.
It’s hard to answer the question how long a fighter gets to leave a track.
Lyth was chosen seven times as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was chosen nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play at home and at guests.
The only subject of the complaint is that the English chose Jonathan Trottin first for the Caribbean when Lyth was at the top, but that lost opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales will come together, and there's a hit I appreciate.
He has something that we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he made 236 points against us on Trent Bridge’s field.
He must give at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this really depends on the team's formation in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen's strike in Cook's nearby, where there would be an extra intruder on the field, but there would be four speeds, and I'm not against that.
I don't understand why a fighter could be hit there, and this left hand has already proven to be a pretty cricket player.
Moee may not necessarily have done his job in her county in Worcestershire, but he has three for them and there is hardly any difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the fall of the first coal before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points without remembering the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a stealing team, and, as far as I have been concerned with him, he feels very impressive about a young man.
People can look at his unprecedented statistics - a short average of 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a threat, but there's no too much eating and voters have chosen young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach party.
The appointment of a Sri Lanka fighter Mahela Jayawarden as a consultant for the games can be proven to be a neronleading.
He is one of the most comfortable friends of the game, and brings with him a huge number of experiences, because he has done everything in all situations and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will participate in the white ball games, bringing both energy and unpleasant departure.
I have always thought that he was born to participate in an international cricket, whether it was playing or training, and he has the same smartest to use as Mahel.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is in a single day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not make schedules.
And you must remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
Departure of Britain from the EU (Brexit) profits can profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's semi-renegotiating strategies to keep Britain in the EU are increasingly in day-to-day problems, even if not taking into account the heartfelt Jeremy, "Is it right or not?" Corbyn's choice for the leadership of the working party or the Central Association for Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragens.
The European diplomatic blood recently explained that because the EU is in so deep different crises, which are not all its own reasons, some Member States have been tired of the UK's self-centered agenda, full of disagreeable concessions and disruptive agreements that these countries mostly do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Association of Trade Unions decided that they would not want them if they would disrupt social protection.
We could even call it Daven and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late at the summits or bilateral meetings held in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument either with or without a local eyewitness, and then coming home saying they win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look out at the UK's EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," is said from Berlin - suggests that the shortest-like ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at such a point that they don't care we'll leave.
German Caution and Martial Allied Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allied, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her action before it gossip in the same way as it happened too long for delayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrandi (14) and Kohl (16 years).
France's François Hollande is faced with a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a relentless force.
In Poland, there may be a national right-wing government, in Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificed on behalf of the selfie Brits when their energy should rather be targeted to prevent Scotland from coming from the United Kingdom - they don't want it because of their own separatist trends.
So, my friends suggest that some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless observations to the Scottish National Party in the style of the UK during the 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process.
"Renewable negotiations had been held," and "Renewable negotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have been able to see how happily the Fleet Street newspaper was able to be and how the EU-sceptical newspapers were solely inspired by Tony Bennin during the 1975 referendum, when our membership began in 1973 was confirmed in the 2:1-year relationship.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the largest Europortunist, who made the name for themselves by writing "the EU's direct bananas" as a Brussels writer at the beginning of the 1990s.
Ed Miliband might be a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They include a number of tax collectors, foreigners who hack phones, and persons whose home is namely elsewhere and who own most of our great newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought exactly the same about them, but realized that if you were kidnapping with a hot gorilla, bananas must be abandoned because of the noise, unless you want to be on the dinner list of that gorilla and later on.
In fact, Miliband was more blair than Blair himself, as regards the opposition to Cameron's renegotiation temple, since Bair had committed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which French and Dutch voters would reject in 2005, thus giving Blair the situation of exit.
The press has never forgiven him.
But pleased Jeremy Corby, who friendlyly slaughtered me at the Westminster House on Monday (I told him that he didn't have time to destroy me), seems to be at risk to take back Neil Kinnock's 80's boycotted Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he has to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not with me, but without a doubt with Andrew Marri, who was left by BBC Governor Corbyn on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official role in Europe is, beautifully said, evolving.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Well, most of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party, outside of the Ukip’s war-making and the conservative party’s harshest nationalism, can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" Benn said so on both radio and TV this week, when his internal partyman had wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to be called John McDonnell's shadow minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his father was on TV trying to be unfaithful to the government groups of the working party without going so far to lose his government position.
Hilary's surfaces were more attractive.
But for that reason, the struggle to stay "in a situation wherever" - Bennin's sentence - was not what McDonnell said, and I don't conclude what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever it is, it is a distorted, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to transmit (record that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important during the period of the round-the-year television, especially in the social media circles, which are favorable for persecution and fraud.
As McDonnell said, it is just fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the working party in the referendum campaign to be clear.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental turning on EU membership (and, in line with their Benn-spiritual regulations and their anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult discussion on those left-wing ideas for which narcissism in small differences is a key dogma.
As for his bisexuality with respect to NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby wouldn’t give up the campaign), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their heads.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital (they also have uncertain voters) awards to the UK when it can be completely unruly?
The U.S. has already been somewhat disappointed in the poor British military execution in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even under the control of a conservative government, as I was reminded by the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize Public Health England’s Electric Bag Evaluation
Researchers have said that the State-funded Agency's claim that electricity fuels are 95 percent less harmful than traditional fuels began from a meeting of 12 people, with connections to the tobacco industry.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lanceti's evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electricity.
The PHE has published this report in the last month, describing it as a "double review of the evidence".
Nevertheless, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and linked connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In the past month, the medical periodic publication Lancet issued a headline in which the PHE's main guideline's "exceptional hutera base" was injured.
Two other researchers written in BMJ have considered whether the claims are "built on stone or sand."
Professor Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell, said: "The main principle of public health is that practice must be established for proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's claim "the best current estimate shows that electricity tobaccos are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional tobaccos" is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a meeting of 12 people that developed a multi-criteral decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were aggregated into the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was told to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people of the meeting announced that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding they had previously received from the Philip Morris International tobacco company, they added.
The selection criteria for panel members are not stated, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of which also report financing from the field they received in the investigation.
Others are not known for their expertise in the control of tobacco.
The PHE’s tobacco director also attended the meeting.
The study produced by the group "confessfully" that there is a lack of "uncontested evidence for most of the disadvantages of products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "there is no proof that electricity bags are working as a pathway for combustion for children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, says that the statements in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electric bags are significantly less harmful than burning."
Half of his life burned dies from his dependence.
All evidence indicates that the risks to health caused by electric tobacco are comparatively small, but we must continue to study the effects of the long-term.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence appears and what it does not appear, especially when there is so much public inconsciousness in relation to the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die from smoking diseases each year and smoking costs 2 billion pounds each year to the NHS.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although electric tobaccos are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only part of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we fill our national responsibility.
BBC should resign from EastEnders, former Channel 4 CEO says
Former President Luke Johnson said BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "have anything" from the soap series located on this Albert Square street.
Johnson said permit fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticized the BBC for putting programs in public service that are likely to be less public, against the most viewed programs of competitors at difficult times and on channels such as the BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said he tried Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with BBC, unwillingly.
"I don't understand the idea that BBC produces and sends programs that would clearly match unsubscribed competitors," Johnson said to the top communications committee as part of its BBC's future research.
If the allowance is kept - and I am not sure whether it would be a good idea for this message or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programs that others don't do and bring.
The Voice will be sent to its most important broadcasting time because it will want to collect as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that nobody else would look like a program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously crazy.
Johnson said, “I don’t understand why the regressive tax should be financed by programs that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one kind of and the other EastEnders, without prohibition, carried out inside the house.
In other words, the other channels would give anything about it.
I don’t understand how it’s about a public service mission.
I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.”
Channel 4, led by serial entrepreneur Johnson in 2004-2010, said the BBC is blamed for hunting audiences "for the people working on it, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series that resemble the comments of former Sky leader Tony Ball. He used the 2003 MacTaggart list in Edinburgh to suggest BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public service programs "pass to BBC4, where there is often no measurement of audiences, but the BBC is in its responsibility, and then can, in defence of 4 billion pounds of permission revenue, say that "we're going to do all of these unknown programs, we don't see any of them."
They put them in a mission place where no one ever wants to look at them.
Johnson said to the committee, “I want you to look for a more regressive system in who gets the most of it.
Of course, all of you think, we all think that 150 pounds per year will get a lot of money, but I don't know if it's right for those who have 150 pounds for big money because they don't use the BBC too much.
Former director of Skyn and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also proved to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its early task of "information, training and entertainment".
He said that only a small portion of BBC's production is currently classified as education - he said that the numbers are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from Australian and Canada's general radios and turn the task into "information, sharing and entertainment".
As for partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he said are displayed on television only by some of the numbers, and joining commercial companies in such a way that all of these can be viewed online.
"Audiogenetics" enables control of brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how the suckers change their direction as soon as the sound pulse comes to them.
Scientists have grown mammals with genetically modified nervous systems to be controlled by sound wavelengths.
Small cucumbers change direction as soon as they are involved in a voice-pulse, which is too high to hear the human ear.
Impulses function by connecting genetically modified cellular nerve cells with ultrasound reactions to film channels.
Related topics: Researchers read and write brain activity in light
The researchers said that the madose indicated the functionality of a new method called audiogenetic, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells out of the body by hand.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in California, La Jolla, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive action that leads the brain to electrical impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
Chocolates usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they are surrounded by liquid with a small microscopic cup, the situation changed.
He noticed that the chips reinforced the ultrasonic waves, which then entered the mattresses.
Strengthened ultrasounds affect TRP-4-ionine vine, structures that are present in some size cell films.
The sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to the report published in the Nature Communications magazine.
In order to produce ultrasound-controlled chocolates, Chalasani genetically modified the mats so that some of their cellular nerve cells are TRP-4-ionics.
When Chalasani used ultrasound to modified foams, microscopes reinforced sound waves and transmitted them to foams where they connected modified mobile nerve movements.
The method has the same features as optogenetics, a career-giving tool that allows scientists to connect and disable nerve cells by using light pulses.
However, Chalasas says that sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that needs to send an optical fiber along the desired direction within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue without impediment, so they can be sent to the brain from the head of the brain.
"We believe that the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic virus may be possible to get the subjected human nerves instantly react to ultrasonic signals in certain neurologic treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Unlawful torture tools - delivered to your home!
Advertising can be ashamed of British arms trade
Watch the video against Amnesty International positions.
Horrifying killing machines!
Squirting knees!
Sweatshirts!
Both e-pumps that cause pain but do not leave traces!
The delightful voice and serial iconic language do not doubt that this advertising of the world’s largest positions is a strong parodia produced by Amnesty International to emphasise the UK government’s willingness to trade weapons for defective governments at the ExCeL Centre in London.

With a separate campaign, there have also been a lot of bus stops and subways that require more accurate information.
"True information, Are You Traveling on the DLR Route on September 15-18?" is asked together by using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR line turns into a tank image.
Weapon traders will arrive on DLR routes this September... customers are asked to help stop the positions.
These 300 exhibitions are performed by artists whose works were presented at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs Museum.
A collection named Special Patrol Group helped spread records throughout London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This is a six-pound packing of six-pound keys, which according to the collection "access to a third-party of the publicity of the entire planet's bus stops".
Transport for London is not interested in this unauthorized "expressionism".
A Special Patrol Group's collection of parodial advertisements.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to bring political work to public outside the galleries.
Many artists have begun to work with activists in opposition, when they have realized that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
The other anti-arms store welcomes workers in the metro.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100,000 times over Facebook in the last 24 hours. It created a free advertising office VCCP, as well as a graphic designer and background lister who worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Leverin noted that the posts were not advertised at all – and also in ExCeLi’s calendar was then empty – and he thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertising of a dark-native corporation, but "they were more stopping to emphasize the matter with bright colors and animations".
“They have done great work to help us raise questions about illegal kidnapping equipment selling at fairs,” says Tom Davies, Amnesty.
Now the UK government has to take action and ensure that torture tools are not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art positions come from the inner side of ExCeLi, when the exhibitors trade fantastic decorated products.
In a press release, Saab announced that he received an order from the U.S. Army "on the AT4CS RS".
This includes "a unique pipe-blocking mark that focuses on the excellent effects behind the bet on the object".

Eight Golden Rules to Live in Student House
It's been 11 years since when I was 19 years old, I changed my student's apartment, and then I believed in barretism and moral relativism, but only now I remember the crowded smiles of people I'm irritating - and many, long complaints of others.
Most of my teachings can be summarized into eight simple regulations.
Change your apartment can be completely terrifying from any nerves happening.
It’s interesting to tell me where you’re from, where you’re from, where you’re from, where you’re from, what you’re thinking about Corbyn, and why “I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s actually just an extraction HAHA to find me from my room.”
Try to breathe.
And also help others attract the spirit - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find those people you like, and not those you wouldn’t want to talk to even if your eyelids are in a fire and they’ll split down.
Give people room.
People's rooms often turn into cocktails, leaflets and conventional entertainment sites, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don’t even imagine starting a university when you’re in a relationship
The university is a hard place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but in many apartments, it consists of a culture of walking from the room to the other, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell for someone who is trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you the promise to say "I love you and want to be a friend with you, but now you have to leave that I can recover the energy I consumed while talking to you."
Try to find out when a student boyfriend is tired of socializing - and perhaps send text messages to the door instead of crashing.
When it came to pass, it came to pass.
One guy in my student residence was thinking that if the door was not locked, he had been invited into.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through bread.
Since you start the university at the top of the bread master's trend, jumping people's doors with a chocolate plate and presenting yourself affects to a degree less strange, less "become to the neighbourhood, I have eaten something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from the 50th century.
Offering self-esteems is a great way to be friends.
Your resident partner will experience your duty to talk, and maybe they will continue to combine your face with a delicious surprise in the future.
This really depends on whether you know bread.
Probably mixed cheese-sugar-fat mosquitoes are likely to only get people to sneak sleep when you crash.
Stealing food is a common crime in student apartments.
Obviously, bringing somebody's egg is stealing, but what if you just take a cup of milk with your tea?
Ask and check the milk owner.
It is possible that they will give you permission, even if they're bothered internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's irritating and you'll get my sympathy, but try to treat it more adult than my apartment girlfriend, who mixed the washing machine in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to beat so that people can't sleep or study.
Not only to be a good person, but because you're like that proverb's bowl in the roof.
The girl on my walk asked her neighbor if they could play drum and bass music more quiet, because the hour was three in the morning and she had a test in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally cook at 5:00 a.m., the girl friendlyly let them sleep two hours before putting her own music on the pitch, closed her door and went to the three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your next spouse could change the same house with you?
Or vice versa, wouldn't it be incredibly tempting if you thought your next spouse to be your home partner, you'd beat together, you'd differ, and then you'd see him every day, and you'd possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what you want, but if a hot lodging partner isn't really your future spouse, you might even try to talk about meaning to your head.
At the moment that you notice that someone has left their keys unlocked in their room, the limit between cravings and cravings is thiner than it seems.
A good race is fun, but it's reluctant in a moment.
You can give useful and fun teaching about safety by hiding something - but never hide a room with a toothbrush and shampoo.
Close their doors and tap the keys into the water glasses, which you will then put on the pot - but do not attach their assets to a blue roof as much as twice.
Racist strike for foreign students' accommodation on Kite - a house formed as the sixth center of reception was built in Salsa
The accommodation of foreign students was carried out in a racist strike on the Kiteau North Karjala on Saturday morning.
Unlike the police previously said, it is not the accommodation room for disabled asylum seekers, but the bedrooms for foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time, the teacher of the Kiteen Evangelical National University Heidi Lulukkainen said.
The windows and walls of the national university’s accommodation were crushed with racist marks, such as hackers, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation, the East Finnish police said.
According to Luukisk, the youth of the National University’s Social Guarantee Education as a responsible scholar, the building was subject to divergence at the time of the attack of ten people.
“When it was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some might be elsewhere,” Luukkan said.
The National School has accommodations of people from 12 different nationalities.
They have been students who have been in Finland for some time and have only arrived asylum seekers.
All of the buildings in the building have a-states.
Some are studying at the adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish,” Lukkainen says.
A status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at once in Finland to a foreigner for a while.
East Finnish police investigate the attack as a injury and infringement of carpets.
According to the logical event, the students were considered to be an information centre on Monday, where they also had the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one wants to leave.
“We have had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens,” Lukkainen says.
According to the class, the dishes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected of at least three men and had been moving in a white passenger car.
I think this is the main point of the youth weekend when this topic is now on the surface.
Nothing more serious about it,” Lukkan said.
A hospital has also been deployed in Salsa, with a reception centre formed.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on MTV’s website on Tuesday evening.
On the wall of the hospital was drawn by a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
Police have a criminal report on this.
Decree 15.9. 16.02 Corrected information on the age and status of people living in the building by the police.
The state stops Y-train to Karjalle - passengers in their necklaces, "a lot of idiots"
The Y-juna travelling from Helsinki to Raseporin Karja will stop going in March.
The news drew passengers rising on the first day of the train on the Helsinki main railway station.
In particular, the downstairs hit chickens, said the town of Torbjörn Bengtström.
It's very idiotic because the population is growing all the time, and workers need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing but the political will, or the lack of it.
Bengtström says HSTV’s interview video will come to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train trains in New Zealand.
The H and R trains that run on the main path are combined as a new R line.
Purola’s position in the lake and Nuppulinna in the Tuusula remains disabled.
The Ministry of Traffic and Communications and the VR published on Tuesday information on the routes from which the Ministry purchases trains during the next contract period.
The contract season is changing in the season and the routes to be terminated are all over the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be completed in the autumn, will later be approved by the monetary committee.
Bengtström believes that the state train operator is a short-term operation.
Let’s make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic manner.
Then there will be regrets.
Y-juna also uses other than raseporians and Siuntians, as it is fast and crosses several positions.
From Espola, Annina Pöyrya suffered the fate of travellers to the city area by train.
“It’s particularly sad for those who have to plan their trip again,” he said in a painful Y-join.
Small ease is permitted.
There is a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y-rail (HSL) in the Helsinki Seudu transport area, i.e., to the Church.
This brings more costs to HSL, i.e. practically to the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices,” said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to evaluate the costs carefully.
According to Rihtniemi, on the basis of the number of passengers, HSL has paid for a million Y trains per year, the ministry has certainly paid much more.
The next R line will be between two positions.
Instead, the number of train routes in Ainola and Sauna will double.
All over the country stops 28 small stations and numerous routes.
The ministry no longer buys train traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinnäki.
The Pikesmaki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pikesmaki-Vacuum.
Junavura routes are reduced by Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips are made annually, with a total of nine million transport trips purchased by the ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring an annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter in the chapter of the Capital: "It's worth familiaring with Marxis"
The global economy crisis has risen to the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his decision published in 1867-1894, written as former President of the GDP, Yrjö Hakanen, in the book published today, The Date of Marx Capital.
"They are taken more seriously now than for a long time," Hakanen wrote in his pre-speaking.
Marx’s assessments of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalization and penetration in all lifestyles, the concentration of capital, and the rising role of capital and imaginary capital have proved to be a stunning remote perspective.
The book book based on capital seminars is also found by the professor of the University of Aalto, honoured economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is the current "new and eternal".
However, isn't he the former director of the Research Institute of Business and the Delegation of Business?
No, no, no.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marxi as a current economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences have been distinguished and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literature.
“The ordinary concept is that the history of atheism tells about the false opinions of the dead men,” Korkman begins.
The truth is that Marx's prophecies have gone badly.
While Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from capitalism.
However, Korkman sees the value in the radical positioning of Marx.
“The most important thing in Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
We are now discussing Marx’s interests, such as the sharing of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical deformation," Korkman said.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is not helpful.
He believes that capitalism is an unhealthy case that should just end.
However, Marxian believes that Korkman should be familiar.
"In the 1970s Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
“The Maoians and Trotsky and the others hated all capitalism, but even more each other.”
Today, the debate is more versatile, and Marxia can also be approached without an ideological and political burden for years.
"Every social scientist should get acquainted with the world of Marx's thoughts - as with other classics," Korkman says.
UN demands war crimes in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a Special Court to investigate warfare in the Sri Lanka Civil War, the news agency reports.
The UN report on the 1983-2009 Civil War appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as the Tamilitians.
In the Sri Lanka Civil War, at least 100,000 people are estimated to have died.
There is no accurate information about the number of victims.
In particular, the large-scale attack of armed forces in the last few months of the long war in 2009 should be investigated properly, according to the UN report.
The Sri Lanka arms report accuses of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, whose victims are as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the captains were accused of compelling both side and children to be fighters.
Both parties have been accused of murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it plans to organize an investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the UN court because foreign judges.
In England's yo-test, social media has been deployed.
In autumn, the postgraduate letters had a long foreign language, mostly English, on Wednesday.
English skills have been tested by more than 16,000 students.
In the experiment, he could write the material even on social media.
Based on my own experiences, it was necessary to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unfortunate.
Alternatively, the article of 150-250 words in English may indicate the web page’s advisory ball to the holder.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelian rest seat.
He asked how parents should look at things for young people as well.
A total of the subjects of the substance were four, of which one had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them," estimates the third subject of Porvoo Swedish high school lecturer Mia Lybeck.
On the third subject, there was only a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, Lybeck said, was nice again.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people at work.
"At least in our school, we have practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment as "something quite normal."
In the Finnish - or Swedish - experiment, you were able to answer questions about the texts that included, for example, the summer camp's adaptation to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
Autumn writings will continue on Friday, and there will be another domestic test, namely Swedish or Finnish.
The tests are normally organized in the classes, i.e. the statement of wages does not affect them.
The University College College is calling for trainers to search for appropriate transport connections in time so they can be tested.
Additional time can also be obtained if it is possible to show that delay has not resulted in your own inconsistency.
Trading in Oulu was stolen with gun threatened
The shop was stolen in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and covered his face with a command line.
A man is normal and is about 30 years old.
The police said the man had threatened personnel with his hand and received a small amount of money to capture.
We're investigating this as a serious thief.
Police reserve tens of thousands of demonstrators to Helsinki - support parties from other parts of Finland
The protest that opposes the government’s operational decisions will be supported by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, the police predict.
According to pre-information, up to tens of thousands of people can get to the site.
Members of the associations of SAK, Akavan and STTK will meet at 11 p.m.
Police are also believed to participate in the protest.
On the other hand, the task of the police working is not only to carry out warning tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the progress of the waste airplane.
The roads leading to the rail sensor are closed from motor vehicles for about 9:30-14 hours.
Only alarm time vehicles can be accessed to the area.
The traffic from Hakanie will be cut off from the Kaisanieme motorcycle, from the west from Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Office, Lieutenant Seppo Kujala?
To date, at least it seems to be enough.
I don't take my position in the police's workfighting.
According to Kujala, there will be support parties from other parts of Finland due to the protest.
The police don't tell the exact numbers.
“Something is coming, but as a rule, we will be able to do our own,” Kujala says.
Police call on avoiding private cars in the center of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic summit extends from the Hakanee level to the nuclear center.
Transportation is expected from morning to morning.
With demonstrators arriving from Finland, there are also a lot of booking buses coming to Helsinki.
They will not be delivered to the Railroad Tower.
The buses are usually time to go ahead.
The end of the trip must then go to a demonstration place,” Kujala says.
The atmosphere also stops Helsinki's mass transport.
From the police point of view, there is also a positive part.
The problem of mass transport flexibility, which is normally available in these large crowd meetings, is now in part dealing with itself.
The protesters have reported to the police that tens of thousands of opponents to economic policy may be in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the declaration to be calm.
People are ordinary workers or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
"Yes, Finnish are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala notes.
Local protests will also be held in various parts of Finland on Friday.
On Friday, the declaration of thought is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these lagoons and declarations?
The great protest organized by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference point for this in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä, emeritus Martti Sisiäinen.
It is not surprising that the Ay Movement is protesting.
If it wasn't, it would raise hands in front of the government, says the internal.
The very right-wing government has attacked the traditional cores of Finnish corporateism - as well as those that have been important to the development of the Finnish well-being state.
The government's harsh assumptions lack contractual right.
Here are a lot of characteristics that the Ay movement is actually trying to get to the knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all salaries for Friday's statements.
Now, the new is the sharp division that the spirit of the Ay Movement wants to participate in the demonstration.
Several unemployed meetings in Finland seemed to be demonstrated in the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point on Friday, it could be the unemployed waste processing, organized in 1993 by Murrostorstai.
In the middle of the deepest lake, Murrostorstai collected 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon (Central) compiled from the labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish government and wagemakers' organizations had never been as bad as they had before during the Ahon mayor administration.
Now the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than the time of Murrostors.
In addition to this, there is now a very high-burrier government in Finland ever, the internal said.
The current government coalition is still interesting in this way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the basic Finnish speeches.
There were still some elements of the old working movement.
A number of thousands of protesters are expected on Friday.
The spirit atmosphere also stops public transport and possibly closes daily houses and schools.
Although the declaration receives undivided support from the salaries, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, around 300 protests have been held each year in Helsinki.
You have to put them on.
Traditionally, demonstrations of Ay Movement have been quite quiet in Finland - although practices have increased in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is legal.
Demonstrators try to avoid damage or destruction of the property, said the internal.
The end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of thinking has changed.
The EU membership encouraged farmers to throw eggs and the police were ready to get a pig.
The fire lasted three months in 1998.
There were also apparent fleets amongst aircraft carriers and aircraft managers.
Do you remember these lakes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical trails of the 1970s
The most important lakes in the 1970s were metal lakes in 1971 and power and electric lakes in 1977.
The lake of metals was involved in 70,000 metals.
The team was suspended for seven weeks by the Committee on Conciliation.
Metals have received a 16 percent increase in wages.
In the spring of 1977, the electrical plant lasted 49 days and caused electrical breakdowns throughout the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, approximately 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met in front of the House of Representatives to demonstrate their consent for the work.
Firefighters fired three months in 1998
The blast of fires was one of the greatest in the 1990s, unless the largest national blast.
Farmers opposed the EU from 1994 and 1999
Police attacked the eggs in 1994 when farmers protested against the EU.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," one of the strikes.
On the back, the farmers jumped tonnes of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also encouraged farmers to protest and burn the balls in front of the meeting.
Nurses decayed in 1983 and 1995
In 1995, nurses were deprived for about a month.
Last time they had been in the house in 1983.
A number of deaths occurred during the 1995 lake were painted.
Tehy was threatened by the massacres and nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass transfer has finally accelerated the negotiations to the outcome.
The doctors stopped in 2001
"Doctors in the lake - forced," was the stroke of deprived physicians in 2001.
The collapse of municipal health centres and hospital doctors took five months and led to a sharp discussion on how lakes could endanger patient safety.
After the law, the public sector raised the wages of doctors.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students marched on behalf of the study support from the Senate in Helsinki to the House of Representatives in 2013.
The Central Police Explore Refugees Full of Finnish Backgrounds to Austrian Police
Austrian police have asked for help from the central police to investigate the background of a Finnish registered refugee refugee.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
I don’t know if it was possible to travel to Finland.
All of them were in good condition in the cold.
We had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is at the site of the event in Austria, Tero Haapala, Chief Officer of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, refugees traveling with a truck in Austria were more destined.
At that time, 71 passengers who were on the road were apparently killed by attacks.
According to the General Radio, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the branch belongs to the Finnish shareholder company.
The company operates restaurant activities among other things, and its executive director is a foreigner, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
Refugee's captain, former hummer and upper businessman - the story of five secret drivers
The upporic King of the mysterious drivers, a violent Russian kidnapper, a stylish missionary and a good taxi kidnapper.
For example, such people are carrying out human trafficking into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at Trent University have met and interviewed dozens of mysterious drivers and their “clients”, and the book they wrote by the Dead Travel Office will appear in Finland this week.
In the book, they present human traffic ports, provide solutions and present mysterious drivers from different ports of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll hack them as soon as you think.
Kerkenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading to the summer tour.
For its location, the islands are also ideal for secrecy transport, since the journey to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometers away.
Due to the comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attayan, lives Emir, a chain burning Captain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their cutting-edge, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
Emir has done this with blue, ten meters of wood for hundreds of times.
If the boat is fully closed, there are 40 people.
On one trip, Emir takes about €8,000 after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for customers around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during their Arab Arabs, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape discomforts.
After that, the situation was calmed up until the refugee crisis rediscovered.
Customers arrive from the continent to Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir stays in empty houses for as long as he looks good.
Food is given so that the customers will live right and right.
The accommodation costs about €75 per night, and if the customer ends with the money, it's their problem.
We'll go to the water at midnight with a short break.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, waited for the day, and the next night is driven to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea trip is hard, and in the 20-meter scary waves, passengers cry and get rid of it.
At the end of the day, the human being has been kidnapped in half an hour and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants him to be scared.
That's why he fucks his customers and at least claims that he's trying to get the hangers out of life.
He says in his book that when the police suddenly hit him, he threw all of his passengers over the boat and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I threw customers out of the niche alone and threw them over the layer," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I'm sure he's going to be worried about this.
I'll get out of them right away.
They must immediately show who's going to be here.
It's a normal taxi.
Goran is a typical taxi in Bogotá in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the start engine is pushing its last and otherwise it's seen the best of its days.
However, the main thing for Goran customers is that the taxi moves mainly, and that it moves towards the border of Hungary.
Bogovaða is about 60 km from Belgrade to the suburb of 500 inhabitants.
Near the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are accommodated.
In the forests around the center, men traveling without their family stay in tents, flats and rejected cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest that have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia for any reason or other reason.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the Medes, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often walking trails - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walks in difficult landscapes, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When finally arrives in the Bogotá region, to the point of destruction of large human trafficking, people are deadly.
The Goran Citizens are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in his book.
"They say their case once and it's enough," Goran's body.
He said the Africans were trying to pinch.
Goran doesn't like that.
Caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves,
For example, a price of EUR 300 will be agreed first, then they will lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind man.
I don't care about money.
“I just do my job and help people,” he said in his book.
Goran tells us to work cheaper than others and to pay for only €50 per person on the Hungarian border.
The trip is three hundred kilometers, most of which is comfortable on the highway.
I would like to hear a three- or four-line price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It’s not a big amount for the driver, but in Serbia it’s pretty nice yearly income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometers closer to the border of Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the distances and takes his wheelchairs a kilometre from the border to the head.
Then he will show his customers the right direction and dismiss them.
Peace in the work
A 35-year-old Congolese is called a missionary, and it is not just a favorite name.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, with many refugees from Congo, as well as a small centre with helping Congo children refugees.
In addition to the preaching work, the Missionary turns out to be a mysterious bishop where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at his work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He shields his shoes several times a day and ensures that the rubber milk of the white crystals hangs stylishly under the low belt of the jewelry.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercede, his landcar and three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five telephone numbers of the messenger.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money of the whistleblowers and shatter the mixture of traders crossing the border.
In order to receive asylum seekers or refugee status, the Uganda authorities have to tell that they originate from, for example, North Kyiv War Areas and have had to escape violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the Speaker will arrange a new identity to the customer.
The old identity certificate is deleted and another is acquired.
This helps the missionary contacts in the Uganda police.
After that, the customer will be guided to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum seekers, NGOs, ultimately to UNHCR.
The missionary feels bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He calculates individually: submitting an application to the Uganda police costs approximately €100, handling documents to the humanitarian organization approximately €150 and migrating to some European country, for example, €4500-7000.
Folie and ice balls
Tom is an initiating secret driver, an ex-season driver.
The 40-year-old Irish man grows on the French coast of Calais, where his work is to load people on the road to Britain.
He has a help from an Afghan, a French taxi, and dozens of passengers who may not necessarily know that he is in a civilian transportation business.
At night, Tom and the taxi attracted their customers, usually 2-3 people, somehow near Calais's center.
They're driving the A26 motorway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have been forced directly to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want, he's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs over its customers' motorways to a place where some sleep before going through the channel to Britain.
Tom chooses the right line - to make sure he's on his way to England, not anyway to the Netherlands - and cuts across the security line.
You have to do it quietly so that somebody won't wake up.
Sometimes somebody is involved in the work, but at that time the turkey is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom swallows his customers into an aluminum sheet, similar to which is swallowed in the kitchen around a patch or an oven.
It should prevent the police's heat scanner from seeing a hidden man.
Some people use the same suitcase for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers and leaves the place hopefully that no one will suck the guards at least before Britain.
The King of the Secret Drivers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world’s most famous human traffickers.
The original Turkish is called the champions of marketing and the uncontroversial king of the illicit Mediterranean land rise, governing sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new secret transportation methods.
He also has a competitive advantage for other entrepreneurs: he only requires money.
One of the new methods is the luxury boat shuttle: Turkish ports are rented for entertainment with the U.S. or European families to a few days’ tourist attractions.
In fact, ships are charged by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdish and Afghans, which are transported for a fee of €5,000 to €7,000 first from Istanbul to some port and from there to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, such as in old industries, until the time is for them to leave.
People are shut down in minibuses and driven somewhere on the coast.
They are told to hide among the plants and wait for a sign.
When it is given, the ship must get up quickly.
Travellers must stay the entire journey under the burden.
The marine guard can only monitor how deep the ship swims, as other signs of the mass are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers exit and vomit, the better.
Küçük gets around EUR 53 000 from one luxury trip.
He does not handle practical things himself, but hire captains, painters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to do the work for themselves.
In the summer, there are at least hundreds of transportation and millions of transportation in Küçük.
He is believed to have purchased through coverage companies through the country, the pharmaceutical company and more than one hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time with a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he has apparently disappeared.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Dead Travel Office book will appear this week, not next week.
American Olympic Games reports in their book about the disease and adoption of prostitute
Three times at the Olympics, Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book, a 1,500-metre driver, has drawn attention to the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and thinking of being a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published the interruptions from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career for the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the top and ran in the cars for the second best time.
In the final, however, he became panic.
He immediately ran to the top and defended his headquarters on the ground run.
150 meters before painting, however, his strength was successful.
He broke the rail surface, and the other competitors guided him one after another.
I felt stupid and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the painting line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, Favor Hamilton suffered from bi-directional mood disturbance.
His brother Dan had made a year before Sydney's killing of suicide, and he himself felt enormous success pressure.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she was prostituted in Las Vegas.
The couple had no economic problems, but he was motivated by the idea of getting money to have sex with strangers.
He also talked to his husband to accept his actions.
Hamilton’s favourite taxi was €450 per hour.
He said he spent his money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for prostitution was also that he missed the same adrenaline movements as he had received in his competition in public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton learned that he had two-way mood disorders.
The duplication of the former star streamer appeared at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters at the time of the World Statistics 3.57.40, but remained last at the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion rejoiced when the alliance put the Norwegian skies on the curriculum: "Freely"
The Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of convenience for at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have turned off the sporting agreement throughout the summer and autumn of last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been eligible for a multinational world champions and Olympic fans.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian ski union decided to exclude Northugin from the upcoming season's World Cup.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was pleased that the union put a skier in a hurry.
“Thank you for showing your back,” Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the Union sponsor,” he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and Northug is about money.
Northug would probably like to be part of the season in order to advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that would also take care of future generations and not leave one athlete alone.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know it because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because it is best.
Northug published a newspaper on Tuesday, in which he convinced that he would want to play sports in the Norwegian colors in the next season in the World Cup as well as afterwards in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six championships, two of which were golden.
He attended the last winter in Falun when he won the message gold.
The day of the translators will also be held in the North
On the expiry day of 25.9. there will be meetings in various restaurants and shops, which have been granted the Pill of the Translators.
The aim of the day is to emphasize Finland’s high levels of knowledge in the food sector and lower the threshold for departure from the restaurant and increase awareness of the significance of the kidney as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital area, but the top restaurants that are checked by an independent actor and classified throughout Finland.
The international attention gained by the event is an evidence of the importance of the event as part of increasing the reputation of thyroid and organization.
The day is organized in the Vaas restaurant in Fondix and Kantarellix.
In the Cocktail, the Old Town Restaurant is attended.
The event has also gained significant attention internationally.
The event has been decided to make one of the most important international events of the organization, which will be held throughout the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: complained of the establishment of a terrible reception centre to the Chancellor of Justice
The immigration agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are collaborating with LSK Business Park Oy’s refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava facility.
According to the complaint, the region remains lasting in the context of the critical infrastructure of the crisis, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, namely, by the Finnish Erilli Networks Oy.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private person, the placement of a reception centre in the same building facility would constitute a significant security risk that was not taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area of the former Air Force College and in its airport, whose impacts are not so examining in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
The case is noted that, in the case of the Kauhava field, negotiations have been conducted over the last two years on the organisation of the flight training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, among other things, with Defence Minister Jussi Niinist (ps.) and Chancellor Arto Rädy of the Ministry of Defence.
The individual states to the legal Chancellor that the complaint does not have a question of the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former equipment area is wrong.
The horrific city government addressed the reception centre last Monday.
Syria’s situation reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The management means that there are the necessary conditions for the immigrants and those present here, the Ninicie commented on its occasions to the journalists after meeting the presidents of all the representative parties with their office apartment in Mäntyniem.
According to the President, the concern for the management of the refugee situation was combined with all the participants.
He appreciates the fact that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to confidentially discuss traditional issues.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges.
According to the statement, the situation of Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States may also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea.
It is a desire for the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, namely, the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and continue to be stressed by the Baltic Sea.
The NATO question was also published in the discussions.
The President did not hold his position on the labour market.

Media researcher: Sipley takes a great risk
According to the sipil, communication needs a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one of the channels among others.
There will also be a need for such a direct talk in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in the House of Representatives.
Sipilä had not yet wanted to assess how frequently the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are.
It is not necessarily important that talks continue on the top channels.
If other channels are announced as a channel, then let's look at it.
This channel will be used tonight, Sipil said.
The state of Finland's economy is so serious that it requires a televised and radio conversation for citizens.
This issue, of which we are now talking about, is quite complex and requires a longer reasoning.
That's why we reached this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast at 21:05-21:20 on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also see it in the Yle Arena.
Pine takes a great risk
The media researcher hopes that the Sipil Television talk will not tell the more general about the turning into the government.
Do you intend to take the strictest decision-making right of the public debate in your own hands and to refuse the questionnaire of the public debate? considers Professor Anu Koivunen at the University of Stockholm.
It is remembered by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin's quiet comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
On behalf of the democratic debate and the public, I hope that these matters are not related to each other.
I'm trying to understand that the commercial media has been confused with the announcement of Sipil.
It would be weird if the media field wouldn't react.
The communication styles of political leaders are not declarations in democracy.
The task of the media representatives is to make sure that politicians do not take action as they are given.
According to the study, television talks are at high risk for Siply.
In his speech, the silica should bring something new and special to the table to meet the exceptionally high expectations set to the table.
Do we have more than what we have heard today?
Or can he speak in a different way, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
The devil says that if there is only one more in the authorization of the same old one, you need to wonder why such a great creature was done and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Most often, take this risk in mind, if there is no special situation, but routine talk among others.
The danger is that Yle will become a message of politicians or representatives and governments, which is certainly not in line with the Yle interests or the general line.
Sibling Oven bet
In the forthcoming speech of Sicilia, it is also important that what the Prime Minister will leave without saying, the media researchers emphasize.
In the evening, we need to look at exactly where Sipilä is missing and where not, says the research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä Heikki Kuutti.
According to me, the TV talk is an open betting from Sipil, because this can bring its own views without sounds.
This will provide a large audience without a journalistic filtration, unlike in the press, where journalists can ask critical questions.
He goes through the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong from the speech, because accurate questions cannot be raised.
According to the cup, it is very important how Sipilä appears on the TV - the swallowing pocket, whether the hands are washed.
He compares Sipil with the daddy's moon, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä is able to make the matter well, it can work.
The situation is different than when the government would have informed about something, because this person is like talking directly to another person.
President Barack of the United States, Obama and his partners are regularly engaged.
Very exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens really exceptional.
He said that this has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is talking directly to the people.
The exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to get the Finnish to acknowledgment in front of the crash.
Remunerative organisations will organize on Friday protests and illegal government actions.
The President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter that Sipilä could hold his speech on the status of the nation in the presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The President of SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), once again declares his challenge in the dialogue with Sipil.
There is no time for monologues now.
Within six months of elections.
You can't hide infinitely, Rinne writes on Twitter.
Nine-year-old boy was found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy's father updated on his Facebook page.
The Police Office of Finland also confirms the case for the Dinner.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 p.m.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My dad thanks all the people who have helped in searching.
Thank you for your ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
Finland's UFC star deceived young people's violent wildlife: You'll get hate
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish volunteer, has published a video on Facebook, which is particularly entitled to immigration for young people.
Makwan Amirkhani held a pressing speech against young street shoes.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived with his five-year-old Finnish family, has won both of his professional competitions in the most prestigious UFC series.
My friend tells me that he received a message that asked me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos that are uploaded to the account, where young people are fighting for the extremely violent takeover.
Amirkhani says she's disappointed in the wildlife of young people.
A 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The rest of you take off the landless, sit on one another and hit the other immediately without thinking about any of these consequences, what happens when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people seen in the videos are immigrants.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, immigrants and Portuguese youth have downloaded videos on social media.
It's called that you're fighting over your head in the street.
You are making so much harder for the lives of many other immigrants here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
My company reminds us that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very serious.
It's a bit hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you're going to be strangers for a long time here.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani invites young people to remember their neighbors.
If they are sometimes subjected to racism, you can blame yourself.
Just think about a couple of times before you go to that, dear friends.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You're going to get a bit of hatred that I don't even like.
Anyway, you have things too bad, and that spending isn't going to improve them, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on a savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly said on Twitter that the wagemakers’ organization would consider its position to present STTK on an alternative savings list on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s Twitter proposal.
STTK told the Government that it would submit on Wednesday its own proposal for achieving a five-percent productivity position required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it demanded that the SAK’s largest wage-winning organization would weaken its previous position.
In turn, SAK President Lauri Lyly commented on this on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Labour Committee will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK is looking for solutions to "open a marketplace" and the need for agreements made by active parties instead of compulsory parties.
Lyly reminds us that the proposal for a social treaty by Prime Minister Sipilä was not eligible for the SAK.
Sipilä would previously discontinue social negotiations when the SAK did not agree to engage in a five-percent productivity target.
Comments on: The greatest distortion threatens to blow up - "It feels like a little bit of fun to tree the nut"
It’s a little bit funny to tree a necklace, if in the pocket already has a matching paper, write Pekka Tiinanen.
Tunnels vary from placement to placement in the wages camp.
Does the government intend to scream or agree with it?
On Monday, the federal leaders of the SAK took a vacation of sacred hatred against the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened to be arrested.
The heart also spread to the lights.
The OAJ’s professional organization threatened to close schools and houses.
On Tuesday, OAJ revoked that no school or dayboats were completely closed.
On Wednesday, the President of the STTK Staff Centre, Antti Palola (sd), appeared appropriately.
He stated that he had been in contact with the government and had set up a five percent productivity time for the alternative proposal required by Prime Minister Juha Sipila (Central).
President Sture Fjäder (kok) has hurried to report that his paper is already ready.
Initially, the SAK office did not belong to the SAK.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the allied leaders just ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Labour Committee will meet next Monday to address the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to "open a marketplace".
In order to create a joint presentation of the salary recipients, SAK should tend to adopt a five-percent productivity point to the objective.
No wonder that Palolan STTK has a good relationship with the Government of Sipil.
The right hand of Palola, director responsible for the social interaction of STTK, Jukka Ihanus, previously served as special assistants of the Prime Ministers of Central Affairs, Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kviniemen.
The ball also characterized that the government’s ay skills have improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s exit took a bit of cleanness from Finland’s stopers whose headaches were stopped by ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
It feels a little fun to tree a nozzle if in the pocket is already fitted with paper.
Modified at 18.00: Add information about Lylyn's comments.
Russia has defeated Finland as a poor host: "This can't be repeated"
Russian President Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki Etyj meeting.
Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin believes Mongolia is better Etyj guest than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Batori, the meeting of the Ethiopia parliamentary general meeting, where Naryshki gave extensive comments on the celebration of Helsinki in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians on the European Union's penalty list, such as Naryshkin, to a meeting - a question that the President would remind reporters.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshk stressed the news agency according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism focused on the United States, where his access was also blocked.
The sanctions are a political suicide against the EU, Naryshki declared.
The Russian delegation of Mongolia came to a complication, so Naryshkin continued Finland's swelling by encouraging and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary general assembly will work constructively and positively - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue does not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanervan, the leader of the meeting at Ulan Batori, who, according to Russianism, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock faces the real playoff song: "The countries in the strict"
Tappara and Lukko continue today in Hakamets, when both are fired on a regular day.
Janne Lahti predicted that today in Hakamets there would be no real paint festivals.
Tappara visited the 3-2-time winning KalPasta in the moon last night.
The rise was male, because the silver group of last season was the worst of the loss of two paints.
On Tuesday, it was more profitable.
As a guest of the Blues, the Rumians had begun in the jail, it was round zero points, and the loss cells were as well as 2-3 years old.
Hard game, paints in strict, if any plays the same game as last year, Lock-attacker Janne Lahti predicted settings on track pages.
A fairly heavy playoff is made up of the tapper.
In the past two seasons, Tappara has been in the midst of the Luko final.
On both sides the solution requires a decisive seventh match.
Last season, Lukko took the series to the break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose up in the three next breasts and ended.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for paint areas.
Both of the fighters last night will get a oil year today.
In the taparian painting, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Karhus, and between the locktops Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolskin.
View angle: A hard play in the current
Athlete director Toivola wrote the head coach to the Iron Castle an inappropriate postpartum, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote the Rocky film, where he himself played the main role.
The supervisor sent sensationally on the camps for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky had a great sympathy, even though he finally lost the title.
Thirty years later, after Rocky's first birth, Mika Toivola wrote the story of the unleavened pore.
The non-nominated and wooden carton is the surprise of all in the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of non-names such as Rocky, but a bitch of submarines.
There were White Indians, Porin Mattia and Pele Pelto.
In falling games, the players colored their heads in red and cut the ironies.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The eagles took the anointed silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Hoivola believes that the innovation stage of this season worked in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports manager in Asia has built a potato for the poor boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been kidnapping off the rocky pigs by kidnapping.
The merits of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparisen are somewhere other than in the game.
Hope has forgotten that Rocky VI will present the main part of the Pekka Iron Castle.
Karri Kivi crossed the Iron Cake to Sean Connery.
The Iron Hall is a recorder in Rocky as much as Connery would have been in the original version of 1976.
There's nothing else in the railroad than the favorite name.
The game philosophy of the Iron Cake does not include riding and small fishing.
He appreciates a hard game, but there is a different thing to play hard like pigs.
Last season, the Asian Garret Stafford hit Tapparan Jere Karjayan head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Hill put a man's shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept that game and it's not part of the Iron Castle, which has been visited after the game, to the National of Satakunta.
This season’s team has been constructed strangely.
There are trains, veterans, cops, and cohorts.
There are no key players in the best game age in practice.
It’s not surprising that the coach has complained about the art.
How much have you been able to influence the gamers’ procurement, Pekka Iron Valley?
The events of the last season influenced the procurement and the situation on the market was sadly soap, the Iron Hall responded diplomatically.
It's all over the kite.
In 1953, the Iron Castle was interested in moving to the place of Toivola for a sporting vacation.
Men’s contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the eagles in the three leagues of the season has equally many losses at the paint range 1-6.
Hope wouldn't have been worth writing a postgraduate part.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing to do with them.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of her husband.
Yeah, I'm showing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
It usually feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to the ex-Basist and director Tuukka Temosen in Apulan since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together in the past, but now Olga plays for the first time in Tuuka’s guidance.
The role of Olga in telling us about the early years of Apulan You made us beautiful in the film is a rumpali Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirke shakes and supports her son, even though this father Risto (which is represented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the sound of the sound.
The more I’m familiar with my real example in the circle, the easier it is to perform a role it feels going.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for giving me a role.
Olga had met Sirkan before the film project, but after that, the two had approached a lot.
They've met, spoken by phone, and messages.
Sirkka has really helped a lot.
We have gone through many different corners of their history.
Fortunately, the circle also understands that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to paint a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become Finland's largest band.
In the 1990s it was old and really anchor.
There was a very small probability that someone would really succeed, but the circle had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that he had heard a lot of this from Tuuk’s youth before filming.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been slightly different.
Yes, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you are doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the Heinola's dirty skeiter known as Tuuka.
Olga was a shelter and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tukua.
At the highest point, he could have been hidden from love.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka in 10 years that the big joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always been super good.
Now the entire production group is going to be described in Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in the East plans to go home often for nights because the distance is not too long.
We rule the whole Heinola for a month.
They have taken us very warmly, just asking what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 is the most expensive film in Finland
The budget of Iron Sky: The Coming Race, managed by Timo Bergensol, is €17 million.
The descriptions start in Belgium in October.
Directed by Timo Vuorensola, Iron Sky 2 film in Belgium in October.
Iron Sky: The Coming Race continues to be Finland’s most expensive film ever with a budget of €17 million.
The most expensive film in Finland was Jalmari Helanderin Big Gam.
The animation of Angry Birds will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2 as the film's budget is over €100 million.
The film directed by Timo Bergensol and Tero’s remote film begins in October near Antwerp, near AED Studios, and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is going to go to Belgium next week.
The waste budget isn't afraid.
I've been sick relaxing!
I have so relaxed with the script, because I know exactly what kind of work should be done.
Everyone in the working group feels aware that something unprecedented is done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is strict, there is no fear in the fucking.
I’m more excited and I don’t want to wait to show this leaf to the audience, she tells the evening.
Originally, the film’s budget was 8-10 million, but the budget also increased in the development of manuscripts.
The budget is big, but it's big.
However, the film should be injected 100 million because each image corner and performance are so expensive.
Now it's all so strict that there's no findings.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched on Wednesday a mass funding campaign and a mass loan, from which a 4-8 percent annual interest rate will be paid.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within the last two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film is featured in Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Cocktail or cool?
Big logos come back to shoes
Trendsetters’ breasts have recently decorated large logos.
Even some time ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocse’s focus.
The advertisement of a hupper or t-shirt was seen as a junction.
Time is changing.
Sports has become the right fashion megatrends, and so also old, well-known sports brands like Adidas and Nike have risen for cooling wavelength.
And as often before, the boundary of fun and trending is confusing: if something is already a good junction, it begins to become ironical and cool.
First, the norm core trend, i.e. the tavism fashion, where trendsetters were surprised by preferring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey basecollegen, we will insert the grids that are already buried on the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo is beautiful.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adida’s rail networks, favorite team games and New York Yankees tickets have also returned to the calamity.
The Calvin Klein logos from the beginning of the edge of the feathers are now cool details.
The trend seems to be moving from sports gambling to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breastplate of the Versace blades makes clear what the sign of the clothing is.
Would you be ready to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician issued a statement: I haven’t been a Jew for years in the tank’s bone!
According to the statement, a special interference would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian emergency ministry had to remove the large Zotovia tanks for five hours.
Zotov has done all he could to object to the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, in which he appears to be curious about the bones of a pantry vehicle in quite good moods, and at least on the basis of their images, it’s not about jealousy or anger.
Full of stupidity.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the fighting band, but it was the band band BMP-3.
I am an ex-soldier, Colonel Lieutenant, I have served Ural.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov told Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I wasn't Jewish and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
On the Russian Army TV channel, Zotov explained his admiration at the exhibition of the new technology of Russia because he was the former professional military.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the cars, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the backpack, he said.
I went to all tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all riding tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov was also a stupid writer who wrote about it.
One stupid guy wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and humble, but nothing like I'd be somewhere in the tanks, it didn't happen," he told the Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words support the fact that no photo of the alleged Jewishization has been published, although a total of 50,000 people occurred in the arms exhibition within a few days.
The allegation of Zotovin's injury began to move from Bloknot.ru's story, where Zotovin was told to rip out of the tank tank while trying and threatening to shoot all around him unless he gets to his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a continuation in which the organizers of the exhibition reported their own views.
Everyone just realized that the soldiers jumped quickly out of the cars.
But the parliamentary Zotov, due to his great collapse, simply defeated when he came out.
But he wasn't sitting there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.
Here's one of your favorite interior bloggers
Architectures Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's Candlestick from 1962 looks like it was designed today.
The cubic steel frame is like an artwork, and it was originally.
Architecture designs are known for a long and thoroughly mathematical shape of the candle.

Canada’s mining company Agnico Eagle has been invaded by the Kittilän-square in Finland.
The purified process water of the golden bowl has been removed from the so-called wealthy sea tree to its branch.
According to the company, measures to correct the failure have been started.
Below is neutralized enrichment sand and cleaned process water.
Usually, the water is either pumped to be reused as process water or transferred to the environment in accordance with permission through the surface lighting field.
The volume was estimated to be about 300 square meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of waste water meets the current permit conditions.
There were no other substances in the environment.
The vacuum was observed at the check-in circuit on Monday morning.
No fluid has been detected causing structural damage to pathogen structures in the pool.
The company reports that it has been working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs approximately six hundred stakeholders.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns to cut too much
The report of Finland published today by the International Monetary Fund of the IMF follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The system was struggling with structural reforms covered by Finland to tackle economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction in excessive wages and wages would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and for unemployment safety.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuppamäo, structural reforms are in agreement, but there are small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of good news for government actions, but on the other hand there are also warnings on what should not be cut too much.
Such are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Ekonomianom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in a timetable to support weak economic growth.
The IMF predicted a 0.4 percent economic growth for Finland this year, accelerating to 0.9 percent next year.
Danke today predicted a new relationship forecast for growth to zero this year.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis of the latest observations.
This morning, the Statistical Center said the total production was in a small growth summer, Kuoppamäki noted.
The weakened confidence of the industry or other so-called softer measurements could have been paid less attention.
However, there are only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo's death toll appoints a new leader
In July, under cancer-deceased Satoru Iwat, Tatsumi Kimishima began working on Wednesday, Nintendo told Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The 65-year-old Kimishiman's choice is not a great surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwatan.
Kimishima is a safe choice for tracking Iwatan footprints, the analyst of Ace Research, Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s mission is to be seen to bring Nintendo into mobile games strongly, but it does not eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish immigration agency acknowledged that even hundreds of children who arrived in the country disappear each year.
According to the Swedish immigration agency, hundreds of minor applicants are missing every year on their website, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelmaa, Inspector of the Imigration Agency, tells us what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many of the applicants are missing "under the land" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 single-person asylum applications were made in Finland.
They disappeared nine.
Similar applications were made in 2014, 196 of which were missing 11, Kannelmaa reported.
On the grounds of the loss, it may be that in the process, the applicant is already registered in another country applicable to the Dublin Regulation and he may have been found there to be a full age.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to lose than to continue to process the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they seek asylum from some other Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, 134 of which were taken a withdrawal decision due to the fact that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers have disappeared over the past few years.
Is the number growing?
As of this year, we have received a total of 586 individual asylum applications.
There are still no statistics on minors missing this year, but the number of minors is known and has clearly increased, which is also likely to affect the number of missing, he stresses.
What about the conversion decisions?
Will they be lost, for example, on the “small labour market”?
It is difficult to evaluate this by the immigration agency, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the return decisions, the complaint emphasizes.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been worried about the growing number of unregistered countries.
He's been taking action in this matter.
On Monday, at the EU's Refugee Ministers Meeting, Orpo reported practical action to get the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to control Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen selling Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of equipment
As a result of disease attacks, the equipment used for television and radio production by Mr. Timo T.A., who has lost his capacity in the media industry, is now on sale.
Mikkose's husband Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which at the time was the most advanced equipment of professionals.
The online announcement was the first online magazine tonight.
Today, most of the equipment has remained in the footsteps of technological development.
The digital media world no longer describes television programs for Betacam nails.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are interested ones.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date, but it is necessary as long as there is an old generation of materials that need to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of fans - collectors and builders of their studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkosets are trying to turn away from their current Storskylän home.
We can't bring all the goods with us.
I have started inventing and seeing where the goods are being given away.
This is what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use of TV and radio devices.
The trace of later brain infarctions is clear that a man who has made a long career does not return to work anymore.
Nina Mikkonen notes that we are now only selling goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkose’s real lifework was archived in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited the box shop to take films and other materials from the Storskyl.
Your traffic threatens to get worse: Metro and railroad cars can stop on Friday
Metro and railroad drivers today decide whether they will expand their powers on Friday with regard to the statement.
The original plan was to stop the transport of metro and railroads only for the period of the protest on Friday.
During the afternoon, the traffic stops for the whole day.
The chief trustee Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is large in the field.
Night and rotary operations hurt drivers, so the government’s plans for cutting clips awaken resistance.
However, the horror thinks that stoping traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and railroads stop on Friday, public transport is virtually entirely in the capital area.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between evening and evening on Friday.
On Friday, there is no nearby or remote transportation.
Trains departing before departure are scheduled to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left to the trail.
ACP members are gone from work on Friday morning at 3:00 a.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by the Chief Executive Officer, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo arvelee.
Repo says HSL is unable to tell exactly what bus routes are going on Friday.
The Remuneration Organizations will organize a major celebration on Friday at 11-13 a.m. at the Helsinki Railway Center.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tears.
The incident occurred at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used waterboats against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas - teacher thought his own watch was a bomb
Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old in Texas, has been arrested after the teacher had to take his own clock to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show up his production of electronics.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looks like a bomb.
Police were invited to the place, and the situation finally ended with the kid being taken to the young man's arrest in his arms.
Mohammed has not been found at any stage claiming anything but that he had made a watch.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Muhammad, the police had confirmed that the watch looked like "film bombs".
The clock is in the police store, but it is known to be made up of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident happened on Monday and Mohamedia was sentenced to three days by forced school.
His father is angry with the case, and the American-Islamic Council of the country considers whether the case is once again one evidence of Islamophobia in the United States.
British Labour Director refuses to sing national songs
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen's garden, but Corbyn is the opponent of the monarchy.
The opinion of the right-wing press has also joined the members of Corbyn’s own labour party.
This has broken the people, said labour representative Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday, the British Air Force fought against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In his official opinion, the working party defends Corbyn and emphasizes his demonstration of respect for air carriers by participating in the opportunity.
We are all in great debt of gratitude to the heroism of Royal Air Force Air Force.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national song, the statement was highlighted.
Corbyn's choice as a party manager has shared the labour lines.
Especially among the parliamentarians are those who are afraid of the defeating of the Mediterranean voters with their radical views.
Corbyn supports one-sided alignment, stop savings and increases in public expenditure.
Corbyn is expected to be present today as a party leader for the first time in Parliament at the Prime Minister's questionnaire.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron won the election of Corbyn as a party leader on Twitter.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family waited for justice
The South Lake Minneton police have investigated the family death toll in Minnesota Greenwood soon.
The five-year-old family was found dead in his home on September 10 and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, a 45-year-old.
After first shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in a car house.
Deceased for days
The family was found after the school was worried about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house to check and found a huge house on various sides of the Short's family dead.
According to StarTribun, it is possible that the victims have been dead for days.
A Millionary and Successful Business
South Lake Minneton, Police Chief Michael Sitar, is still underway.
The motif of blood tests is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on AllNurses.com.
In the 2014 StarTribun interview, Short said there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
50 purchases have been made for me in the last ten years.
I have abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe at some point the company was sold, but not yet.
The success was, among other things, that Short's family bought a Greenwood emergency house for two million dollars in 2011.
The house is advertised by the property site in Zillow as a dream of a car hire: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a parking lot for eight cars.
Legal matters initiated
According to StarTribun, the family’s father waited for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering a variety of precursors, had challenged him in court due to comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, short's website had not removed pre-racing comments, and therefore they had lost their customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribun, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a significant impact on Short’s business.

And I'm holding my turbine, Loir stole it.
An amazing ele from the NHL star - "The greatest gift of all time"
Montreal’s Canadian superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital’s report, it is the largest gift of charity ever made by a sportsman in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to assisting the hospital in another budget for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canada eight years ago and $72 million.

Awarded to Subban, the hospital has been named an award-winning award.
Canadian players have previously significantly helped local hospitals.
A year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for the other city's large hospital to receive a PET scanner required in cancer studies.

Model world hard laws: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model of Manon Leloup wanted the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about a pure model.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine met Leloupin six hard truths behind the cults.
Every season starts empty.
Even though in the previous season you’ve been posing in the homes of top designers, the new season begins again with casting.
And every season in the industry comes new, fresh faces that compete with concassers.
The models rarely have a place to call them home.
The work is a continuous journey and can also take years to make the accommodation a hotel room or apartment in which the designers make their models.
If you are very young, and your mother can’t travel with you, solitude can be difficult to endure.
New York and Paris are desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not only one kind of weight.
Agent in New York may ask for a few pounds, but Paris says you're too heavy.
Get a job is a risk game all the time.
Fashion models and designers are all the time together, while working as a support network.
When the designs are over, the difference is uncomfortable.
Models want this area because of the possibilities it offers, but they are stunned by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities.
Work makes models feel that they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models at Tory Burch's show yesterday.
In New York, we are currently spending fashion designs where designers will reveal the next year’s model.
Roope Salminen is the most unknown musician in the movie
Roope Salminen presents the band’s founder Antti Lautalaa in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta group.
The board founded Apulan in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but separated from the unit in 1994.
This is a very big challenge for me because I am a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I present a 16-year-old guitarist, Salmine laughs.
I didn't want to meet the right Ant before the descriptions, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is obviously unknown to people about that crash, so I think it's quite good to teach his style of play only from a video.
I don't want to imitate man.
A very empty man with Roope Salminen and Dogs is not a source of a role.
The Punk Manners come from the man's nature.
The stars, stars in the punk season of the program will certainly have many seen the preview, as well as if it has ever happened on our cows.
Our presence has never been a little bit, but we always go full.
The Tuuka Temose, who played basso in the apple between 1993 and 2004, was published today by the main actors of the beautiful film.
The band’s popular nuclear team presents to the large audience young actors who are still unknown.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukkia presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tattoo Sinisalo Bastic Tuukka Temoka Iiro Panula.

The Roope, seen earlier in the week and in the leukoabar, has turned its face into siloposy, and colored brown hair into black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or should I tell you anything about it?
There is no need to talk to the poor, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not allowing them to look at the news alone.
Little children can’t always understand what they see, and it can remain in their minds and worry, he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news from refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking.
It is good to visit the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of the children may be surprised.
They may not be those parents who are afraid of him.
The child shouldn’t be afraid even if he’s worried and scared himself.
The younger child follows closely the behavior of his parents.
If parents themselves stay calm during the conversation, their children will experience their safety as well.
Some children are likely to talk about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them if they are talking about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world have good things.
Parents can, together with their children, think about how our family is treated with this.
But is the world, in the end, a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have a variety of educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as possible.
On the other hand, if a family is also talking about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This may be beneficial for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Learn your children to help weaker"
Your own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
Vermoon striking Ball Salama hard to hide
Perttu Nordola was broken to support the Apilan Balloon in the middle of the attack.
It only ran the wins and cakes, until at the end of July in the Tamperee Rivers was a collapse.
As the ori originally hit the base, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered to protect his veterinarian for a while.
The explanation for disruption survived in the event.
The horse had throat inflammation.
The disease wasn't less likely to get rid of it, but it needed two medications to get rid of it.
As Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, the North says she was positively surprised by the last horse race.
It was the second stage of the SE after the meeting.
Apilan Pallosalama was at very high pressure when it could normally drive only a few weeks.
This little trend in the end was understandable, the North says.
The coach assumes that the good competition has made it hard for the eggs.
The horse’s movement certainly went forward, and I hope it would also have been balanced.
Apilan Ball Salam has been the so-called humor.
When you haven't enjoyed it, you might have thrown it closer without any diseases.
On a good day, the worms have removed such a salama letter that the opponents have been wondering.
At high speed, the competitors cannot reach the Pallosalama, from which even heat-blowing flows.
The desires of the North have a pedestrian movement in Vermosa.
However, the difference is how Apilan Pallosalama agrees with it.
It's a very difficult time to get out, and maybe you'll get under the car's bump and it's like that.
Hopefully, ory would be more calm than at the time of departure.
Apilan Ballosalama will be able to come out of the neck as well, and we're going to drive that win, the coach's promise.
This is why you can’t get rid of the free iPhone software
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the future programs included in Apple’s iPhones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple is likely planning to remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, says CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed in an interview.
On Apple’s iPhone you can find a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Brush, Podcasts and Tips come in mind.
The latest add-on to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a compulsory update to your iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple’s smartphone owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple’s programs is more complicated than it looks off.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook notes for Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple’s iPhone apps work firmly together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like that.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating this because the company does not want to lose memory space from users on iPhones.

The average inflation in the 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 percent.
The largest of the euro countries, i.e. 1.4 percent, consumer prices rose in Malta in August.
Cyprus inflation was at the lowest rate of 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent, according to the EU’s harmonised price index.
The euro area’s inflation remains steadily far from the European Central Bank (ECB) goal, which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium-term.
The ECB will predict an average of 0,1 percent inflation for the euro area this year.
The rise will rise to 1.1% next year, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
U.S. Fed is trying to crush monetary policy
The next U.S. recovery will start at the speed of less than a year, but more likely than three years after the country’s central bank Fed will take a long time back to raise its interest rates.
In the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recovery.
The Fed has pointed out to start the crowns possibly already this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recovery can be pushed on its fastest by next autumn and as the financial market courses before it.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets are working as they have been used — and if they react to Fed's money supply as they have done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive research on long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributes over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international customers last week.
The research and report’s strategies do not believe they know when exactly Fed is starting to raise interest or what happens in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, with the help of the cold economic statistics and their calculations, they show how economics and markets have previously behaved during and after Fedin’s crowns.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what the key variables in the economic and financial markets are now in the same or in another model as in the past interest rates - and what it may result from.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better position to endure interest rate rise than ever since the 1950s.
It may not be the beginning of a year.
Fed’s monetary policy and its everyday motion leaders have been suggesting last summer and the beginning of the idea that it is time to rise up interest rates.
The first crown for over nine years can happen already this week.
The issue will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Board of Directors of Fed meets to decide on this for its two-day meeting.
Last time, Fed raised its Fed Funds management interest rate in June 2006.
At the same time, it ended two years that lasted relatively regular but at the same time a series of small 0.25 percentage points of crowns, with Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The phenomenon of the financial market began in 2007 with the difficulties of the United States' most risk-free housing finance, and a year later the financial crisis became a major global judgment day.
A great revolt occurred in 2009.
For the last time, serious conflicts between the financial markets and the real economy began slower than typically occurred after the previous Fed crowns.
Similarly, the experiments were both harder and harder than ever since the lap of the 1930s.
Deutschen’s strategies have been testing the rise and declines of the world’s largest economies, as well as the conversions of the financial markets since 1950 and have always been in place since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed’s crowns and their economic and financial impacts have been reflected since the 1950s.
It has spent its fastest time at the beginning of the first coronation less than a year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The price of the financial market has expired within two years from the start of the Fedin crowns.
The Fed has in turn raised and in turn decreased its control height to a thousand separate cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time it has differed from some parts of the other, and the times are relatively delicate in consideration, so on the basis of them it is hardly possible to conclude nothing certain of the effects of the following rates.
The strategy reminds us that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Rate is too low for too long
The critical reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be found to be found guilty even in decades of investigation.
But three factors of the crisis and its devastating causes are somewhat uncontroversially clear:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other world’s largest central banks considered their control interest rates too low for a long time.
They placed tracks of the technology plan, and at the same time raised the next.
2) Over the decades of the various parts of the financial and real economy, and even the excessive amount of debt of central banks increased even more from the impact of monetary policy.
There was the largest debt in economic history.
3) In particular, the crazy debt funding, which was mostly undergone in the financial economy, caused the most part of the financial market, from the largest curriculum of shares in economic history to real estate, debt books and assets.
Also, it is hard to argue that the increasing financial markets in exchange for increasingly complex debt funds were rarely in danger and instability, when the Fed and other central banks last dropped interest rates.
The funding structures in place of debt funds received values did not last as long as their time since the debt funds began and the costs of debt funding had turned to rise.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis, followed by a great recovery.
A larger coupon and more debt
The Deutschen strategies do not think of what will happen next, but give the subject of the injury by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for a long time, they have now been even lower for a long time.
2) Debt debt has not been crazy for a long time as ten years ago, but now the debt is literally cheaper than expressing.
Thus, the debt in the financial and real economy has not been decreasing, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt has been burdensomeer than before the financial crisis or half of it ever before.
3) The liquidity issued by former central banks as a smaller and cheaper liquidity has mostly remained in the financial markets and has decayed the key types of securities and assets to their most expensive ones, whether at the top or at any time before the financial crisis.
And strategies do not only have the financial market warning marks, but they also note that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the hardest trend to the model as it has been in the past.
The economy of the euro area has barely been recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusual weak condition but, accordingly, the pressure and risks of the financial market are unreportedly higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed is taking its funds on a narrower scale.
Perhaps the French Bank of the Societe Generale Strategy Albert Edwards’ future will not be as strange as it may suddenly seem.
He has already trained the Bank’s international investor customers in the following full translations of Fed:
First, the Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial plates will go out, and soon, it is time for Fedin to push off the financial sectors with even greater QE cashes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are focused on HP’s corporate service party, the company says.
HP will share in November with HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumer-oriented PCs and printers.
HP’s staff was the largest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, employees were arrested at 302000.
The company accounts for arrangements of $2.7 billion (about $2.4 billion) once-natural expenditure.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30000 employees.
The reduction of the consumer party will remain to 3300 within three years.
HP will transfer its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers no longer account for more than ten percent of its business revenue.
Another year, three of its most important customers brought 65% of their sales revenue.

General: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax paradise company
Minister of Traffic and Communications, Anne Berner (center.) has been a member of the government of the tax paradise company.
According to the company, it involves the so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo, whose government member was appointed Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself says he has left a statement of membership in May this year.
I've checked it, and it's enough that I've left a statement.
It is almost impossible to manage and verify that registration chains take place in an agreed schedule, Berner said in an interview.
Membership after the merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a parked producer who fused with Finnish parked producer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served in the Government of Karelia-Upoflor between 2010 and 2013 and after a merger in the Government of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, Kährs assets pass through a multi-portable asset structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yl that he received the government membership at the Luxembourg company Kährs on the request of the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the Hartwall Capital Government of Karelia-Upoflor.
The company was asked for a partner found in Sweden.
This company is owned by a capital investor who has a company in Luxembourg.
I realized that my duty was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the revenue of our Finnish companies capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point has been secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yell that Hartwall Capital's ownership does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex property structure imposed on the tax paradise is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs capital fund on Triton had already a luxemburgian holding company for ownership.
Reception centre in Espoo opens
In Espoo Otaniem, the first reception centre is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents from tonight.
The number of locations can increase within a week to up to 300-400 people.
The immigration agency establishes a reception centre for the property of the former Rescue Station.
The operation is maintained by Luona Oy, whose industry is particularly the provision of healthcare and healthcare services.
The city of Espoo, the immigration agency and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the safety arrangements of the centre.
STTK prepares an alternative work life pack
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for the government’s work life.
The system also hopes for other employee centre organizations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently in a statement on Friday.
Alternative means of reducing the labour price will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola noted a meeting of the organization’s administration at the pause to reporters.
Palola estimates that the Central Business Union (EC) is not ready for discussions instead.
The STTK economists have calculated that the change security contained in the government’s competitive package will cost an estimated employer EUR 30 million when the other side of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a lot of great passion for a discussion, if there's one relationship with one hundred.
Ball: The negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center.) hoped alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the government would then have to make a statement to the representatives of their own packages and start preparing for reforms.
Paul didn’t take a look at whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, a conversation with the government has existed, and it has been built by him all the time.
In the field of STTK, particularly on Sundays, the operation, according to Palola, is a painful place.
The system requires the government to withdraw from the forced legislation to implement some of the crash.
According to the STTK, Palola is not warming up to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP held in the case.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the labour life package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the wages of the first days of disease are cut, the overwork compensation is half-cut, the Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and the vacation is shortened.
The STTK stresses that central organizations have invited wage recipients to protest and have not been intended to organize the law.
Akavan Fjäder
Mr Sture Fjäder welcomes the STTK announcement for the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK will now be on the same lines with Akava, since the Akava has already been designated by alternative models for government performances for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package, as without the SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
President Sture Fjäder hopes to prepare the presentation as an alternative to operations, according to the future of the SAK led by Lauri Lylyn.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier Wednesday he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and work time banks.
The programme announced on Wednesday that it has long prepared its own presentation, which is ready to negotiate a five percent competitiveness target by the government as an alternative to cutting operations.
The program has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to consider the terms of service as part of the contract.
On the contrary, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that visits the country’s government and employers, Fjäder says.
The working committee will meet on Thursday at 5 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talkoot" - plays bingo when Sipilà speaks tonight
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingo coupon on the green left of the University of Tampere tonight.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the wars and the wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on the channels of Yle on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
In the previous Prime Minister's speech, it is necessary to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister in holding a famous radio speaker, which marked the beginning of the end of the cabin of Mäntsälä.
After that, the president and the ministers held several radio talks during the winter and future war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held President Mauno Koiviston instead of a New Year speech, but it was a more ceremonial.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped the train manager's law by televising.
Single calls, monarchists of mines
The speech of Sicilia has awakened the criticism of the whole day and the estimates of what it is supposed to be in the future.
The President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter, “Sipilä could hold a speech on the state of the nation in the presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.”
According to the Green Ville Niist, “the first call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
SDP’s judge Erkki condemned on Facebook that “the monarchist minds: the Prime Minister tells the people what’s best for them.”
SDP President Antti Rinne challenged Sipilà's dialogue: "After six months of elections.
There is no single presence of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of @juice?
Public Service
According to the Council of State, Sipil's speech is pre-existing and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, in the direct mission, it was commented by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC CEO Jyri Häkämies.
The public has been reviewed by Sipil's speech.
We have considered this and noted that the task of public service is to contribute to the full publicity of Finland, says Ismo Silvo Yle, head of publications in the news.
Like Me at the time of Tammeloid
The speech has also awakened anguish.
In the evening, dinner is enjoyed at a good time, the children are shaking and dressed in their best.
Mom puts on her necklace and her father agrees with her necklace.
At 9 a.m., the television is shine off as before in the time of Me Tammeloiden,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Is Prime Minister Zipilä also talking about why the Finnish government sits in the paradise of the tax heads of the Millionaires who have given other tax collectors' friends mercy laws and at the same time arguing that the people have to cut off when the money is over?" asked Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one opinion is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It has published a bingo next to Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the common coal, the living and the spirit of the team?
Coupons and pens are ready, at 21:05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahti Island in Guardian: Western countries fought Russia's proposal to exclude al-Assad
The Western countries fought more than three years ago the Russian offer that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have resigned from power, said President Martti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
The Russian U.N. Ambassador proposed a plan that al-Assad would be stylishly emanated of power after some time.
However, western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Russia's Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed him in a two-centre debate three points of plan: the opposition could not be armored, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately linked and the resignation of al-Assad's power had to be implemented quietly.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that he was sitting down, Martti, so I'll tell him what we should do, Ahtisar remembers the Guardian interview.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari tells him that he has transmitted the Tshurkin message to the United States, the UK and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshhurki did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but, according to Ahtisaare, there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on the claims of Ahtisara, but said that the al-Assad forces had already made several mass murders at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements that he would have remained in power.
The former director of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Middle East, Sir John Jenkins, faced doubts in the speeches of the Ahtisaara because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad at any stage.
Russia has officially supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in the statement of Ahtisaare is that Czechoslovakia spoke with Moscow’s delegation.
If he had told me about the Czechoslovakia talks, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also suspect in the case that it would have been Putin's intention to hold power with some of the supporters of Al-Assad.
Refugee streams of our own actions
During the negotiations on the island, about 7,500 people died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 in the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to escape from their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I don't see any other option than to take good care of these dirty people.
Now we're going to pay the bill we've made, Ahtisar tells the newspaper.
Asylum Applicants' Organisation Centre in Turkey
The asylum seekers’ arrangements centre, planned by the Government of North Finland, are likely to be set up in the Tower.
The center will be established in the center of the city with an empty building of the Tower Community Station.
The Ministry of Interior has searched for a suitable place to better manage the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki spokesperson said on Tuesday that the office had already decided to submit a school building to the ministry as a logical solution.
According to the Vice-President of the Tower City Council, Sauli Hyöppise (as opposed to this), this is not true.
When the whole delegation was not at the meeting and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the delegation's meeting to decide on Monday, he said to the STT.
At the meeting, 36 of the 43 were authorised.
The Arrangement Centre was opposed to 13 officials.
On the basis of this, you could expect the decision to be positive, Hyoppin said.
According to mayor Timo Nousiaisen, the city was unconnected on Monday, and quickly responded to the matter.
There are estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has visited to verify that it could be applied to such use.
The location is a pair of meters from the boundary, so it would also work in the mind, the Rising said.
Sipilä still hopes for the labour market alternatives
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), half-official holidays would only take part of the government’s goal of calculating the price of the work.
However, the government would like to accept the alternative package if labour market organisations manage to agree on this.
Sipilä told reporters in the presentation that he had not been involved with the labour market organizations.
He also did not know how serious organizations are looking for substitute means for the government’s reports on work.
If such agreement is made, we will receive it without any joy as part of the whole package.
Semi-sharing of the holidays would be a means of functioning by Sipil, as it would affect almost all salaries unlike, for example, the government's Sunday-like operation.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holidays because they have been registered in law rather than in collective agreements.
The Government will report on these views to the representative on Wednesday next week as a State Council communication.
According to Citizens, the proposals of the organizations should be known before.
This isn't the ultimate trick.
The legislative work then goes to the movement, the train is moving, and it goes harder all the time.
Now it's a good time.
It doesn’t take a long time in such things, if there’s a will, it’s a designer.
Last week, the list published by the government has, among other things, the turnover of the end-to-end and helicopter into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the wages of the first days of disease are cut, overwork compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75 per cent and vacation is reduced.
The reforms are carried out as a compulsory legislation for trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the Remuneration Centres organise a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political failures.
Tohma Lake’s Office approved the extension of the warehouse
The Tohma Lake's authority unanimously approved the extension of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy administration.
The fact that the project is larger and more expensive than it was initially spoken.
The busy schedule is also sharply.
It was also a little surprised that the need for registration was not known a year ago when the previous enlargement was decided.
At this stage, the extension of stocks by 400-450 square meters was approved in the investment programme, but the funds will be decided as more imported as part of the Annual Report.
At the meeting, we discussed investments of EUR 150,000 to EUR 200,000, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated to be EUR 300,000.
Investment was encouraged on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the local.
There is no risk in the municipality because the company is paying investment as a rent, Vesa Armistö (ps.) justified.
Among the languages of the cattle, Joensus
The city government relieved its strong position in order to import cattle-language street cultures to the center of Joens.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the election of a cattle tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not the capital of the cattle language because it does not have historical grounds and the cattle language is a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the area of Joenus has more belonged to eastern sausages.
After a new decision, there will be no cattle-language streets in the city centre.
Nevertheless, the city in Joensū is also ready to use the cow language, for example in information and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, the use of the cowboy language should be treated openly now, as multiculturality lives and changes strongly in North Karjala as well.
The language of the bird still has the specific characteristics of the province, as well as the imagination of Joensus as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be beneficial in the various district marketing.
Suspension of connections cuts the vitality of the county
The operations of connections strike the province's life force with a hard hand.
Movement links directly affect the country’s business and competitiveness.
And this affects whether it is possible to live and do work here, Joensuun, the mayor of Karjalainen wonders.
It also highlights the air traffic, which has also been graduated several times in the report.
It is important for the whole province that we do not be able to reduce our possibilities by means of governmental measures, as we are now taking place.
We should consider the effects of cessation of these transport connections, for example, on employment, as Karjalainen emphasizes.
The deterioration of cost connections causes an additional challenge to the University of East Finland with regard to attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the director of the University of East Finland Jukka Mönkkönen notes.
He notes that bad traffic connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment chief Marko Junkkarinen says that marketing of the university towards West Finland is already difficult because traffic connections are weak in the divergence direction.
Students at the University of East Finland currently, about half of them come out of East Finland.
About 10-20 percent of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train.
One of my songs came to the Siun War.
The view of the Joensu city government on the Siu War project is apparently unanimous, but one of the sora sounds is.
Pentti Centrisalo (sd., picture) presented the entire project to the government on Monday’s meeting, but his proposal was unprofitable.
The Government adopted a draft decision by the mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the meeting of the municipal council, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train trip Kotkasta Kouvola ends next year
Personal transport from Kotkasta Kouvola remains in the future, although one train pair is less rare.
There will be changes between Kotka and Kouvola in March.
One pair of trains remains, but still five times a day arrives at Kotkasta Kouvola and vice versa.
Conditions are due to state savings.
For the next four-year period, the ministry of traffic and communications will be reduced to EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely terminated.
VR will set up new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force 27.3.2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one didn't come down, the boys climbed out of the place.
The rescue agency rescued a 12-year-old who did not get his own help from the roof.
The situation was born in the Tower of Ketoth at half an hour on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no trails to take to the roof at all.
It didn't stop a boy's team who decided to rock the roof of the house along the radio amateurs near it.
The other boys came down the same path, but one didn't.
As a consequence, the rest of the crashes and the passagers warned the rescue facility to help the tractors safely return to the land’s surface.
FedEx's business gain is double, calculating fiscal year's 2016 views
FedEx reports depressing results from the last quarter, reducing delivery residues from the results forecast throughout the year, due to the decline in demand for cargo services and the higher costs of its land services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share decreased approximately 2.5 per cent in the call shop 45 minutes before the opening of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the end of the next year to end in May to $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to FactSet’s survey.
Less views came despite the average 4.9 per cent rates that will enter into force on January 4th, and despite higher additional fees in the country transportation of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said it expects business profits to grow from the previous year, as they have cut costs, turnover has grown and online trading is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "is steadily growing, taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
The labour plans for the holiday were announced a day after the UPS competitor said he was going to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, as much as he hired last year.
At the end of August 31, the FedEx result was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which remained from an average estimate of $2.44. The survey of 12 analysts was carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analytics expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international transportation priority, which has stopped the development of its Express unit.
However, the rise in online trade has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the revenue of the land unit increased by 29 percent, but the revenue of the operations was basically the same due to the cost of larger packages and their own insurance.
The Express unit’s income was better due to higher basic fees, while the sales profits in cargo operations decreased higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening season, FedEx shares dropped $3.85, i.e. 2.5 percent to $150.15.
FedEx closed on Tuesday 11% of the fall for this year and 17% below the record on 11 June.
The U.S. Central Bank’s executives are sitting this week around a huge stomach table for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it has been time to raise the control interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
On the other side of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, Chairman of the Central Bank, and his colleagues must place the national economic interests in the first place.
The Congress has reduced the dual responsibility of the Central Bank on the charts: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after a large lap, the heads of the Central Bank have agreed that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it can not even be predicted. The decision on whether the U.S. economy is ready to be hosted by a recorded incentive factor, which has been held by nearly zero from the end of 2008 to the short-term import.
Although most of the information demonstrates a stable growth in the economy, the recent defeat in the global financial markets may have made the already reserved central bank officials more sustainable, which will result in increased instability.
“Comprehensiblely, labour markets and inflation are the first and most important aspects to be followed,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, Stifel Nicolaus & Co.’s chief expert on business.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a legitimate interest rate for themselves, increased uncertainty in the world market has a sufficiently qualified reason to wait," he said.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been agreed, which already creates nervousness to the economy.
According to Bloomberg’s recent survey, about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets are still expecting the central bank to delay the rise, as, according to the key indicator, the possibility of growth is only about 30 per cent.
This refers to a decline in the securities market, if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers will then be able to soften the attack by promising that the next increase will not occur soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 percent, with a new chapter of 16,599.85.
The rescue brought together the expectation that the central bank will keep its level in advance this week, says John Lonski, chief expert at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, “they must see a lot of effort in their line to support the financial markets so that they don’t get panicked.”
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty from when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would increase the interest rate at a quarter-percent unit this month, taking the first small step towards a slow breakdown of the monetary economy, which would certify the stability of the U.S. recovery.
Since spring and beginning, he has confirmed that he expects to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals require more economic development in their complaints.
While the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.5 per cent last month, at least seven years, and close to the level that the Central Bank considers to be a full-employment limit.
Growth of wages has shown signs of swelling.
While inflation is still below the 2 percent annual target of the Central Bank, the central bank’s decision-makers say that this will have a temporary effect on a significantly low oil price.
“The economy is also known as the highest interest rates and also needs them, taking into account the strict situation in the labour market,” says Ian Shepherdson, chief expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China devalved its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index dropped up to 16 percent of its May records, as investors feared China's slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the May’s top experience.
For the central bank’s market leaders, myllery is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells why interest rates are to rise.
“Without these financial market events and recent news about the weakness of China’s economy, the decision-makers would break the level at this meeting,” says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers are waiting for at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
“The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear and they have little information on their behavior as to the consequences of China’s events,” said Oliner.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concerns of the Central Bank, so it should not, in principle, affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become a world monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been unfair.
In 2013, then President Ben S. Bernanken, suggested that the central bank could "reduce" the amount of money, caused deformations in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly growing together, central bank officials are expected not only to develop the next development elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, the head of the global strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank, located in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "the Central Bank has previously overreacted the movement of the financial markets that seemed to have been separated from the economic fundamentals."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voted member of the Committee, is an example of decisions 1998-99.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable impacts on U.S. economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the Central Bank cancelled these operations.
The central bank should prioritize economic stability only during the major crisis, as when the markets broke in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Corona Settlement Committee.
The last myllerry will not get closer to its level, Posen notes.
"Nobody wants to be in a situation where interest rates are scared because the market is disrupted," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act (Federal Reserve Act) still holds a double requirement and does not mention economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I think they should not be predicted.

Brazilian breastfeeding organization in Rio Grande announces a healthy diet for breastfeeders
The Brazilian breastfeeding organization SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition as a breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies in the cute breasts, which have painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increase in calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should do.
A recent study led by Texas Baylor College of Medicine by Robert Waterland revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genetic manifestation and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven-channel Sunrise program is your favorite viewer in quantities, despite Nine-channel companies to update the management revelation in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson have failed to add Today's audiences to the later announcement of the leader of the Liberal Party in Canberra.
The nine-channel morning program was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull took control of Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, produced by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of its week-long series of international missions, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The mass of the outermost wasn't feeling disturbed by Australian television spectators, as Sunris' average value was 397,000 in the five state capitals, when Today's number was 339,000.
Today’s average increased slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today, Sunrise has been arrested over the past few months.
Today's average in August was 318,000 and Sunrises 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, in September, Sunris has an average of 349,000 viewers, with Today’s 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event all day.
The winds are going to blow this morning anywhere other than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa can do well, thanks for the question!
Posted on Monday, September 14, 2015
Seven-channel great news was the 800-word series, which featured the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, a stunning first show.
The new drama series, which has collected an average of 1,219 million viewers, tells about a recent widow’s father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have wondered whether Thomson's popular series will be able to hold power alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibneyta.
Last night, the results gave him real certainty.
The seven-channel The X Factor was its strong favorite of 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838 000) and the TBL Families (726 000).
Seven channels had two destiny on the second night of the Chase Australia series.
The first half hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe’s new show collected 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) scored 623,000 viewers - which was a small enough win for the Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the Chase Australian first half-season spectators had an average of 520,000 spectators, and the second half-season had an average of 720,000.
The average Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australian second night’s average viewer’s reduction brings Nine’s channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program that failed to reduce the number of McGuiren's program viewers.

The final trio agrees with my fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may be wrong to reveal who wins the Bachelor series.
Her woman's identity has been kept secret with Sam Wood to join in The Bachelor.
The remaining three girls don't really miss who got the last rose.
Nevertheless, while we talked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before three of them became two, they could unwillingly give a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's Lips Behind Thursday's Final
All three women were thrilled to tell them how Wood was a perfect man mentioning his mood, ambition, family value and positive reasons why they would like to be his partner.
But when they were asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, to whom should it go?”, their reply could provide a revelation of who won the boy’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markossky quickly referred to Mackay as the best alternative to Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been unsuccessful since the first day.
"Since the moment I went into the house, (Sarahin) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind all the time," said Jeavons-Fellows.
“Sarah is really a landlord, and it’s fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood agreed well.
Mackay said that last week's home feasts made him realize that Wood could be "this right."
"When I saw her with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - now I'm with all my heart here," he said.
When asked who Woody should choose if not him, Mackay was worthless.
“I don’t know how to say,” he said.
I like the rest of the girls as much, so it's the equation between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 19.30 at Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has a lot of options to start his NFL
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his shift to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about his day of open training after the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayn for the end of the game after this Australian rugby league had fallen the ball in his first flight return when he won the Minnesota team on Tuesday reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Haynen to return the next flight and took her to the race game after Reggie Bush's injury.
The real nature of Tomsola also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of putting his new revenue into a stake in front of another team, he would encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in the post-game press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped an airplane hit by Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
This wasn't really the start that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished for a man's NFL debut.
Haynen was seen roaring on the way from the field after the fall, and later she told the Australian radio pair of Hamish & Andy 2DayFM channel at the 104.1 frequency that she hadn't been able to imagine a worse start on the NFL uranium.
“It was just one of these things now, you just need to think about the next game and it’s there,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared her acidification to her Origin debut in 2007, when she entered her own painting area leading to Queensland painting.
It was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne has been possessed in a photo published on his Instagram account with fans rather than Australian tickets.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a threatened weapon on the Siberian gratitude path.
Hodorkovski was openly questioned by President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was reversed and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 police killed in shooting rubber products against demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in a police force shot rubber products in southern Nepal, which had suggested against the country's new constitutional proposal, the authorities said Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandeh, about 175 miles to the west of the capital of Katmandu.
The region’s senior official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 protesters were gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and firefighters.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before he dropped on rubber products.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber cloths known to have been killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The meeting was in violent demonstrations in the last weeks across Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group requires its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent interviews, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement that divided the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal with a central administration for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake of April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the provisions of the Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter won will be adopted by Sundays.
U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC says Cape Verde has a 60 percent chance of roaring
The low-weight breast, located about 560 km south of the southern part of the Kap Verde island group, has a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical circle in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The second precise low-speed breast, located in the middle of the Kap Verde Island Group and the Little Antillies, also has a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical spine in the next two days, the Miami weather forecast center has increased.
Google starts a donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) released a donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million to humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees come to Europe when they escaped from war and from poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective in its publication on its donation campaign blog.
Rather than having made the announcement, a director wrote his own personal experience by Google’s employee Rita Masoud, who fled from Kabul with his seven-year-old family.
"Our journey included numerous dark trains and buses, as well as hunger, hunger, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
The gifts will be received by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children, and UN Refugee Chief Executive Officer.
Google has said that it is equal to the donation made on every worldwide google.com/refugeerelief site for up to $5.5 million, so that the total goal is $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis has been in Europe since World War II, and it is mainly the cause of Syria's four-year civil war, which has driven more than four million people from home this year.
Many have also escaped the war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss can help mildly overweight diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss from type 2 diabetes mellitus can take at least five years.
However, it’s still too early to say whether these slightly obese diabetics live longer after a weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than by surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss expert who wrote the headline for a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss, i.e., in bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach bag.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Within years, bariatrise surgery has been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the people involved in the study have had diseased weight, and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The weight ratio to length is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the BMI is over 30, it is considered to be excessive.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of barian surgery, abdomen transplantation and abdomen reduction, for type 2 diabetes treatments in people who were mildly overweight.
The study showed that the average BMI of those cut down decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, those who were treated in other ways than by surgery, BMI remained at the top of the same level in 29.
36% of people who are cut from diabetes are totally cured, and 28% are partially cured.
Due to the comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved entirely only by 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, as well as "bad" LDL collector "obsessed generally in a better surgical group," the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored blood hemoglobin A1c levels of patients that reflect blood sugar levels in the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should be less than 7%, researchers write.
After surgery, hemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9 percent to approximately 6%.
In the medical treatment group, however, it remained stable by approximately 8%.
This better "glycaemic control" described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years, said Chih-Cheng Hsu’s colleague.
The study group also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, when compared to the gastrointestinal reduction group, the gastrointestinal reduction group had decreased more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased more weight indexes (7.4 and 5.1), decreased more percentage of hemoglobin A1c levels (16.4 per cent) and achieved more percentage of hemoglobin A1c levels (16.1 per cent and decreased to diabetes (complete) and 2%.
The University of Arizonan College of Medicine-Phoenixin Blackstone says that although research does not appear to have survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to a longer life in the heavyer people.
The Swedish study found that overweight loss patients had a 29 percent lower probability of death in the 15-year period compared to the group that had experienced more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement to the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraged for people with BMI under 35 and interested in surgery.
“The results of the research are crucial in the fact that they show that surgery is safe for a lower weight index group,” he says, “and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the stage when the BMI is between 27 and 30 patients.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that constantly prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to revoke the situation.
"Everyone can't come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees by adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet Buddhism has called for the cessation of violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of its ten visit to the UK. The centre is dedicated to ethics research.
Dalai Lama argued that in the present situation, the needs of all humanity should be placed in front of individual nations or even paintings.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admirable, it is also insufficient.
“Everybody can’t come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
While Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for action in the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
“It is great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, especially through education.
The main thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their country.
We need to reduce power use.
Power use has never solved these problems,” he added.
Taking its position on the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after 9/11 terrorist attacks and argued that the U.S. violent response caused chain striking events.
"After the 9/11 attack, I presented my share in the letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem is found through the non-violentness.
I know that his motives were good, but he used power and created unexpected consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, child's hand-infectant melting has increased to four-left
Intoxication data centers across the U.S. have reported a strong increase of nearly 400 per cent in alcoholic hand-infecting necklace for children under 12 years of age since 2010, the Georgian poisoning data center said.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, head of the Georgian poisoning data center, the cases of disinfectants reported to poisoning data centers in children under 12 years of age increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are interested in these products more often and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them is due to the polarization," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant with a purpose, while some want to influence their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
YouTube has videos in which teenagers drink disinfectant to get cheap rise.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic water to get stronger drinks.
The smells of a pleasant disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think that's bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (hands) are those to which aroma has been added.
There are mercury, vineyard, and orange disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant of the hands may contain alcohol from 45 to 95 percent.
Especially in small children, only a few injections are needed to get alcohol poisoning.
"It's really tied up alcohol," Stephen Thornton, director of the Hospital of Intoxication Data Center at the University of Kansas, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn’t leave a whiskey shoe on the table, but the hand-infectant will be left visible, and if your children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who had only four injections of pencils in hand disinfectant at school, and she was taken to the first tree.
His blood alcoholic level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit of adult racing drinks, says first-clinical physician Chris Ritchey, who treated a girl in the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of the Atlantic.
Nahaijah spoke to him and couldn't walk when he came to the first tree.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate hospital for possible brain injuries, because alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhajah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
The situation could have been a killing for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and transfer disinfectants from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are combined with deaths.
In 2013, two women of Otanria died in the hands of a disinfectant containing a toxic, uninformed ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contains methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which has been declared an active ingredient.
In January, three quarters in the north of the state of New York planned to toxic their teacher by spreading bacterial poisoning into the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the desinfectant and bans its class.
Police have to prevent the plan as a "pronounced rupture" and leave discipline action to the school circle.

Hearts fights against the Scottish Football Union against Neilson’s accusations, and Warburton is reserved for the paint of January that can disturb the team’s unity
Dons grew its lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first half-time punishment took Aberdeen's close victory at the Hamilton Pittodris Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths disrupts speeches about contradictions
The Celtic's internal conflicts have emerged, but Griffiths immediately listened to them. He argues that he and his teammates do not have any sense of work under a more precise look when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch series leader.
I think we're not under pressure, I think players are waiting for a meeting.
The lack of Scots' championships gets tired of the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition with Rangers.
The current Ambassador of Ajax, de Boer, said, "In the Netherlands, there is no longer a show of Celtic games, and why?"
Because Rangers are not involved.
People here don't just talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and they're interested in it.
There are lots of tensions in these teams, and other than the Scottish people want to follow these games.
Deila swears to turn around the situation
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss swears to turn around the situation.
The loss of Malmö and the consequence of the Champions League quickly followed the loss of ten men playing for Aberdeen, now at the top of the series, unlike the next five points.
However, Deila said, "The Celtics have had bad episodes before, and we're going to rise again."
Now we just want to get rid of this situation as soon as possible.
I know that this is disappointing and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we have to go on.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is reserved for players' transfers in January
Although the Rangers poem Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible items of January, he is reserved for the most colorful conviction that he does not want to confuse the consensus of the team.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transition window is very different from the summer window."
As for future players in the summer, the time of adjustment is all-time, which will be seen in our team this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more harm.
Celtic’s interest destination Michu suggests retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name is connected to the transfer window to Celtic, has suggested that he can retire after his agreement with Swansea has ended.
A 29-year-old player has been in a nickname for two years and has failed to find a new follower outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football League for Neilson’s comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The Red Defence Card was later deleted, and this was the third red card already convicted of Collum, which was deleted in the last eight months.
Neilson remains behind his message saying, “I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernians became a notorious singer of the former Hearts player Rudi Skacelist after his song was awarded.
The incident occurred at the pub in Edinburg Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"This was a derby and it was a moment's headquarters," the attacker added, "It seems safe to say I don't go back to Tynecastle if I don't move to play Celtic."
Tannadice government believes in Dundee's United leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still believes in the ability of leadership teams to turn the situation around, but admits that the degradation of players must end.

"We're gonna get the kids back," Donnelly says.
McInnes Happy to Win in Hamilton Game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty was able to achieve his seventh regular league power that raised them to the top of the table five points above Celtius.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it's a pokal or a league that wouldn't have won games in this way too."
Scotland’s unemployment remains the same as the UK’s growth in the whole century
In Scotland, 164,000 people remained in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK increased to a total of 1,82 million.
Scotland’s unemployment is 5.5 per cent higher than the UK’s 5.5 per cent, according to the National Statistical Center (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 people over a period of three months, and the number of workers is now 2 612,000.
Scotland’s employment rate decreased to 74 per cent during the quarter, which is higher than the average of 73.5 per cent in the UK.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented: “The long-term plan of the government is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost precisely a year has passed since Scotland made a historical decision to remain part of Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has decreased.
Why I testify of execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, I will later see how a man is executed today.
If so, and I hope not, I'm sitting on the watchman's press at Oklahoma State Penitentiary, watching Richard Glossip being executed with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started shaking this day when I approach it.
So why did I agree?
I bought it because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are chosen through a scary value.
Oklahoma has reduced the locations reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever is chosen, the event looks cool.
I can't do that.
I’ll be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I’ve also created my own contact with him through the calls made over months, and a two- and a half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I shouldn't have a notebook and a pen to save what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist on Twitter accused me of sharing my impartiality.
Here's the teaching.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he wants you to participate.
I chose the reporter.
He admitted that he could have put his word better, but he still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of my statements and things I wrote.
He will not tell me what I should write, and he will not do that even if he says.
I told him he could get me out of his witness office at any time.
But he wants to have an international journalist who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity helps to oppose the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about this, you can listen to the podcast broadcasts I made in the series.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would, in any case, make him guilty of aid.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that the proof of the death penalty was not sufficient.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And this is the point of view from which I see him dying.
I can't claim I'm totally partial.
There will be other journalists who take care of it.
You'll give me a description of how it feels when the man I like dies unnecessary.
The man was pulled out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt
Canning Valen's commander stayed dry when he pulled a man out of the Canning River.
The company of a man from Perth, who was tolerated by the police, went to the point when he found himself in a low, mutous water only a meter away from a policeman who tried to "draw him mildly back to the beach".
The police of Canning Valen were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday because of an unauthorized infiltration.
When they found a suspicion, this attempted to distort them by directing them to the Canning River.
But he didn't get so far.
"He stood in the water saying, 'I'm not going out, I'm coming to take me'," said senior Lieutenant Lieutenant Shandell Castledine.
Commander Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to break down, so he used a safer tactic: "the state of the police competition".
“Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape,” said senior Lieutenant Castledine.
Champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins rejected his car to avoid a collision and tried to swim over the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired locals to start the design of a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims suppliers tried to spy him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria’s suppliers tried to move their security deposits to his stock last year, threatening to stop the competition immediately.
He accuses suppliers and Racing Victoria's donation department of the claimed they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tata due to the treatment of the day-to-day was the last nickname.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has become in a difficult situation after the unexplained unexplained cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue crispy with regard to spying for a year and a half, and didn’t want that “it would look jealous.”
“I didn’t mean to say anything about it, and I’ve been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so tired that everything will break off at once,” Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with punishments, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk the head up and I want the owners to think that I will do my best in front of them.
When they begin to think differently, then I don’t have to continue as a coach anymore.
Then I have to consider what I do for my license.
In the past, Moody tipped a bomb in an interview on racing.com, where she told him that the non-defense department had attempted to spy on her stairs.
"Twelve years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man - namely asking him - and offered him a job in my warehouses if he provides information about what I am doing there.
They obviously think of me as a fraud.
If so, they should be separated from their lawyer, because they have failed in my arrest.
Robert Roulston, the former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is going to be personal?
Did Victoria Racing finally decide to marry and perhaps transfer responsibility to other than coaches for what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt that what I'm saying now is likely to make them think about it.
But now I am at that point, I don't care anymore, and it hurts me.
It really hurts me.
I want them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s disturbance has grown with a long-term cobalt study of Lidar, and the late rejection made him realize that he could “will throw his license over the table.”
Moody, the best known for the training of the invincible master Black Caviar, has called the rules for day-to-day treatments "to be" after the mushroom or sweat is placed on the horse's legs, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees failed to knock it on the leg.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, just like it was.
It was that day.
Moody may have a three-month competition ban on the basis of the funeral day treatment, with which the suppliers started the investigation.
That's a joke.
People who have created these rules do not know anything about horses.
“We all understand that the rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Cobram’s transportation passenger detained
Police have arrested a man who was accused of trafficking after he cracked his cyclist on the weekend in Cobram.
The bicycler was transported on a flight to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he was received serious injuries when his car hit him on the Murray Valley empire on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver had gone away and did not stop helping the wounded cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathaniel joined the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of stopping in an accident, denial of assistance, and other traffic violations.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobra is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in press releases
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has also criticized the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team's tacks would be part of the "line".
Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters coach, said that the "pressure" of Storm would be allowed to separate judges on his own side, when he suddenly won the final tournament in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely hid his reference to Storm after he won North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening at the final tournament. Bennett called the game "exhibition window" and said that two Queensland teams were "in-printed".
Bellamy defended his team’s tacks and said they were just focusing on “contact” tacks.
Bellamy added that his trust added two leading coach criticism to Storm, because it means they are afraid of losing their team.
“This is always going to be a speech – I haven’t heard about Trent Robinson’s pressing when we lost them 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or technologies all year round. In the last six weeks we have just pushed contact on taxis, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and he has apparently a great team to train, so he probably hasn't been used to lose, and so this was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this will always be talking about this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's training St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "excitingly".
Wayne is talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare the Saturday night game with our Friday games and tell us how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember how St. George often criticized him for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play a rugbya that we think is exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
You want to play such a game when you have the types of players.
He brought it in half in 2010, now he wants everyone to play in his style rugbya - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to be played like that.
I feel more confident when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us as a response to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roosters was more striking than played between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but how did it end up? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more paints but is it exciting rugbya?
Or does it make it exciting to break the defence line and leave the paint without it?
It's about lines for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm has been free this weekend because they have already won the right to play the home game against either North Queensland Cowboyse or Cronulla Sharkse at the prefinal on Saturday in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbs $200,000 warranty for a sweat
A man threatened by the potential lifetime of a 40 cocaine nickel ownership company transferred to Queensland has been released against a $200,000 warranty.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 pounds of drugs to the Solay jail that came through the South America's Ownership in August to Coomera.
Maksimovic was met with other accused in the boat for the entire night, and then met them in the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic threatened the potential lifetime of a cocaine owned company intended for business, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to keep the entire amount in possession and that he might be in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was worried that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place he lived.
Maximovic's mother and father had offered together a $200,000 guarantee to ensure his release.
“With the conditional evidence of both persons, it is clear that imposing a $200,000 guarantee is a real financial burden for them,” said the judge Flanagan.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from being in the face of justice, he warned.
Maximmovic has been granted guarantees provided that he will give up both Australian and Serbian passport, inform the police daily and keep in custody of his foreign movement language between evening and evening.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone asking for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl asleep on this phone and then entered the online communication service where Hogg received numerous non-smoking images of children sent by another user to her.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing, and found it asleep in Hoggi's hand.
The girl looked at her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, explored the computers in the area, and found "care-rival" web searches using the searchwords that were used to search for non-cigarettes taken from children.
Hogg later argued to the police that he had done this to "attrace pedophiles" on the internet before he "excuse himself to be a police officer to scare them."
Eilidh Robertson, spokesman of the Fiscal Depute, told Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said it was addiction - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had been buried on a computer but said that they had been done just because he wanted to make him a police officer so that he could cut the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with a stranger who sent him pictures, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional pictures.
Hogg said that he did it just for intake purposes.
He said that when he drinks, he's sick, and he wants to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found pictures of her phone, she cried out to her mother, filled and wept.
Mom saw homeless pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg in Dunde, Ward Road, confessed his accusation of making or taking pictures of non-smoking children on 14 June last year. He broke his warranties on 25 January this year and left the court without hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence Attorney Gregor Sim asked Hoggia not to be marked in the sexual criminal register because he could claim that he did not belong to a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal delayed his judgment on October in order to have time to prepare background reports.
Hoggi was granted warranties in this case, but in other cases he was arrested before the trial.
He was added to the sexual criminal record before the date of his sentence.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe said the wrong speech to the parliament
Africa’s oldest leader Mugabe fell earlier this year at the headquarters of the spokesperson.
He did not injure, but the video described in the fall spread the virus on social media law.
The open parliamentarians also rejected the arguments of the opposition legislators that they had been sent to unnominated murder threats warning them not to bow to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they bowed down and stopped him by the intercourse when he held a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said text messages to their mobile phones received seven opposition policies warned them not to disturb Mugaben’s speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responsible, but the title of the message is 'dead'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant Members that the immunity ended in Parliament, and when they come out, the parliamentary immunity is not valid.
The group's supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "care" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has reserved to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its reorganization and cost-cut efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will divide itself into two exchange-listed companies, separating its computer and printing business from the fastest growing enterprise hardware and service functions.
Expected jobs bring about $2.7 billion in spending from the fourth quarter, the HP report said.
“These reorganizations allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a range of services that will help companies move to a new business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our opportunity to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it “concentrates on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions” to companies, according to the company’s newspaper.
Jake is a division of a company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduates from Stanford University in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a car in Palo, located in the Alts, called the "Pila Valley Place of birth".
HP has been through a huge reorganization to overcome the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the field based on the belief that strictly limited companies are doing better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to support injured Jack Wilsherea before Dinamo Zagreb’s game
Wenger has also emphasized Wilshire that it is now only September and assuming that he is going to go through his rehabilitation according to plans, there is no reason why he wouldn't play again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire remains at least four of the next England games, and taking into account his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The greatest regret in this last problem is that the end of the last season of Wilsheren was a strong after a single necklace, and he remembered his old rigidity before the beginning of the season.
“This injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that hasn't improved properly.
It's not weird.
It was just an accident.
It does not relate to her nails or to the previous injuries she had.
This can be considered true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, the player trying to get back through, there is always the risk of additional deficiencies.
There is also an uncomfortable model formed.
Research from Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five season, he played Arsenal's 157 League games in just 65 games.
Looking at the wider Arsenal total after the 2007-08 season, for six seasons it has been one of the other teams of the Valioligan who have lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility, but Arsenal believes that their last season’s healing will continue.
“Sometimes when recovering from the injury can be an exaggerated season, so you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get it over.
I hope that his body will be established, I am sure that this will happen, and that he will make a career as he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, after playing Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspuri on Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be initiated.
Wenger can also place Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monrealin and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep a balanced and give a chance to those who want it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up of the F-lohk, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is the most terrifying of Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 matches since they produced their own "Unwinning" campaign in the last season.
The stadium was irritated on Tuesday night by a earthquake with a strength of 3.2 Richter's degree.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned about the condolences of the Champions League against Monaco last season, and he is motivated by the still distant rash leading the team to the victory of its first European Cup.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but, on the other hand, we could be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not hackers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is clear how much similar descriptions are not available in series, especially when it comes to the need for men to open up more desperate than ever, and the suicide numbers of young men over fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 year for men, aiming to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking assistance when needed.
Friendship is the core of this challenge.
The recent study included more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, the chance of a person to recover doubled, if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends were "healthy."
Likewise, those who have not been depressed, the likelihood of occurrence of possible mental health problems has been reduced if they preferred to have healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
Within the time of communication, the style goes through content, and the immediate response is often more important than a relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, even though isolation actually dominates.
This face-to-face success is governed by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens at the expense of internal values - an internal detriment to personal growth and friendship - which affect deeper our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money will certainly not get greater happiness.
Frendi's greatness was just that it turned the head of this focus.
No character defines their work, but rather their personality, which clearly separated in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous mischiefs, moments in a comfortable seat looking at football, Ross missing Rachel - the humor of these became aware that yes, men can resemble all of this, even though they often doubt to explore their emotions completely.
As the volunteer of the Samaritans organization explained to me: “When I hear people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understand how small the interaction with a friend can improve the feeling.”
Often, men who get in touch with us experience that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcome" is strong, as well as a feeling that if it opens to problems, we will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that come into mind when I try to offer longer ways of survival.
It emphasized small moments of friendship between men.
While an unparticipated, external position on the other side of the phone helps people in moments of discomfort, long-term support comes from a close, personal family network and friends.
And so if you participate in Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the descriptions are redesigned to honor the party, why don't you spend your friends in Central Perkin coffee?
Or even better if you see someone lonely, smiling and greeting in Starbucks.
You will never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frendis will be sent at Comedy Central at the end of all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes painting and helps PSG to move to the side of Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates paintings against Malmö with Blaise Matuidin and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria made a painting in his debut of the Master's League by helping PSG to pass the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Under the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League game with a 2-0-winning match against Malmö on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
In his debut, Di Maria made a painting under four minutes, showing the French Champions the way, but the team lost several possibilities before finally increasing their journey at the Cavan strike at the 61st minute of the painting.
Paris, which is in the same section A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish Champions League because the game was not only a continuation, but also an improvement in the last three rounds of their quarterfinals.
But even though PSG took points, there was no classical game, since Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place in front of the painting and was later exchanged from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he began his great career in 1999.
"In the Champions League, it is not easy to win at home or in the home, so 2-0 wins create problems for the opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, although there are things we're going to have to go through this season," Blanc said.
This predicted good.
We wanted to win and win, even though we did not manage to do one or two more paints.
Abrahamovic returned to the Paris team after three changes since the team stayed at the 2-level 2-level Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux for the weekend, but remained in the shadow of Di Maria for the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, he was named a man who took PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why Marco Verrat's intake was caught behind the Malm’s defence line and then hit the beautiful finishing of Johan Wiland’s rear network.
However, if someone expects PSG to make a big and easy win, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a great opponent. It won Celtic's solution to this level, in its opening camp there are nine international players and the defence of the visa prize, and two players in the deep midfield.
But the team did not offer much more on the side of the attack than in the 34th minute of Nikola Djurdjic's raid, which passed the nip through Kevin Trappi's paintings.
Instead, the PSG was shortened due to lost inputs and poor finishing, particularly Ibrahimovic, who failed in the five companies in total only in the first half and was deceived after Cavani put the ball into contact with Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in performing his colleagues, and just after Ibrahimovic’s death, Di Maria sent a tournament, which cost around the 52th minute of Wiland’s painting.
The second paint was finally obtained after an hour after the game, thanks to the sixth season’s paint of the Uruguayan Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had slipped forward from Maxwell’s crossroads to the left.
There was an end to Malm’s desires to go back to the game, and only Wiland’s great fight against the direct kidnapping of David Luizin kept the end numbers low before the exchange became Ezekiel Lavezz painting was completely rejected at the end of the game.
Malm coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was equally higher than his team. The Norwegian said, "The last game of our Master League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
The hardships aren't enough.
I'll pick up the hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for sale of shares
The Swiss mining industry, Glencore, who suffered from a pricing change in basic goods, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debts plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new stocks for about 1.6 billion pounds to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is fighting with the prices of ruined basic goods, as the slowdown of the Chinese economy bursts on demand and causes destruction in all markets.
The new marking increased the value of Glencore’s shares in London at the top of the stock exchange on Wednesday morning stores.
The shares increased by 2.77 percent to 131.60 penny in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had revealed last week, as part of a broader $2.5 billion stock trading plan to cut its $30 billion debt for about a third.
The company sold a new share capital with 125 penny, which meant a discount of 2.4 per cent on Tuesday’s decision price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, worth a total of 9.99% of the unit.
You're concerned about the long-term standing of China's growth has lowered prices by iron to approximately half, and at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other goods have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
White House strengthens Xi Jinping’s visit to Washington
China’s President Xi Jinping will make a public conference in the U.S. at the end of the moon, confirmed in a statement published on Tuesday.
Xin's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's last visit to Beijing, the statement said.
U.S. President and President's husband Michelle Obama will organize X and his wife Peng Liyuan dinner after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"President Xin's visit gives us the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China in a number of common interests in global, regional and bilateral affairs, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to debate constructively on issues with disputes," the statement added.
On a visit, which was first published in February, Xin is expected to diverge on his journey to Seattle to Washington before he continues to New York City and the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged networking and the increasing uncertainty of the country in the disputed South China Sea.
Matt Damon Reduces Difference in Film
Matt Damon joined Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown in their discussion of the differences that Damon said are not required behind the scenes.
In HBO’s Sunday evening at Project Greenlight, an experienced actor stopped Brown’s attention to the necessity of different perspectives regarding the project’s chosen script to the dark main character.
“When we talk about differences, it will be taken into account when choosing actors in the film, not in the series,” Damon said.
Injured Brown reacted incredibly injured, comments "Oh! Wow. OK," while The Martian's comments left out.
Other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series of finalists.
“I want people to think about whatever directors are, how they treat Harmony’s personal harmony,” Brown said.
The only dark character is a bitch that his white partner hits.
The Dear White People’s producer called for the rights of film directed by finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon boringly replied that their guidance “may end giving us something we don’t want.”
When the discussion was sent, social media exploded Damon’s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger on the film title by writing: "Matt Damon is talking to the only dark person in the room and explaining the difference to him is NIH'S BLACK that is injured."
After its publication, Twitter collected more than 5,000 restarts and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments are a moment when an accurate racial presentation in the media is in front of the social debate.
After the White Police Killed Teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter Movement spread to a global scale and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop colorful people discriminating practices.
In February, the singer Prince was referring to the release when he presented the album of the Year as the winner of the Grammy Award.
“The albums are still important,” he said.
Like books and blacks, the albums are still important.
Black Lives Matter’s leaders recently issued an opinion to answer Fox News TV grandfather Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question of whether the group would be considered a hostile group.

First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professionnel rapper and rapper Isaac Caldier became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and won a prize of a million dollars.
At the end of the seventh period, there has never been a competitor who would have surpassed the estera of the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero, and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
In the last task, a 23-meter thickness had to be stirred in 30 seconds.
Britten first climbed and discovered the challenge at the time, which led him to become the first athlete of all time to find out the 4th of American Ninja Warrio, but Caldiero solved the challenge for three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win, and was still shocked to win a million dollar prize.
“It’s great to think about it when I’ve never experienced or lived as much as $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his great wage rise.
So suddenly... so I can even imagine how this is going to be... the future is unknown.
Producer CEO Kent Weed sat down to talk with The Hollywood Reporter about the finalist and why Britten would not get more awards even though he was the first competitor of all time to get through the rail.
According to the rules, the money goes for the fastest person.
"When more people go through, money gets the fastest time," Weed said.
While money is a great award and changes life, it gets a feeling of great satisfaction.
I don't think he's feeling so good for it.
He's just so happy that he's done what he's done.
His fans praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family father.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to win me, I'm happy that it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way, if this would have gone differently.
The American Ninja Warrior will return to the eighth season, whose descriptions will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers hippie Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season has not been quite fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played their polluter role perfectly on Tuesday when he won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field field.
Twins lost the chance to rise to the top of the game in the Houston Astros competition from the second American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was at least one night returning to the six-writing pair of H-sanna, which had been very difficult to achieve most of the last half of the season.
“All wins are fun, regardless of how they get,” Tigers’ team chief Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers invader Alfredo Simon continued his early attack back when Detroit ran three times in the first two rounds, then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 of the pair and rescued three runs.
This was only his third quality in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong ending for this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard for an alternative to eat any game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' deputy robber Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first hit after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three shots in the evening after he hit the Seattle Marines four times on July 6.
"He's gone well," Ausmus said.
She looked good (in the shooting exercises), looked significantly better in the shooting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The twins were three runs behind in the last half of the seventh hill, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Sentter Byron Buxton started the hill by shooting two times out on the left side of the field line.
Aaron Hicks came home with one sweater, and Simon was burned directly by another sweater player Brian Dozieri before Simon was switched to the left to Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauritius, the only player to be set up, by Miguel Sano, an initial deputy player, who would run two wings to the left of Drew VerHagen.
When two runners were on the field and a flattening runners wash, VerHagen received a three-washing Trevor Plouffen to hit a double-leading painting.
This was a series recording: the 27th time this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received a security run in the ninth initiative, Mauer would run two hits against Tigers' lock Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the real-time player burned the Word in three shots in his fifth rescue.
Detroit used Phil Hughes at first.
Tigers won three runs in the first two pairs against the right-handed veteran player who got out of the list of injured before the game was out of the inflammation of more than a month.
“It’s obvious that I didn’t want to start like this,” Hughes said, “but in the game’s progress I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I had a third pair of pleasant inputs.”
After Hughes picked up the initial lion for the first washing, he gave the second washing to the player Ian Kinsler to move forward one.
In the case of J.D. Martinez's two-fire walk, Victor Martinez, who took himself to the middle of the field and caused the game's first race.
Victor Martinez would break his 0-21 runners in good running stations.
Triangle player Nick Castellanos continued to shoot at the right and cause a second race, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected while trying to move on to the triangle.
Tigers continued in the second round and received one fire, two fires in the situation, the run was pulled from James McCanni and two fires, one fires in the situation, the center of Anthony Gosel, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important strike," Twins team manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feeding boxes and put an unleavened third hill, after which he became the right-hand continuer A.J. Achter.
Three runs were calculated for Hughes on six slopes and walked on four balls.
NOTE: Tigers’ right-wing intruder Anibal Sanchez was dismissed by his shoulder injury.
He was investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured since mid-August because of the shoulder crash, but he had to return on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is out there, the left-wing driver Daniel Norris comes from the list of injured people to start against Twins.
Norris's statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in the four initiation after the left-wing driver David Price was exchanged for him on July 30.
Norris has been outside since August 20 because of the stomach muscle toleration of the right wine.
The Tigers and Twins three games series will end on Wednesday on the Target Field field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota's right-hand feeder Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for a broader open economy to the world
The economy needs to be more helpful to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday to the group whose task is to guide reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign finance and expertise and to develop transparency policy," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to deepening the reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are driven to further new movements and vitality, as well as creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list of market access restriction, the finding of border inspection principles, the relocation of state-owned undertakings to private capital, and the revision of the system of resident registration.
According to the opinion, there is a negative list of sectors and undertakings in which they cannot be invested.
The system is gradually tested and improved using experimental programs.
The change must be noted, as it gives the market a greater role in targeting resources, ensuring a legally-based business environment and making the market more transparent, according to the statement.
The government also finds its management on the power it divides to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide themselves how to manage their businesses.
The opinion also said that China would allow cross-border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth development.
In order to open public-government sectors, more sectors are open to private funders.
"The government does not change its line on foreign investments, and it will protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, the search process for permanent residents of foreigners, "green cardies", is facilitated by optimizing requirements and relief of the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of lawyers' training rights and the support of professional judges and attorneys.
