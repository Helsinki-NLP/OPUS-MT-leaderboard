The Welsh House members are concerned that they will be seen as “the play tent of the night.”
There are concerns among some of the Members of the Council regarding the proposal to change their title to MWP (Leave Parliamentary Deputy Welsh).
This concern is because of plans that have been proposed to change the parliament’s name to “Parlamen Wells”.
Members of all political sectors are worried that this will make them joke.
One of the Wells Board members says his group is worried that “MWP is also caffeine with Twp and Pwp.”
In order to inform the readers outside of Wales, it should be said: In Wales, twp is a stupid Adam and pwp is a defence.
One member of the Plaid Party says that the group is generally not "real" of the nomination and has proposed other options.
One member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is acting on the change of the name “roschefnerically”, but it also pointed out that the word MWP to the Muppet dictionary “the play tent” is near.
In this context, the first word Wales means w is pronounced similar to u in English Yorkshire.
The Council Commission, which has already drafted a draft law on the change of name, says: “Of course, the final decision on any title with which members are appointed is an important issue for themselves.”
The 2017 rule of Wales gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public opinion on proposals that were widely supported by Parliament Welsh.
As regards the designation of the title for members of the Board, the more Commission wants to be used as "Wells" or WMP but MWP option is further supported in public co-option.
Members of the Council seem to suggest alternative options, but an effort to reach an agreement can be made up of the President of the Eleanor Jones meetings, as he is expected to draft laws on these changes within a few weeks.
The amendment law will include other changes in how the Council works, laws relating to the rejection of the power of members of the Council and the design of the Committee system.
After parliamentary negotiations, the parliamentary members will vote their final parliamentary votes on a particular title with which they will be named.
Macedonian people vote for all questions about changing the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country’s name will change to “Northern Macedonian generality” or not.
The voting of the people in the direction of an invitation to resolve conflict for decades with a neighbouring country called one of the provinces of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the country's northern neighbours is a claim to be his president and has repeatedly objected to the proposal for Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President George Ivanov was opposed to all the presidential elections and said he would not be willing to vote.
However, fans of all questioning, including the Prime Minister Zaran Fake believes that this change is a cost-effective name that must pay for joining the European Union and NATO.
The Church of St. Martin was shut down, like Harlem.
Mr. Adams: “In historical terms, the elders who talked about it always had a drink and a church in every corner.”
“There is no one today.”
Mr. Adams says it is understandable to lose a burden.
He says, “The idea of people’s society is different.”
“Most people are no longer a village where people go regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is worried that money from sales of assets will not last until the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will get back to the point.”
He added that apartment buildings may be replaced by a church where people do not help in the remaining sacred space.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white in the skin, so they go on the day the churches are closed, because it is far from the majority of those who move to these apartments to be members of these churches."
The two churches were built in 1870 by the White Society in the middle of the metropolitans and the Church of Martin in 1870, before Harlem became a black town.
The main white group of skins that had a meta-religious religion resigned from the city in the 1930s.
The Black Society of Skins nearby, where they worshiped, considered a new title for the building.
St. Martin was admitted by the Black Society with the leadership of Priest John Howard Johnson. This Priest was the leader of the sanctions of street shops on the 15th Street, which was the main shopping street in Harlem, resisting recruitment or recruitment of the Black Bridge.
The fire occurred in 1939 was severely damaged to the building, but when residents in Johnson’s neighborhood created reconstruction maps, they also ordered a series of calls (Carilon).
Priest David Johnson, the son of Johnson, and his life in St. Martin, called the band “the songs of the poor.”
A specialist who examined and voiced these sounds in July calls it another thing: “A cultural genius” and “a non-substitutable historical tool.”
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also believes that this was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black-leather writer Dionisio A. Lind and moved to the Riverside Church 18 years ago to play a larger carillon.
Mr. Merriweather believes that St. Martin has not replaced anyone.
What has been published in St. Martin over the past few months has been a complex plot of the mouths of architects and covenanters, some of which are created by the Church’s readers and some by the Bishop’s Church.
The Mathematicians of the Prayer Room – the governor of the Church’s area consisting of non-spiritual readers – wrote a letter to the Bishop in July and made their concerns based on the fact that “the Bishop’s Church was not seeking to transfer their expenses to the Prayer Room.” Although the Prayer Room was initiated by the Prayer.
Some church members complain about the lack of transparency from the church.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked and injured during hunting for a kidnapping.
According to officials on Saturday and the beginning of the cattle hunting season in California, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamle said in an interview with KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was kissing with his friends on Saturday morning, hearing the boy's help after half an hour and immediately swimming with a group to him and helping him get out of the water.
Hamle describes that he was initially thinking that the son was excited to take the expense, but then he realized that he was shouting: “He took me!
"They've been kidnapping me!"
Hele said when he came to his son, “all his defeat was opened.”
He said, “I have made them all come out of the water, “it is in the water of the cake.”
The boy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was placed on a list of people under conditions.
I don't know what kind of attacker was.
Larry Giles, Captain Guard, said at a media meeting that a cow had been discovered in the area a few weeks ago, but it was clear that it was not a part of dangerous species of cow.
Giles added that the victim has suffered injury and injury in the upper area.
Security research authorities prohibited access to the sea for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Kazabul to Trinity in Assisi.
There are more than 135 species of chickens in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sanzbury Chain Store Designs for Entering the UK Makeup Accessories Market
Sinzbury is a chain shop and has risen to compete with special manuals in the field of cosmetic accessories with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores.
As part of a remarkable effort to enter the market of cosmetics worth £228 billion in the UK, which is still growing (while the sale of fashion products and household products is declining), the sealed cabinets of cosmetics will be tested in more than 11 stores across the country and will be developed in the future.
Investing in cosmetics offered in a supermarket are searching for ways to use the wardrobe space that was used for television, microwave and household accessories.
Sinzbury said it doubled the supply of cosmetics and produced it up to 3,000 products that included brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw at the first stage.
The ranges available from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with brand locations similar to those found in shops like Boots.
In this boutique supermarket, make-up accessories will be redistributed so that most plant products are friendly - a subject that is increasingly pursued by young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance’s fragrance store will also be exclusive in two Sanzborn test stores, which will open its first store last week in Crayon, South London, and the second store in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Buying online and changing the way to buy low daily foods in local stores means that supermarkets are forced to try too much to convince people to go to these stores.
Mike Coppache, CEO of Sanzbury, says sales markets are generally increasingly similar to chain stores, and supermarkets are trying to deliver more services and non-food supplies to combat discounts in Aldi and Lidl stores.
Sinzbury has built several Argos stores in hundreds of stores, as well as several Habitats stores, because it bought both chain stores two years ago and said it has strengthened food sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previously attempted supermarkets to add a cosmetic and pharmacy to fail.
Sinzbury tried to create a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but after a not so serious effort, how to distribute revenue in the chemical store was problematic and co-operation stopped.
The new strategy was launched three years ago when Sanzbury sold its 281 pharmaceutical store to Celesio, the owner of a Lloyd’s chain pharmacy for £125 million.
Louise said it would play an important role in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury brands in the field of skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Miles Hicks, CEO of Sanzbury, said: “We have changed the environment to improve our customers’ appearance and feeling in cosmetics cabinets.
We also hired special co-workers and trained colleagues who will be there to provide advice there.
The array of brands, given the need, and a comfortable environment and location means that we now have a beautiful and guided place that challenges old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones has become angry after the Holly Wiloby deal has made 11 million pounds.
Peter Jones, a serial actor in Dragons Den, after a television tournament, released 11 million pounds with his trade names and decided to close his new contract with Marks, Spencer, and ITV with anger.
Wiloby never has any time for household clothes and accessories under the name Truly.
The company is a brand similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The “morrow” program has announced on Instagram that it has left the deal.
Hallie Wiloby made Peter Jones angry at the Dragons series because he rejected the last moment of the trade with his trademark - to focus on new contracts with Marks, Spencer, and ITV.
Resources say Jones when the Golden Hair TV girl on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlo, Buckinghamshire, has accepted her new transactions - worth up to £1.5 million - meaning she has no longer been angry enough time for Truly branding that is on the field of household clothing and accessories.
The company has found the brand Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, which is said to double Willow's wealth worth 11 million pounds.
In this way, 37-year-old Viloby announced in Instagram that he had stopped contacting Truly and Jones also left Britain to one of his Icelandic homes.
One of the sources said: “Truly was really one of the Hollywood priorities.
It will be the long-term future and will be together in the next few decades.
His decision to cut off all of them.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, until the start of the work was unexpected.
A warehouse full of goods in the central office of Marlo is ready to sell.”
Experts believe that today’s “morrow” outlet, which is one of the most polluted stars in England, can cause millions of damage to the company due to the heavy investment of a company in products including cousin and candles to normal and domestic clothing.
This can be the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, a mother of three children, and her husband "dan Baldwin" had a close relationship with Jones and his wife "Tara Cape" for 10 years.
Willowby founded the Truly company in 2016 with Cape, and Jones worked on it in March for 52 years as the head of the Board of Directors.
These two couples were together and 40 percent of the Balduin TV production company’s shares were in possession of Jones.
Wiloby wanted to be M&S business ambassador and replaced Anthony McPartlin, who was an ITV program manager called “I am a selfie.”
A source close to Jones last night said, “We will not comment on his economic affairs.”
It’s hard to say “and then we fell in love.”
He believes in media criticism to write that some don’t know it “in the president’s office” and also did not consider it positive about North Korea’s leader and made it a joke.
Why does President Trump leave the matter so early?
Trump says with a funny voice:
“I didn’t leave anything.”
He reminded them that Kim (Northern Korea’s leader) was pleased with Trump in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which is a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear weaponry.
But the negotiations have stopped with nuclear weapons.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, Northern Korean diplomats said they would not see the North Korean “controversial reaction” by the United States to advance the weaponry in North Korea.
He noted them instead of the U.S. with the aim of maintaining pressure on sanctions.
Trump had a very nice view for his fans in his embarrassment.
He said, “Our work with North Korea was great.”
“We were going to war with North Korea.
In this case, millions of people were killed.
But now we have a great relationship.”
He said he had his efforts to improve relationships with Kim’s positive results – ending missile tests, helping freeze groups and restoring the remains of the U.S. forces to the country.
And he also defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
Trump said, “It’s very easy to be president, but instead of 10 thousand people trying to get themselves into this compressed space, we have about 200 people standing there.”
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake caused the destruction of an island and the deaths of hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake of Lombuk, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that they do not need it.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombard population were homeless, the national disaster that was necessary to accelerate international aid was not made.
"In many cases, it is very clear that the application for international assistance is not done and therefore it is a little difficult to do."
While the child rescue group is gathering a team to travel to Palo City, they are still unsure whether foreign workers can work in those areas or not.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesman of the National Failure Agency, said Indonesian officials were investigating the situation in Palo to see if international organizations could allow to help or not.
Despite earth movements that are constantly happening in Indonesia, it should be said that the country is unfortunately not too ready for nature's anger.
Sonamic refugees are built in the valley, but on the coast there is no news about these refugees.
The loss of sonamic warning in Palo or even a normal warning was also one of the causes of injury.
In the best way, the move between many Indonesian islands is a challenging job.
The natural disadvantages are harder.
A hospital ship located in Lombuk to treat injured people is on the path of Palo, but it takes at least three days to arrive at the location of the accident.
President Joko Vidodou has taken steps to improve the old Indonesian construction that was the axis of his electoral logos and has spent the highest amounts on the road and rail.
But the deficit of the government's budget will face problems in the next year's elections.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from group conflicts in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have accepted a religious conservative form.
Christian bands and Muslims in the streets, using tops, knives, bridges and other cruel weapons, have killed more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands of homeless people.
Watch: Daniel Steering, Liopole player, prevented his team from losing against Chelsea.

This shock went from the top of the penalty station to the right of the gate.
The ball was rejected on the door of Mr. Kepa Arrizabalaga and finally made flowers.
Steering told LiverpoolFC.com: “It was just a try to get the right position to take the ball and play a player like a lobbyer as much as possible. So I tried to create a position as much as possible for myself.”
“I saw Kent coming and shadow hit the ball, he didn’t think much about it and just took your shot.”
Chelsea, after its 25-minute flower, Eden Hazard, won the first half of the game to zero.
The blue attacker, after turning near the semi-field, quickly moved to the semi-Liopole ground and crossed the ball back to Matthew Coach.
Coach put the ball in the middle of the field and moved himself.
Then, with a beautiful deep shock, the ball reached Hazard inside the penalty court.
Hazard put the defense in place and cut the ball on the side of the opponent with the left foot that was thrown from the door of Mr. Alison Becker.

The crammole is the oldest memory to be hit by the "historic basonism".
Its consequence is the poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban many of the British cultural and religious works that have been committed by the admirers of the Pyrenees religion.
However, the Crimeal Association described Mr. Craig's proposal as "excited" and "rewriting history."
John Gladsmit, Chairman of the Association of Kramoll, said: “The discussion is now inevitable to remove the sculptures of the Oliver Kramoll that are outside the West Menister Palace.
The defeat of the British domestic wars was not an order, nor was done by Crimea.
Carmel may have been a victim in the past century in violation of the law and replacement of his grandfather Thomas’ actions.
The superb show, which William Hammo Tornicroft has provided from Cramole, is evidence of the 19th century assumptions and part of the history of a character that many believe is still to be analyzed.
Mr. Goldismit said to Sidney Telegraph, “Cramul has been considered by many people who might have been more than today in the late nineteenth century as a defence of the Parliament against foreign pressure.
Whether this is a totally accurate show, it is a continuing historical debate.
What we are sure of is that the conflict in the mid-19th century formed the next development process of our nation and is a well-known character that represents one side of it.
His achievements as a defender of Lord also have the value of analysis and memory.”
A pig killer with a whistle causes the death of chinese killers.
According to local media, a pig was attacked and killed on a market in Southwestern China.
According to the South China Morning newspaper, this man was identified only by the Yuan family while his criminals were cut off and bloody in Cape Town near a pig in the Lebanon market in Guizhou Province.
On 30 May 2005, a pork farmer was prepared to inject pigs in the vaccine.
According to the report, he entered the city with his uncle from the Greek neighbouring country to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his uncle's son realized that he was dead and the neighbour's pork is open.
He said there was a large pig in the pigs with his mouth bleeding.
According to the report, a legal medical examination confirms that the pig has attacked 250 kilograms of pigs with sweat and caused it to die.
According to the Guang newspaper, the murdered cousin named Woo, said: “My uncle’s fathers were bleeding and roared.”
Security cameras show that Yuan has entered the market on Thursday morning at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His father was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed this man does not belong to Greek or to his uncle's son.
One of the market managers told Age newspaper that to prevent attacks on people, the pig was closed and at the same time collected evidence from the police scene.
The Yuan family and market officials are negotiating about his death.
Before that, the incidents of pig attack on humans were recorded, although it was rare.
In 2016, a pig in the state of Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband on their farm and injured a man.
Ten years ago, a pig of 90 kilos had been thrown into his tractor to scare his wife and remove the animal.
After an urgency cowboy was eaten in 2012 by his pigs, a Manitoba cowboy told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but taste and blood taste can act as a pig.
He said, “They are only actors.
They get gas and are very curious ... they are not outside to hurt you.
You just have to respect them as appropriate.”
Rainfalls caused heavy rainfall in Southwest America

Nevertheless, in the coming days, the rain will lead to rainfall in the north and southwest of the United States.
The storm of Reza, which is part of Class 1 storms with a 137 km/h speed occurred Sunday morning at 5:00 p.m. in the east of the United States, and its location is located at 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Reza is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
At the same time, low-pressure waves will begin to calm down on the ocean and move towards the east and western coast of the United States. By approaching Reza on Monday in the form of a warmer storm to the Southern Peninsula of California, heavily warmer moisture towards the northwest southwest of the Pacific.
The rain is caused by rainfall on Monday in parts of Mexico to 250 millimeters.
Then warmer humidity in interaction with low pressure waves will lead to heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Rain 25 to 100 millimeters of rain is a local rainfall that causes a sudden dangerous flood of water flows along with bulbs and possibly earthquake in desolation.
Heavy heat rainfall will increase in some points, especially in the southern parts of Novada and Arizona, to 50 to 75 millimeters per hour.
It is expected to rain in parts of the southwest, especially in many areas of Arizona about 50 to 100 millimeters.
Depending on the nature of heat rain spreading, the floods suddenly occur and the situation is rapidly getting worse.
Due to the risk of rainfall, it is highly recommended to self-drive walking.
Heavy rain causes deep valleys to turn into rugged rivers and storms will cause rain along with dust.
The rainfall will cause severe local rainfall in parts of Southern California.
Rain is more than 12 millimeters of rainfall, which will result in the flow of water along with the floods and decay of roads.
This will be the first regional rain in the wet season.

In October, we see severe temperature changes throughout the United States, because the northern pole is cool, but the heating area remains completely warm.
Sometimes this situation leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday, a great sample of temperature differences will occur throughout the U.S. central sector.
There will be almost 20 degrees of temperature difference between the city of Missouri and the Omaha state of Nebraska and St. Louis and the 10-months state of Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat will remain at the end of the summer and will rise again.
Many central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have warm days in the early October, and in the south to the northeastern parts of the air temperature will reach 27 centigrades.
The temperature of the city of New York on Saturday may reach 27 degrees Celsius, which will be approximately 6 degrees Celsius higher than the average amount.

More than 20 million people watched Bert Cawano hearings.
More than 20 million witnesses on Thursday through six television networks presented him evidence in the country's Supreme Court by Christian Blasi Ford about a sexual abuse of Bret-Cowan, alleged in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political opposition continued and the broadcasting of regular television programs until the last minute on Friday: a deal designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake with the FBI to investigate charges a week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he was 100 percent confident that Cowan was in his immediate state and tried to bring his clothes to the high school party.
Kavanaugh says 100% is sure that this hasn't happened.
It is likely that more than 244 million people have seen the incident reported by Nelson on Friday.
The company has counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC news channels.
Statistics and figures for other networks that showed this event were not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox trading networks.
Neilson is usually not able to count people who were watching the program in the administrations.
In order to analyze the subject, it should be said that the size of conversation is almost equal to viewers of a football game or awarded a Oscar awards.
Neilson said the Fox News network, whose refugees strongly supported Cuban erection, had an average of 559 million viewers that were from all other networks.
ABC had a second position with 376,6 million viewers.
According to Nelson CBS, NBC, MSNBC, and CNN, they had 371 million viewers, 284 million, 289 million, and 252 million viewers.
The audience’s attention and interest remained after the meeting.
Flick played the main role on Friday's show.
After the republic’s office announced that it would vote for the benefit of Cuban, CNN and CBS showed him on Friday that all opponents went to the elevator of the court.
He stopped with depressed eyes for a few minutes while others were embarrassing him, and the scene was being broadcast live by CNN.
A woman said, “I am standing right in front of you.”
“Do you think you tell the truth to the people of the country?
The man said, “When many women cannot, you are powerful.”
Felix said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator was closed, he wanted to tell more things at the committee hearing.
The cable networks and broadcasting programs covered this matter when the strong judicial committee was involved in voting to the Cautano candidate in the Senate.
But Flick said that he did this only by understanding that the FBI would appeal against the candidate for the next week, being supported by minority Democrats.
Felix, after a conversation with his friend Chris Kuons, who is Senator of Democrats, was convinced.
After a conversation with Queens and several other senators, Felix made his decision.
Felix had the power to choose, because it was clear that the Republicans could not vote for the approval of the Republic without research.
President Trump has requested the FBI to launch its investigation into prosecutions against the Cawano.

I was a witness of the crying of my parents because they could vote, but now we have been sick with Ben.”
Despite the management of its vital victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties were unable to continue their movement in the current year, many of their famous leaders are detained or detained and are waiting for a change in their role in organizing and declaring independence.
Hun Poig, a 42-year-old mechanist, who is supporting the police with a telephone of film demonstrations, said that this was the difference between politicians on both sides of Ben Ben.
He said, “It is more and more.”
On Saturday, Oriol Jancoiras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who took over the temporary arrest since the late last year, announced that he will participate in European parliamentary elections next year.

Alexander: several men were arrested during the destruction of a house with a car
Three men were arrested at the age of 33, 34 and 39 after they dropped their car at a house in Lindri.
The incident occurred on Thursday at about 19:30 p.m. in the United Kingdom in Balinese of Christchurch.
Detective Bob Blooming said the injury has been invaded by the doors and the building itself.
At some points, a car is also shot by a driver.
Mena has made Livingston 1 to win the Rangers' team on zero.
The first flower of Dali Menga guaranteed this team to win Livingston.
Lewingston conquered Rogers and Steven Gerard won his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Aburex Club.
The flower of Dali Menga has made Livingstone to be higher than the hibernants.
The team of Gerard hasn't won the top league outside the house in this season and will play with the team of Hertz with eight points on Sunday.
Earlier, Rogers will be hosted in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, with Holt coach, who was killed by Miller last month, increases his inseparable defeat to six games.
Livingston lost his chance against his guest.
Holt's team worked before the attack on the flower, and their direct shocks led to troubles.
Scott Robinson defeated the row of defenders, but his effort remained inexpensive against the flower, then Allen Litgef was only able to turn his shoe open to reach Craig Hallett along the flower.
The host team was happy to play against the Ranger team and knew that they could be struggling against the team in parts of the game.
In this way, they were able to touch that vital flower.
The owner of a strike was released, the ball from Gallacher and Robinson arrived in Manga, and he also entered the door from the middle of the crime center.
Up to that stage, Rogers had the ball ownership, but the defence of the host team was incomparable, and the door of Ben Liam General worked mainly without mistake.
The process continued in the second half, although Liam Kelly was able to stop the ball from Alfredo Morlos.
Scott Pittman stopped by Alan McGregor, Mr. Rengers' gate, and Laitgef also hit out of the leg for Lewingston.
The strikes of the parties were continuously driven towards the Livingstone Crime’s court but all were paid. The Rangers team was filed twice - once after Hacket mistakes on the player replaced Golden Medellon and one due to the ball contact with the hand.
"Superwork" Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, Scottish BBC reporter from Tony Macaroni
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
I think they were very great, but they still seemed better than expectations on this rising path.
Their game style and destiny have changed very little after returning to Oge, but the main pride is that of the Holt that has pushed it out after entering the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket was great and organized the defense very well, while Mega was able to fail Connor Gladssan and Joe Veral.
Although the team wasn't busy.
As much as they were good at Gerard’s time, they are now away from these standards.
They had no final finishers - they were only able to open the host team's defense once - and this is a warning for the Rangers who are now in the middle of the table.
Dual welcoming from Erdogan in Cologne.
On Saturday, September 29, Turkish and German leaders met together in the blue sky of Berlin with a smile.
The last day of the debate with German President Erdogan, which aims to reform the relations with NATO allies.
They negotiated together on issues related to human rights, freedom of press and membership of Turkey in the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new, very large mosque.
This city has placed the largest population of foreign countries in its own country.
For security reasons, the police prevented the gathering of 25 thousand people in front of the mosque, but a lot of fans near the mosque came together to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents – many of them – began to default, and the policies and decisions of the German government condemned him to accept him in the country.
Two opposition groups demonstrate the opposition between two non-German Turkish groups, which recognize some Erdogan as a hero, and others call him a rebellious ruler.

The road is closed and the bus route has changed and drivers are advised not to move from this area.
Long-Lartin prison officials: Six agents injured in the flood.
According to the prison office, six prison officers were injured in a high-security jail for drinking.
The shooting at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire occurred on Sunday at 9:30 a.m., and continues.
Specialised Tornado officers are engaged in fighting the drinking of eight prisoners and in a rounded corner.
The officers were treated as a result of partial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Trained and specially trained employees are settled in HMP Long Lartin.
Six people were injured by the workers who were treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that wrongdoers are sent to the police and may have left behind for more time.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, some of whom are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison president was reported to have been transferred to the hospital after a prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, anti-insurgency officers were invited to jail to deal with a serious bowl, and in this bowl, workers were attacked with billion balls.
Suddenly threatened floods in the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit from rainfall)
This is a rare issue of reduction in Estonia’s pressure on Arizona, but this is exactly the same thing that is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, i.e. the remaining energy of the floods of the southwest desert and the sudden risk of floods.
The National Weather Service predicted for Mondays and Tuesdays in the west of Arizona to south and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Philadelphia, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is predicted that Reza will move its path to Phoenix on Saturday and rain there late Monday.
The National Airology Service in Phoenix has noted that “secondly ten turbines have been caused by Estonian storms or low pressure in about 302 kilometers of phonics since 1950!
The storm of Katrina (1976) was a storm at a distance of 65 kilometers of the state border of Arizona.
The latest models of the national storm center predicted the rainfall of 50 to 100 millimeters, which also reaches 150 millimeters in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rocky mountains and the large rooftops, it is likely to rain more than 25 to 50 millimeters, which may totally be up to 100 millimeters.
For areas that are far from the sudden floods, rain may be beneficial because these areas suffer from dryness.
Although the floods are very serious, it will probably be useful for some of these areas because the southwest region is currently experiencing dry conditions.
According to the weather.com site, more than 40% of the Arizona regions in severe drying conditions have a second class of intensity.
Initially, the Reza storm route is towards the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Reza is still a storm and is at the maximum speed of 137 km/h on Sunday morning, 602 km/h from south of Punta Eugenia Mexico, moving north at the speed of 20 km/h.
The storm continues to face the colder waters in the Pacific and thus decreases its power.
So, it is expected to show its power in the afternoon or Monday night in Mexico.
Rainfall in various parts of Mexico can be severe and the risk of flood is significant.
Weather.com reports: “The total rainfall from Baja California to northern Sunora is 75 to 150 millimeters, which may reach 150 millimeters.”
Reza then moved in a warmer storm from Mexico to the north and at the early hours of Tuesday morning, the low-pressure area reached Arizona border and will move late on Tuesday after passing Arizona to South Utah.
The National Storm Center reports: “The main predicted risk of Reza and its remains include severe rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sunora and Southwest U.S. Desert.”
These rains are expected to create sudden and threatening flooding in the desert and earthquake in the mountains.
Attack in Madsmar Norton: Four suspects were arrested for murder
After a 16-year-old son was found in Samaria with a knife injury, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for misconception and murder.
The teenager in the Excelsior Terrace area was found in Norton on Saturday at 4:00 p.m., while injured.

Trump says Cuba is angry with the Democratic Party’s “people and anger”
Trump said in his speech in West Virginia’s Wiling State: “Ray is to vote against the judge of the Kavanaugh to reject the wicked and the tactics of the innocent Democratic Party.
Trump says that during the process of his nomination to the election of the Democratic Party, Kavanaugh was annoyed.
Kavanaugh announced on Thursday, before the Congress meeting, that the allegation of Christian Blasi Ford, which is a claim, was rejected by Kavanaugh decades ago and during her adolescence.
Ford also witnessed his claims at the hearing.
President Trump said on Saturday that “Americans saw Kavanaugh in brightness and quality and courage that day.
He said to many of his fans in western Virginia: “Ray was approved by the judge of Kavanaugh, voting to assert one of the most famous legal experts of our time, who is a legal expert with the history of all the goods in public services.”
While the president talked about the importance of the Republic's participation in the interim elections, he said it was televised on behalf of the Republic.
“Five weeks are one of the most important elections in our lives.
He said, “I’m not in the elections, but I’m actually.”
That’s why I’m in this place and I’m fighting for the big candidate.”
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is “a great resistance and an obstacle to traction.”
A GOP senior adviser predicts to CNN that the first vote in the Senate will take place on the Cautano candidate until Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquakes and tsunamis, and there seems to be increased injuries.
The officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami occurring on the Indonesian island of Soluzia, with very large waves on the coast of many people being slaughtered.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered to attend a festival in the city of Palo, which suddenly took up the waves with a height of up to six feet (18 feet) and dropped them and destroyed everything in their messiah.
Sunami occurred in the back of a earthquake with a intensity of 75.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian voice reduction organization (BNPB), said at a press conference in Jakarta: “Today, when a sonamic threat occurred, people did not lose their work on the beach and were immediately killed.”
"The sunami that came took cars, hills and houses and destroyed everything on the ground, also added that sunami moves before reaching the coastline in the sea at a speed of 80 miles per hour (497 miles per hour).
He said that some of the people went out of the Sunami tree and survived.
Around 167,000 people were displaced from their homes and sent to 24 centers in Palo Scan.
Aerial photographs published by the National Refugee Organization show that many buildings and stores have been destroyed, bridges are complex and broken down, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the storms continued in the coastal city.
This series of earthquakes felt in a region with a population of 244 million.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the earthquake energy released on Friday had power about 200 times the Hiroshima atomic bomb during World War II.
It has been said that the city’s geography, which is located at the end of a long and pure bay, may have grown the size of the sonamic.
Nogoreho described the injury in “Geststed” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotel were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were caught under the roof of demolished buildings, and added to 50 injured and 29 missed.
Nogrohovo said that damages and injuries along the coastline of 300 kilometers north of Palo, a region called Dengola, near the earthquake center, may be more.
Nogrohou said that the communication “completely disrupted and no information” is in the hands of Dengola.
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 30,000 people live there and employees and volunteers have been sent to the regions.
“This is a disaster, but it could have been much worse than that.”
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday because the notification wasn't getting closer to Palo, but the officials said the waves have arrived at the beach when the warning was issued.
The amateur films shared on social media hear a man's voice on the upper floor of a building that with a loud alarming voice brings a soundtrack closer to people on the streets of the building.
Within a few minutes, he took the walls from the water to the beach and took the buildings and cars with him.
Reuters was unable to confirm the correctness of the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami led to electricity and communications around Palo and faced the work of the authorities to coordinate rescue operations with problems.
Officers said the army had taken some time to send help from Jakarta and other cities, but homeless people still need severe food and other basic constraints.
The city’s airport was only open to help help and closed for other cases until October.
President Joko Vidodo visited Skankan Centers in Palo on Sunday.
The number of sunamic victims in Indonesia has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
Mr. Doseba said the World Vision employees from Donggula announced the safety of the city of Palo, in the city, they installed tent refugees in their office area and were placed on the runway scenes.
He said, “They have declared that many houses have been destroyed.”
The situation is very bad.
While immigrant groups have started their movements to reduce disasters with the help of tools available, some have complained that it is prevented from sending foreign immigrant forces with high expertise to Palo.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, financial supplies, resources, and human forces abroad are the only possibility to declare a national disaster in the affected area.
But this statement has not yet happened.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross, Aliya Arriani, said: “This event is still a disaster at the mainland level.”
“Whenever the government accepts it, it can be declared a national disaster. In this case, the path will open for international aid, but such a situation does not exist yet.”
Despite the past two nights of earthquake and sunami on Friday in Palo, friends and family missing continue to hope that a miracle will occur about their loved ones and the story will change the natural sadness of the increase.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of the cage.
On Sunday, the Medaders forces saved a woman who had been caught under a trap for two days alongside her mother's body.

Candy West: Rep's singer who changed his name to Ye
The singer changed his name to Ye.
He announced this change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote, “My official name is the same.”
Sixty-four-year-old, he was named after Ye and used the name of Ye for his eighth album, which was released in June.
This change of name was announced before his presence in the live program on Saturday night, and there he will soon announce his new album called Yandhi.
The producer said he replaced Ariana Granad’s former singer who had cancelled it with “emotional evidence”.
Ye was the current professional name of West, and he said that the word has religious importance for him.
In the beginning of the year, West said in an interview with the grandmother radio program about his album: “I suppose yes a word that is mostly used in the Bible that means you.
“I’m going to be you, I’m going to be for us and for us.
You change your name, which means only to Ye, reflecting our good, bad, and all things.
This album is more than a reflection that we are.”
He's one of the few renowned Rep singers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but has announced that he wants to call his own Love and Brother Love over the next year.
The former West partner, JAY-Z, is also known for or without dark line, large or small letters.
AMLO (President of Mexico) has promised not to use the army against non-systems.
Anders Manuel Lups Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised that he will never use a military force against non-systems at the same time as the 50th anniversary of the bloody public murder.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Palace, "Everybody does not use the army to defeat the Mexican people."
During the peaceful demonstrations held on October 2, 1968, when the left-wing student movements across Latin America grew, 300,000 soldiers were killed on fire.
Lopez O'brador is committed to supporting the youth of Mexico by providing monthly aid to students and the opening of state universities.
He said that unemployment and loss of educational opportunities are causing young people to be attracted to devastating groups.
The U.S. has to double the financial resources of artificial intelligence (AI).
Kay Fu Lee, an AI investor and activist working on Google, Microsoft and Apple, says that since China has been more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double investments for research in this field.
These comments were later announced that the various U.S. government departments published statements on the AI, and that the U.S. generally lacks an official strategy on the AI.
While China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be first-class AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget will be a good start, given that other countries are farther away from the United States and we are looking for next progress in the AI,” he said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that double-investing could double the chances of a successful AI in the future of the United States.
Li is the author of the book “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s top AI companies named Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that was able to defeat Othello in the United States. Then he became CEO of Microsoft and CEO of Google Division in China.
Lee, who appreciates the technological competitions held in the former U.S. government, such as the robotic challenge carried out by the advanced research projects of the Ministry of Defense and wishes for similar cases in the future to help recognize the next dreams.
Lea says researchers in the United States are often working hard to get government aid.
Lee said, “This is not China that researchers have done so for themselves, but these are companies that do so.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technical companies have hired academic teams to work on AI.
Lea said changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of AI.
He says that people who have a doctorate in the field of AI should automatically be given green cards to them.
The Chinese Government Council published its next generation artificial intelligence development programme in July 2017.
According to the National Institute of Natural Science of China, the National Institute of Natural Science provides financial assistance to individuals in academic institutions, which is similar to what the National Institute of Science and other governmental organizations do for U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center that aims to create cooperation between industry and university and the White House also announced the selection committee.
This month, DARPA announced its investment of $2 billion in a plan called AI Next.
And about the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million in AI research.
But it is noted that the U.S. rules seeking to establish a national security commission in the field of artificial intelligence have not worked much over the past few months.
The people of Macedonia say that they want to change the name of their country or not.
The people of Macedonia participated in a whole question on Sunday and voted on the change of their country's name to the "Northern Macedonian Federation", a movement that leads to a resolution of decades of disputes with Greece because this issue is obstacle to the membership of the country in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a type of claim to the country's president and has voted for the entry of Macedonia to NATO and the European Union.
The two governments agreed on a new name in June, but opponents believe that this change will weaken the national identity of the majority of Slovakia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in any question and punish all question of doubt whether the number of voters would reach at least 50 percent required to be valid for all question.
The question on the votes is, “Do you agree with the agreement with Greece and membership in NATO and the European Union?”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zerman Faus, believe that this expense is due to be paid by Macedonia, which is one of the countries originating in the Yugoslavia breach to be able to enter the body of the European Union and NATO.
The 79-year-old Eurea Georgiosca, who lives in Scoop, said: “I have come here today to vote for the future of my chorus, for Macedonian youths to be able to live freely under the European Union, because life will be safer for all of us.”
The parliamentarians have declared sufficient numbers that the result of elections is underway, although it is not legally necessary.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority.
The State Election Commission has announced that no reports of violations of the law have been issued until 1 p.m.
Nevertheless, the number of participants in all surveys did not exceed 16 percent, while around 66% of voters participated in the last parliamentary elections in 2016.
62-year-old Josie Tanoski, one of the voters in the capital of Scopy, said: “I voted for my children, the place is Europe.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaif, his wife Zorika and his son Dachuko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, to open the way to join the country in NATO and the European Union.
In contrast to the parliament in Scotland, Vladimir Kvardarkov prepared a 45-year-old small squad and puts the chairs in front of tents that are punished by all the punished persons.
"We belong to NATO and the European Union, but we want to join them with the army, not through the back door."
“We are poor, but we have your home.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can return to other people like China and Russia and be part of the integrated European and Asia community.”
Fake Prime Minister says NATO membership has a lot of investments in NATO for a country with its unemployment rate over 20%.
"I believe the majority of the people are fans of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the European Union and NATO," he said.
He said, “Yes, it will be a time for our future.”
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia shows that between 30 and 33% of the population will participate in all the situations of the questionnaire – this amount is less than the number.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telema TV network shows that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote.
To be successful, the 50 per cent rate is required, in addition to a vote.
The failure in all questions is the first serious strike on the policy of Western government fans that came into power last month.
Watch: Sergio Aguiro plays Manchester City, flowers among all the defenders past you and the ball.
Sergio Aguiro and Reim Sterling on Monday at the Manchester United Sports Station, gave me a defence for you to be Manchester City with the result of 2 wins at zero.
Aguiro joined the team's door in 65 minutes like eating the ball.
The Argentinian attacker restarted at the beginning, received Passy in the middle line.
He passed between three defenders to you quickly and opened space for himself.
Then he saw his Aguiro among the four green players in the circle.
With his movements, he lay his defense around the edge of the punishment.
Then he went to his left and reached Sterling.
The Forward of England once again hit the ball in the middle of the box, and he hit the ball with his right foot, and Matthew Rayan hit the bar gate for you, and the ball hit the wall to the right gate.
Papa Guardiola, director of Tim City told reporters: “Aguiro is dealing with certain problems in his legs.”
“We talked about him to play for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to produce a flower at the same time.”
But it was the Australians who first flowered in this highest league for the sky blues.
The flower was played in 29 minutes.
Aguiro received the ball in the depths of the earth for you.
She brought the ball to the beauty of the left side to Laurie's breast.

Scherzer wants to play as Spioller against the Rockies team
Although the Nationals team has been removed from the polyoff competitions, they have no reason to try to start another.
But Scherzer's team always hopes to win the game on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it has the concept of polyoff for Rockies, which has had a more game than Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Region National League.
Rocky won at least one card on Friday night with 5 to 2 win against Nationals, but they still intend to have their first title.
“As we play for nothing, at least we can touch the ball, knowing how much the atmosphere is here with this crowd, and the other team will probably play at the highest level we have ever met.
Why don’t I participate in that race?”
The Nationals team has to announce a starter for the game on Sunday, but it has been reported that they want to post Scherzer.
Scherzer, who may have a 30-month start, has a drilling exercise session on Thursday and regular rest on Sunday.
Washington’s right-hand player statistics are: 18-7 with 253 ERA and 300 hits in 202,223 games in this season.
Trump's speeches in West Virginia
President Trump talked televisably about the situation in the current state of Great Dean and Bret-Kawano and also about the importance of the Republican participation in interim elections.
“We will play all our achievements in November.
Five weeks are one of the most important elections in our lives.
“This is one of the biggest and big elections – I’m not a candidate in these elections, but I’m actually because I’m fighting for the candidates here.”
Trump continued: “You see this terrible group, this terrible radical of Democrats, and you see that these things are happening now.
They are designed to use any means of obtaining the power you need, you see these posts and the abusiveness of this group.
They don’t care who are injured in this work, who are left behind to reach power and control, this is what they want: power and control, but we don’t want to give them these two.”
He said, “The mission of the Democrats is to be the “good resistance and the obstacle to traction.”
He said, "And you see how angry the Democrats have spoken in the last four days, and they have spoken wrongly and wrongly."
He pointed out to the U.S. Senate Judgment Committee and Senator of Democrats Dian Finchstein how they had defeated him.
“Do you give him the answer?
Do you read the documents that you read?
Wow, wow, what?
“No, no, I’m waiting – the body language that was really bad – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The working party is no longer a wide church.
Of those who are advocates of freedom of expression, this is not tolerable.
When Mumentum activists in the local party voted critically, I wasn’t surprised.
Nevertheless, I was the last in the line of representatives of the working party who did not welcome it - all for freedom of expression.
Joan Ryan, my parliamentary partner, had seen similar behavior, because he was strongly opposed to Jewishity.
In my case, criticism of me was because of the opposition to Crimea Kurbin.
There are similar issues about the importance of politics in terms of economics, of national security in terms of Europe, in which crime was differing with former leaders.
On Friday, the Worker Party’s meeting in East Natingham announced that “we want to be a comprehensive and generous meeting.”
In the eight years I was the local representative of the working party, that was exactly what the GC meetings were on Friday night.
Unfortunately, today, this session is not seen in many sessions and the promise of politics "more compassionate and more mild" if it had begun for a long time.
It is very evident that the different views of the working party are not tolerated and the opinions are being judged whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This phenomenon began shortly after Jimmy’s leadership began, when I had previously imagined sharing a similar political theory with his colleagues, they thought I wanted to remove them and they were positive about national security or the single EU market that I never agreed to.
Every time I speak in general - and really doesn't matter what I'm saying - it's a very serious speech about the abuse of social media that is demanding non-option, condemning the policy of the center, they tell me that I should not be in the working party.
And that wasn’t just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the views they are about me are political.
I am exposed to professional and determined by co-workers who face sexual abuse or racial cells every day but are not ashamed at all.
One of the desperate aspects of this period of politics is that abuse has become natural to a certain level.
Jeremy Kerib said last week the Labour Party had to educate culture to bear other words in itself.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad church, and with any movement resulting from “confidence in self” or changing the rule of choice, the party is restricted.
In the last two years, I have had a lot of recommendations that make me fall down, have nothing to say and just say very well.
But it’s not something I’ve been in politics to do so.
I joined the Worker Party 32 years ago as a school student, which was motivated by the government of Tacher. This led me to officially lose high school classes, I was trying to provide better public service for those who need it – it did not matter to be a member of the board or a minister of government.
I have never hid my politics, including in the last elections.
No one in the East of Natingham will be struggling with the political situations and the areas that I am currently in leadership.
To those who encouraged this movement on Friday, I can only say that when the country moves towards the choice that hurts our households, businesses and public services, I don’t want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the working party leader.
But really one of my messages that haven't been reached to Natingham Mumentum, and to members of the Board, members of the working party or other is: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to no choice or political interest will return to me from what is alleged to benefit all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Council of East Natingham.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr unfairly went to president
Trying in the two final stages may change somewhat to the final result, but there is no doubt that the merit of this extraordinary and interesting victory was in the League of Ragby Tent.
They are currently at the chairman of the table and the only team that hasn't been on one side yet.
Finally, it was their top defense, and with the chances that led them to take the host team and coach Peter Morchey had the right to be satisfied.
He said, “We’ve been testing during the competitions and haven’t failed yet, so we have to be happy too.”
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Good to Ire, they used their chances better than we.”
The attempt by Grant Anderson was completed in the 14th minute by Frisier Climeo and introduced the Ier, but a yellow card was given to Captain Scotland, Rory Hughes, for the game by Warriors, and Jason Baghgot did not take an effort without passing.
Climeo hit the front player Ier with a panel hit, before that, just in half the game, the ball produced fruit, and then, with the single passport, made Ier profit of the score 17 to 5.
But Mallory started the second half well and Patrick Anderson tried to reduce the difference by passport to five points.
After that Ruaridh Knott's severe injury, the game stopped for a long time, after restart, through the attempt by McDonald's Staffor, by passport, Iro again increased the distance.
After that, Blair McFerson, Captain Iar Yellow Card, lost another player at the end of a severe pressure.
Nevertheless, the host team returned to the game, and when Sterns Hachinson picked up a pavilion on Klemo without a yellow card, McFerson became behind the attacker group of Irish Daun.
Climeo made a quick passport, just like what was done in the beginning, then picked up Kyle into David Armstrong's seat, and removed the artist's attacker Gregor from the fifth host area.
Still Game is looking for a new professional in the restaurant industry.
It appears after Ford Cairo's actress Still Game is discovered as the director of a licensed restaurant, moving towards the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old man played the role of Jack Jarois in the BBC's favorite series, which he was also writing for a long time with Greg Hamfield, as a comic couple.
The two have announced that the next series is the ninth series will be the last set of the show, and it appears that Kiringan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record lists, he will be limited to the director of Adriftmore with complexity.
The actor has not explained this, although Scottish Sun said that Keran is looking to enter the "perroque restaurants" trade in Glasgow.
"Sea is for us": Bolivia, who does not travel to any sea, hopes the court to open a way for the country towards the Pacific
Marines are protecting from the seaside in Lapaz.
In the public buildings, the blue ocean flag has emerged.
At the bases of the sea, from the lake of Titicaka to the Amazon, the logo was seen: “The sea is our right.
It is a duty to regain it.”
In the whole of Bolivia, which does not travel to any sea, the memory of losing the coastline and delivering it to Chile, which led to a bloody war in the nineteenth century, is still alive – just like the enthusiasm for the Caireans in the Pacific.
These hopes have reached their highest level after decades, because Bolivia, after five years of surrender in court, is waiting for the court of the International Court on the first October.
Roberto Calzadia diplomats of Bolivia said: “Bolivia is moving, the spirit of unity and calm is ruling and, of course, is waiting for positive results.”
Many Bolivian people across the country are watching the ICJ order on large display pages, hoping the Laha Court - after negotiating decades - to vote for Bolivian claims and employ Chile in particular for Bolivian dominance and access to the sea of negotiations.
O'Morals, the President of Carism and Bolivia, who has a difficult struggle to re-election in the next year, is particularly proud to announce Monday's agenda.
At the end of August, he promised, “We will soon return to the Pacific.”
But some expensive analysts believe that the court seems far away to make a decision for Bolivian – and if it does, it will be accompanied by a little change.
The United Nations Court, which is based in the Netherlands, has no option to grant a part of the country of Chile and has stated that the court cannot determine the outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zarate, International Law Specialist in Chile, said that the ICJ Court was announced only six months after the hearing of the arguments that indicated the case was "not complicated."
And far from Bolivian extra disputes, it may have been restored over the past four years.
Zárate said, “The issue of access to the sea has been misused by the current Bolivian government.”
He believes that the adventurous words of Morals were caused by the Hasan Nit of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss on some points, but after that, the discussion will be very difficult.
Two countries have no ambassadors in the country since 1962.
Former President Edward Rodriguez Wolts, Bollywood representative in Laha, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had an unusual speed.
He said Bolivia would have on Monday “a great opportunity to start a new period of relations with Chile” and will have an opportunity to end the 139-year-old differences in particular mutual interests.
Calzilla also said that Morales - which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin American countries - uses the maritime issue as a political warrior to its own benefit.
He added, “Bolivy will never pass its right to access to the Pacific.”
“This is an opportunity to see how we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there is no nuclear weapon, unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Rei Yung Ho said that until the country could trust Washington, it would never destroy its nuclear weapons.
Re said this on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He asked the U.S. to take the promises that have been made during the two-state meetings in Singapore.
The statement pointed out to Mike Pompeo, Foreign Minister, who appears to have arrived soon to restart negotiations that had been conducted in Singapore more than three months ago with North Korean leader Kim Jong Yun on nuclear diplomacy.
The continuation of the U.S. sanctions and opposition to declare the end of the Korean war will cause North Korea to kneel to the knees.
Washington acts very carefully for the agreement until Pyongyang hasn't moved seriously in the way of the weapon.
Kim and U.S. President Trump took a second appointment.
But there are serious doubts about the removal of nuclear plants, which is probably the only way to ensure the security of the country.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang in the next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows the Last Line of Very Large Hairs on the Stretch Road Near You
If you want to grow your cluster or completely avoid sunlight, you don’t need to be too large.
Valentino and Tom Brown, fashion designers, offered a series of very large hats for the SS19 series that welcomed the design style during the Paris Fashion Week.
Unpleasant wings filled Instagram in the summer season, and designers exposed their creative eyesights in the shoe dress.
The design, drawn by Valentino, was a beagle on the head that was decorated with a wide edge that covers the head of the model ladies.
Other accessories that were very large included Indian decorated, witch clay, and even an ananas, but were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a set of strange masks that used only during Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks were wearing lipstick and more reminding Hannibal Letters to design clothes.
One of the designs was like a sweater that was accompanied by the breathing tube and swimming glasses, and the other design was like a coffee ice.
And if you can put on these strange and strange puzzles and look at all of you, this is a chance with you.
Stylish observers predict that these large bowls can open their way to the stretch stores near you.
Outside of the size of the La Bomba, a 60-inch-wide shore-breaking crop that can be seen on the head of people like Rihanna to Emily Ragakovsky.
The intellectual label, which was in the back of very unnecessary shells spread across social media, posted a large creativity of the spot-out - a coastal sack that is almost the size of the Mayo swimming model that carries it.
The orange-burning shark with the sharks of the sharks that have a white portion of meat was the main design of the Jacquemus 'La Riviera SS19 series in the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a fashion specialist of famous people, told FEMAIL: "These large sharks and coastal pockets are expected to be offered next summer - as the designer has had such a huge impact, so the demand for large accessories cannot be ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens in the world
Independent schools of Scotland have a high level of education and continued in 2018 with excellent results in the experiments, which is only reinforced with individual and crowded successes in sports, art, music and other social affairs.
These schools with more than 300,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scotland Independent School Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best services to students and their parents.
Independent schools are seeking to prepare students for graduates and higher education, selective jobs and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational section that can design and execute a custom educational program, we see that modern languages continue to exist as a favorite and interested topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, your speech will enter his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, your speech will enter his heart.”
This is an important point that we can’t only speak English in order to build relationships and trust with people of other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that foreign language lessons are at the League's chairman with the highest degree of acceptance in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying in foreign languages gained a superior A degree.
The data collected from 74 SCIS-member schools shows that 72% of students studying in the Mandandanian Chinese discipline gained Higher A degree, as well as 72% of those studying in German, 99% of those studying in French and 66% of those studying in French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland know foreign languages as a vital skill for children and teenagers who will certainly need it in the future.
Currently, foreign languages are taken as a lesson, as compared to STEM lessons (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere seriously taught.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skill Commission in 2014 showed that among employers' needs to recruit, 17 per cent is related to a shortage of language skills in the set.
Therefore, the importance of language skills to prepare young people for future careers is increasing.
Depending on the future job opportunities that need language, you can see how much these skills are needed in the world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if the second language is learned, in the future a real advantage will have that life can use.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners automatically places multiple languages ahead of the competitor.
According to a YouGov survey conducted in England and in 2013, 75% of people have no ability to speak in a foreign language, and France is the only language that is the percentage of the two, that is, 15% of people can speak in this language.
This is why investment in language education is important for children today.
Knowing different languages, especially the language of developing countries, increases the chances of children to find the right job.
In Scotland, schools teach different languages.
Several schools are focused on modern classical languages, while teaching some other languages that will be more important for England by 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
No matter which language you are interested in, there are several languages to choose from in schools, and educational workers who are specialized in this country are also available.
Independent schools in Scotland move to provide a learning environment to prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
Today, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied the vital importance of foreign languages in the future of the country, so it must be involved in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
In independent schools, the right to choose, diversity and superiority is still offered to Scotland’s children.
It must be done (in French)

Mike Trudeau, a reporter, Leckers, said James would probably play for a limited period of time.
After the exercise at the beginning of this week, James was asked to launch his plans for the first six season games.
He said: “I don’t need pre-season games in this lamb from my career periods, to get ready.
Trump's election time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Trump starts a set of elections in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first round of five planned Trump meetings next week, including stops in Tennessee and Mississippi areas that are politically agreed on by Trump.
Trump, with a vote confirming his elected individual to fill out an empty chair of the Supreme Court, intends to support them for the next mid-term elections as the republic is at risk of losing control of Congress in November elections.
When will Trump’s election meeting be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump’s election meeting at Wheeling West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight at ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election rounds in West Virginia online in the following section via live YouTube broadcast.
Trump will probably point out at the meeting of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, that he was stressed by allegations on sexual intercourse and that he was suspended by the Senate voting for a week to conduct FBI investigations.
But the main goal of this group of electoral gatherings is to help the republic and strengthen them in the November elections.
According to Reuters’ report, the spokesman of the campaign, President Trump, said that these five election meetings will be held next week with the aim of “energying volunteers and supporters because the republic wants to protect and develop the majority in the Senate and Parliament.
One of Trump’s spokespersons, who did not want to be disclosed, said to Reuters, “Control Congress is as important as it is in the President’s work plan that he will travel to as many states as possible because we will enter the season of the campaign’s occupation.
According to a West Virginia Metro News report, the election meeting scheduled tonight for Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling could gather supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media.”
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the past month that Trump visits West Virginia, the same state that won over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump seeks to help the candidate of the Western republic or Virginia for Senna, Mr. Patrick Morris, who is behind the investigations.
According to Reuters’ report, the political expert at West Virginia University said: “This is not a good sign for the Mauritius that the president is forced to come here to help him find his position in investigations.”
Ryder 2018: The U.S. team shows its commitment to fighting and maintaining hopes for joining single competitions on Sunday
After three episodes of one side, four-person golf games Saturday evening, it can be the same as the Ryder Cup needs.
Nosan Aong Movement is a totally eternal sporting concept, but players really believe it and in similar directions, there has never been anything more than that.
So they say where is the move now?
Jordan Spieth said, “They had six top points and now have reached four points, so I think we do it with a little motion.
Of course, Europe has a superior, four points in front and twelve other games in front.
Nevertheless, as Spieth says, Americans feel that they have little moves and have a lot of things that can be interesting to them, particularly on the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played with each other all day, each taking three points from four points.
Spieth movements took from T to Green, were very great and the likeness is considered for the rest.
Continuing to play, the shouting of joy became higher, he was able to put a life-threatening foot into the hole and match the race in four points, equaling when he and Thomas were two after two points.
Pat, who made the race win for them at the age of 15, accompanied a similar cried, some kind of cried that told you he believed he would not be removed by an American team.
Spieth said, “You really have to try hard and be worried about your own race.”
That’s all that’s left for each of these players.
18 holes to do great things.
The only players who have been able to win more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood the legends of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but admirable European couple have won four points out of four possible points and offered an endless job.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who had been bowing not only on Saturday evening, but also on Saturday morning, Friday evening, and even on Friday morning at nine fields second.
The way their energy is exchanged with this happy and full of energy, clearly shows that they are players who can win on Sunday, and when the sun rises at Le Golf National, there will be no other famous player except Fleetwood and Molinari to guarantee Europe's potential victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still very early to talk about the greatness of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly finished the work of Sergio Garcia, who were next to Alex Noren hero in the fourth-morning quarterbacks.
One boogie and two doubles in nine first fields, cast Spaniard and Swede into a hole that they could never get out of it.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Watching four-person competitions and four-person balls closely due to interactions between the pairs of players, they give and don't give advice, and the way a strategy can change at a time is very attractive.
To date, Europe has improved its performance as a team and is significantly entering the end of the day, but this season of four-person games showed that the U.S. team also had a fighting team, which some people had doubted about, especially Americans.
Europe is at the end of the Ryder Cup at the top 10-6.
After Europe appeared very well in the four-person and four-touch competitions on Saturday, 10-6 of the U.S. were able to get a good prize on the end of the day.
The super couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were able to win two victories against Tiger Woods that made a lot of effort to inspire others and achieve their scores at Le Golf National until now.
Thomas Bjorn of the European team who wanted to retain Jamie lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was able to overcome one of the American players who had a bad shot and scored 3-1 in the four-morning matches.
The U.S. team showed more resistance in the four-month competitions and won two matches, but they couldn't repay their survival.
Jim Furyk team requires eight of the 12 single competitions on Sundays to maintain the championship.
Fleetwood is the first new European job to score four points back, while Molinari and he doubled Molliwood after a weekend, and Ryder's second couple in history are the first four points for their first race.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-touch competitions, they defeated Bryson Dechambeau, the new American who had devastated their spirit, with a shorter result of 4&5.
Woods, who was hard to win in two matches on Saturday, showed his skill and talent, but in 19 to 29 of his matches, he defeated four-person, four-person and seven-person matches.
Justin Rose retreated in the morning four-touch competitions and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson for four-touch competitions, and they were able to win 1&2 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are in the first and third classes of the world.
Nevertheless, Europeans did not take their way on a fun day, along with printed landmarks in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, three-time winner, scored two points on Saturday, made a good model for Americans.
They won a tough 1&2 match in four games against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to the field, losing the first two holes, and won 3&4 results on Poulter and Rory McIlroy.
In Ryder's history, only two times it happened that the team could compensate for four retreat points and enter individual competitions, although the Furyk team needs only equally to maintain the championship.
Nevertheless, after the second in two days, it seems to have been too difficult for them to face Sunday's anti-attack.
North Korea says there is no way to dismiss a single side without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions causes more confidence in the United States, and under such conditions will not be present to deliver its own nuclear weapons to one side.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Institute’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken its own “significant steps to demonstrate goodness,” including the stop of nuclear and missile tests, the elimination of the nuclear test site and the commitment to the lack of nuclear weapons and technology.
He said, “But we did not receive any relative response from the United States.”
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not act as first or as part of our weaponry.
While Ri repeats North Korea's repeated disagreements on Washington's resistance to a "step" approach to nuclear weapon that North Korea will receive the prize based on the implementation of each step, it does not repeat in this statement completely, but his statement is in this manner, a remarkable way of convergence or convergence.
Ri noted a joint statement held by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first official meeting held between the current U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, in which Kim is committed to attempting to “destroy your Korean Peninsula”.
North Korea is sending an official end to the 53-1950 Korean war, but the United States said Pyongyang should first look at its own nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted demands to reduce severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the approach to the first nuclear weapon," said Ri, "and intends to reach its own goal by increasing the pressure of sanctions and even oppose the "end of war" signal.
Some fools think that punishments can bring us to the knees, this is a dirty idea.
But the issue here is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our uncertainty.”
Ri did not mention the second meeting plan between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President had said a few days ago in the United Nations this week.
Instead of three meetings held between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the past five months, he said: “If the opposite side of the issue was the U.S., rather than South Korea, the North Korean nuclear weapon would not be captured by Ben Ben.”
Nevertheless, Mr. Ri's speech was completely different from last year, he said to the UN General Assembly a year ago after Trump called Kim the "missile man" who is suicide, targeting the U.S. land with North Korean missiles.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea "fully" this year, praised him for the courage of Kim to move towards the weapon, but said he still had to do much, and sanctions must remain until the North Korean nuclear weapon is broken.
Trump said on Wednesday he had no time frame for it and said, “If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have stated that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
Nevertheless, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The sanctions of the Security Council must continue with intensity and with no shortages until we make sure that the nuclear weapon is fully, final and confirmed.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has increased North Korea's sanctions in an effort to eliminate the means of financing nuclear programs and Pyongyang Baltic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri in the meeting of the National Assembly and then said he would go back to Pyongyang in the next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting of the two heads of the country.
Pompeo traveled three times to North Korea this year, but his final trip did not take place well.
He left Pyongyang in July as he said progress had been made but North Korea just accused him of "goingster desires" after a few hours.
North Korea has pledged in meeting Moon in the current month to eliminate a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States takes “proportional measures”.
He said Kim was meant to be the "proportional" security guarantees that Trump committed in Singapore and said he intends to move towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Students spend a lot of lessons about rest.
This year, a new lesson at Harvard University, in an effort to fight the expansion of Macau culture in the field of study among the “natural nights” that consume a lot of caffeine, wants to sleep more than all graduate students.
One of the university scholars found that most of the world's best universities students are unconscious about the basic principles related to how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and an active specialist at Brigham and Women Hospital, has designed this lesson and believes that this lesson is first in the United States.
After a lecture on the low-sleeved impact of learning, he decided to launch this lesson unit.
She said to the Telegraph, “At the end of a girl came to me and said, ‘Why did this happen to me now and in the last year?’
He said, "No one has told me anything about the importance of sleep - which made me surprised."
This class unit is for the first time in the curriculum this year and explains to students how good sleep habits help to improve educational performance and sports as well as improve public health.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the university decided to add this lesson to the curriculum after finding students seriously suffering from sleep throughout the week.
This one-hour lesson includes a set of interactive activities.
In a section, there is a picture of a bedroom that students click on cups of coffee, beads, sports shoes and books, and information about the impact of caffeine, light, and how sports performance is low-influenced, as well as the importance of getting used to sleep at their disposal.
Otherwise, participants are told how short sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the university's campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
Professor Czeisler added: “We know that this lesson will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health.”
He said there is still a culture of pride in “living night” and the increase in modern technology and pressure on students shows that sleeplessness is increasing a problem.
He said to be sure to have enough sleep and quality, the student should be a “serial weapon” to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety – even avoiding excess weight, because low sleep leads to a state of hunger that causes a person to feel hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied in Chemical and Physical Biology and attended Harvard in the first year, assisted Professor Czeisler in designing the lesson.
He said that this lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to try to offer it throughout the university.
He expressed hope that the next step is to apply for a postgraduate degree to all students before joining the Competitive Institution, a similar educational program.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should be warned to specify their sleep time and also wake up time and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” incurred by the electronic devices and LED lighting systems that could remove your daily balance and lead to sleeping difficulties.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Flowers Fail Gerrard Helpers
The Dolly Menga hits Steven Gerrard together and led the Blue Rangers team to be defeated in a race outside of another home in Livingston, resulting in 0-1 to be defeated.
The Ibrox team was looking for its first recording after the 1-4 victory at St Johnstone but Gary Holt was the second defeat of Gerrard in the 18 game that worked as a coach to keep the team with eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership team.
Menga seven minutes before the end of the first half of the flower, and Rangers’ helpers with their slight motivation, have never been able to offer a good show as necessary to play the game equally.
While Rangers now falls in sixth rank, Livingston has reached third rank and is only due to the flowers behind the Hibernian.
One of the Rangers players, Calum Spence, was injured by the shade that apparently was thrown out of the corner of the gym’s ends, and should be treated continuously for the treatment of his head wounds, which could cause them difficulties.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that led Ayr to the past to the final half of Betfred.
On the other hand, Holt went to the field with the same 11 previous Livingston players who could take a score from Hearts last week and must be happy that the team is ready to win their competitor every time.
Rangers may have more ball ownership, but Livingston used better the balls he had.
They had to come to the flower only two minutes after arriving when Menga sent the ball to Scott Pittman with his first deep pass at Allan McGregor's door, but this hafbok lost the great opportunity and sent the ball out with much distance.
A remote free hit was shot by Keaghan Jacobs and came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his team defender Alan Lithgow was able to send only far behind the door.
Rangers gained control of the game but about their game in a third end, it seemed to be more than belief, there is hope.
Alfredo Morelos was sure to believe that he should be pronounced a petition in fifteen minutes after he met Steven Lawless, but Dr. Steven Thomson did not pay attention to the requests of a Colombian player and noted it to be removed.
Rangers hit only two shots in the first half in the frame, but the former Ibrox gang, Liam Kelly, hit the Lassana Coulibaly head and the calm Ovie Ejaria hit slightly.
Although the 34-minute Livingston team may have been contrary to the game flow, no one can deny that they deserved it.
Rangers couldn't get back to Jacobs's programs again.
Scott Arfield, when Declan Gallagher passed the ball, did not react to Scott Robinson, and he brought the ball to Menga with his homeowner, and he also easily hit the final hit and opened the door.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly and Ryan Kent between the two halfs, and this change when the attacker intended to bring the ball to Morelos showed almost immediate impact, but Kelly came out with a beautiful move from the door and prevented it from reaching.
But Livingston continued to offer exactly the same beauty game that the viewers liked and played Lithgow and Halkett one after the other high balls.
The Holt team could increase its superiority at the end of the moment, but McGregor stood well against Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball that was sent from Corner.
Rangers’ replacement player, Glenn Middleton, claimed at the end of the moment when he met Jacobs, had to be declared a penalty but Thomson did not pay attention to him again.

And now a page of our journal Sunday morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago on such a day and number ... a day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gaigar created a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately led to the construction of a device known as Gaigar counter.
With the 1950 film “The Songs of Coronado”, with the artists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, scientists who seemed unfaithful, the Gaigar counter, who was so far one of the main foundations of science, became one of the main foundations of public culture:
He said, “What else is it?”
Rogers: “Gaigger is used to track radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put this phone on meat, you can really hear the effects of atoms that can be absorbed by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “It’s really going to leave now!”
Hans Gaigar died in 1945 just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention named after him is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to see the “beam cells”
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to see and kill the “beam cells”
The vaccine trains the immune system to identify the cells of the patient as part of the treatment.
This method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” proteins that are common in many cancers and then injected again.
The vaccine test showed a hopeful outcome in patients with various cancers.
A woman who trains her immune system to identify the “bell cells” was treated and found her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes immune cells extracting from the patient, changing them in the laboratory in a way that may be the common protein that exists in many of the cancers and called HER2, and then re-injection of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Cancer Foundation at Bethesda Maryland said: “Our results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explained that the HER2 is “developed by several types of cancer” including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and large intestines.
A similar approach to eliminating immune cells from the patient’s body and their “teaching” to target cancer cells has been successfully done in the treatment of a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West paid for Trump's support after wearing a MAGA hat after attending SNL.
Well, it didn't happen.
Kanye West, after enchanting President Donald Trump in the Saturday Night Live program and said it would be elected in 2020, was in the studio Ho.
After performing the third song that night called Ghost Town, which was covered by a hook with the logo Make America Great, he expressed uncertain words against Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
He said, “It has happened many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How do you love Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have gone to America a long time ago.”
SNL started the program with the artist Matt Damon, where Hollywood stars paid a traduction of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judgment Committee on the allegation of sexual abuse imposed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this section wasn't broadcast, West's speech film was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social networks.
It is not clear whether Rock was going to make West laugh or not.
West also spoke to the flock who had difficulty in the back of the scene because of the cloth he covered.
According to the Washington Examiner, he said: “They were excited to me behind the scene.
They said, “Don’t go there with that cake.”
They gave me a lot of greed!
And they said unto me, Thou art in the midst of the wicked.
West continued, “Do you want to see the devastating space?” and then he said, “You should wear me a Superman Channel, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want to move the world forward?
Try love.”
Veriety reported her speeches caused him to be at least twice by the audience, and it seemed to have SNL broadcasters beaten, and one said to them, “The entire studio has been overwhelmed with a deadly silence.”
The West was programmed in the last moment as an alternative to American singer Ariana Grande, who was his former boyfriend, Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
West was surprised by the performance of the song I Love it and while his clothes were like a Perrier bottle, many people were surprised.
West, Chairman of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, tweeted: “To one of the braveest people: Thank you for your resistance to MOB.”
But the host of the conversation plan, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West “is showing what he really believes, and that’s definitely amazing.”
“But I prefer not to support anyone who thinks to accept and play in the way of thinking that I think is harmful to my society (by buying music or clothing or supporting the “Henry”).
He added: He is free.
We too.”
Before the program, the singer Rep announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said that he is now “a person who has already been known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and leaves the foot of Diddy known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow Snoop Dogg, a rap singer, was formerly named Snoop Lion and, of course, the musician Dan lost the legendary Prince, changed his name to a sign, and then became an artist who was formerly known as Prince.
He was accused of murder after a knife in the restaurant.
After a man set a knife target in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday, a 45-year-old man was accused of murder.
Police said the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to be present in the court on Monday.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington star serial game Tagh and bed criticized due to toxic men's syndrome
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow, a skilled female sword in the challenging, fantasy and medieval HBO networking game.
But this 31-year-old actress is criticized by having a hero's hero's hero, and it is said that showing such roles often makes young boys feel that they need to be grievous and tough to respect.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "the problem came up" and asked him how to deal with the problem of toxic men in the MeToo # age.
Kit, who recently married his full-time role in the Table and Throne series, Rose Leslie, who is also a 31-year-old, announced that she “all feels power” about solving this issue.
He said, “Now, I’m personally completely feeling power – where did we make mistakes about maleness?”
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that the TV by its very male characters may be somewhat responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He said, “What is personal and what is taught?
What is taught on television and streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our period - how should we change this?
Because it is clear that a matter for young men has been wrong.”
He also announced in the interview that when the series will finish the game in the next summer, he does not intend to play in advance or continue the series, saying "He's done with the battlefield and the horses."
From November to November, Kit plays the True West re-release of Sam Shepard's story of a filmmaker and his brother who is a thief.
The actress recently revealed that he seemed to have the best consequence of the series of the game for him, to meet his wife Rose.
He said, “I met my wife in this series, so this series gave me my family and future life from here.”
Rose plays the role of Ygritte, the lover of the character Kit, Jon Snow, in this fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the Leslie family’s property lands in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% turnout in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from this disease.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second three months of 2018.
In the nearest majority of new cases, this disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which indicates change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has expanded rapidly in some parts of China due to the injection and transmission of contaminated blood.
Chinese health officials in the Yunnan County Conference said: “But the number of people with HIV has decreased and has reached almost zero.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased 100,000 per year.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem in the LGBT community of China.
In 1997, homosexuality was removed from the illegal state of China, but discrimination against LGBT people is very widespread.
Research estimates that 90%-70 percent of men who have sex with men are finally married to women due to the conservative values of the country.
A lot of the transmission of this disease occurs due to insufficient sexual protection in such a relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters rejected his employee’s disclosure of GOP Senators
The U.S. representative Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected claims that one of his employees sent personal information to three republican senators or the U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the law.
The Democratic Representative of Los Angeles said that these claims were made by experts and websites of the “excessive right party”.
Waters, in a statement on Twitter, said: “Dog, dog, and again repeated lies.”
According to reports, the published information included the home address and phone number of Senators, Mr. Lindsey Graham, from Southern California and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of the state of Utah.
Information sent on the internet on Thursday by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during one of the Senate meetings on the allegations of sexual intercourse against the Supreme Court nominated by Brett Kavanaugh.
This was revealed shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Hill reported that protective work sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that specifies the source of these posts was dependent on the Waters Office and published the information of one of Waters employees.
Waters continued: “This allegation is totally undisputed and absolutely false.”
“My employee – whose identity, personal information and security as a result of these false and false claims – was not responsible for disclosure of this information.
This is a totally unfair and absolutely false allegation.”
Waters’ statement quickly caused online criticism, including by former White House Secretary of Press Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: “This lies was accompanied by anger.”
“This indicates that he does not have the right spirit for membership in Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something that is not done, he should not be angry.
You shouldn't spend a lot of money.
You shouldn't ask the accused's motives.
But it must be calm and honest.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of Democrats from Judge Kavanaugh who was accused by critics who seemed to be very angry at the Thursday meeting.
Omar Navarro, one of the Republican candidates who wanted to take Waters instead of in the midterm elections, also announced his opinion on Twitter.
He said, “If he is right, it is a great claim.”
Waters has warned his office of “the relevant legal institutions” about these false claims.
“We will make sure that the staff are clear and legally responsible for all the harmful and dangerous actions that have taken on one or all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson Anti-Sassue Film
It has recently been decreed that in every new film that has a connection to England, we are watching signs of choice, and it appears to believe this about the new version of the Johnny English action-committee - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Does the production of Tanz movies about how much post we are really will be the opportunity to export new people?
Anyway, Johnny English has a big eye, rubber and unexpected face, able to get licensed and for the second time deliver a new version - which shows his name more than anything that is a funny comic character designed for non-English film areas.
He is, of course, a stupid serial officer who, despite the strange manifestation of the linguistic fat, combined some of the character of Detective Clouseau, the effects of Mr Bean and some of the man's character, and with a film of fire cars in May at the 2012 London Opening Festival.
He is also basically based on the international traveler and Atkinson's secrets, which was broadcast on Barclaycard television ads that are now forgotten, and left the place after the shooting.
In the latest version of the JE film, there is only one or two beautiful scenes.
I liked the scene that Johnny English was getting closer to the middle-aged copper helicopter, and the holes of it were shortly touching his bone.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy on the scene, but it feels that it’s weak and strange too much, particularly because now the “secret” brand movies like 007 and their mission is impossible to offer comedy with confidence as part of the film’s components.
It feels that the tons of this movie are more considered for children to adults and, in my opinion, the Johnny English tons events are less than the tons of Atkinson's work in silent films entitled Bean character, initiative and focus.
This time, the idea of the film is that Britain is at a serious risk.
A cyber-hacker has influenced the super-series of British spy networks and reveals the identity of all British spys from the fear of serving the spy - a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This last hit for a prime minister is an important and under pressure face and has already disappeared because of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson offers his best performance in this role like Teresa-May but nothing more in a film that can take advantage of it.
His information advisers tell him that since all active spyers have been at risk, he must re-employ one of his retirement.
This means that Johnny English is currently working as a teacher at a modern educational institution and is providing secret lessons about how to be a secret factor: there are several beautiful works here and in the scenes where English is teaching at the spy academy.
English quickly returns to Whitehall and is prepared at a brief announcement meeting, then joining his former fellow Bough who had many problems alongside, which is re-evaluated by Ben Miller.
Bough is now famous and transferred to a submarine commander, the role of a high-class woman who played Vicki Pepperdine but couldn't play well.
So Batman and Robin, who were terribly mistaken at Her Majesty's Secret Service, returned to the scene and took the role of a beautiful woman named Ophelia Bulletova alongside Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by a billionaire active in the range of technology that has a carism character, he claims that it can solve Britain's computer problems: the negative role of Jason Volta EVA by Jack Lacy.
English and Bough are starting their tons: as a pre-service they are leading to fire a French restaurant; by hiding their bottles in the luxurious Volta boat and leaving the country, they are making a lot of work to create a lot of homecuts; and English is trying to create a lot of virtual reality to get in touch with every Volta.
Surely all efforts have been made for the last scene, but although it is pleasant and at the same time acting, the effects of children's special films are also seen in all the movies.
Something totally average.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't find the answer to my question: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is really compatible with its talent?
The Labour Party has rejected a plan to work four days a week based on which the British are working for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s worker party is planning an excess plan that will lead the British to work four days a week - but to pay five days.
According to reports, the party wants to give employees a day more leisure with rights using savings created through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution.
This plan will cause employees to take care of the three-day weekend holidays - and continue to receive the same previous salary.
Resources say that this idea is a "prone" economic programme of this party and that it drives the country to move towards the interests of workers.
Movement to the four-day work week has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
One of the leading workers’ sources told Sunday Times: “It is expected to be done a re-examination of policies before the end of the year.
“This work won’t happen a half, but the week’s plan has four working days, is a desire that fits with the party’s approach to establish a balance in the economy for workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party.
The Worker Party is not the first party to approve this idea, but the Green Party in the 2017 election campaign committed itself to implementing the week plan has four working days.
However, this requirement is currently not generally approved by the Working Party.
One of the spokespersons of the Labour Party said: “Every week does not have four working days of political party, and the party does not have a plan for it.”
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell used the Working Party's conference last week to explain his opinion on a social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he decided to take power in public service companies from “unknown” and “user” managers.
The project of the Prime Minister in the Shadow also means that water companies shareholders can’t take all their shares because the working party government can “exclude” them on the basis of what they have done.
He also confirmed that he plans to enter the corporate board of directors and create group-owned funds to transfer 10% of private sector companies’ capital to employees, which means reaching up to £500 shares annually.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, says to 60 Minutes whether FBI investigations on Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation into prosecutions against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for his candidate for the Supreme Court at least a week, and reminds the question of whether the findings of the office can give any of the Republican Senators to support him.
The 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether FBI findings could change their views.
Kennedy seemed to be clearer than his partner who was Southern California.
Kennedy said, “I think, of course.”
“As I said I went to the court meeting, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened and the claim spread, I contacted him, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was cut off, designed and confident.”
However, Graham's vote seemed irreversible.
“I have declared my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and such charges cannot change it,” he said.
Graham added Christine Blasey Ford: “Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it severely.”
"And whoever calls her name can't confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change my mind.”
What is the World Citizenship Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
New York City will host the World Citizenship Festival which is an annual event of music that runs a very well-known group of stars and also has a very important mission: ending global poverty.
The World Citizenship Festival, which is now in its seventh anniversary, has tens of thousands of people travelled to Great Lawn Central Park to not only enjoy artistic performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise their awareness of the main goal of the event to end severe poverty by 2030.
The World Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is one of the developed sectors of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international support that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of active people in the fight against poverty.
People who want to participate in the concert will be required to receive free tickets (unless wanting to pay the VIP ticket fee) by carrying out a set of tasks or “actions” such as volunteer work, emailing one of the world leaders, calling them, or helping them in any other way to increase information.
But as the world’s citizenship has 12 years of time to reach its goal, how much has it been successful?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, the right way to encourage them to call for action or other kind of "click activism"? - People who have been doing a great job by signing an online book or sending a tweet.
According to the World Citizenship, since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded by its supporters who have been trying to achieve a lot of different goals.
They say these measures have helped to move global leaders and take commitments and policies with cost of over $37 billion so that they can have positive impacts on more than 2.25 billion people in their lives by 2030.
In early 2018, the group indicated 390 commitments and notifications that they had taken out of their actions that at least $10 billion had previously been paid or had been collected by aid.
The group estimates that the assurances have had a direct impact on approximately 649 million people around the world.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, which are a group of UK-based investors and executives who have committed to “aid children to grow and reach their full potential” after receiving more than 4,700 twitters from global citizenship.
The Power of Nutrition Ambassador, Tracey Ullman, spoke to the population during the live concert in April 2018: “With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can break down the malnutrition that is a social injustice and link to history.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures taken on request from the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that the cost required for a nutritional power project, including food intervention for 5 million women and children, was allocated.
In response to one of the questions discussed on his website, “What did you think we could eliminate absolute poverty?”
He said, “This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will eat the earth and won’t succeed.
But like the civil rights movements and the anti-apartment movements that were made before us, we will succeed because we are stronger alongside.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some artists who will perform at the event this year in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use naval forces to prevent Russia’s energy exports.
Washington Examiner, U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke, has announced that Washington could “if necessary” be used to prevent Russia’s energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, into its own marine forces.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly that its activities are conducted to invite the legal government - is a reason for the discovery of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are present in the Middle East is that they want to act for their energy just as they do in the Eastern and Southern Europe.”
And according to this, there are methods and tools to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability to make sure the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not going to the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the presents of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the “Energy Consumer Motion” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to confronting Russia and Iran and said they are practically similar.
While he learned from Russia as a "uniform product supply" with fossil fuels, he said: "The economic option for Iran and Russia, less and less, is the application of influence and replacement of fuels."
The statement suggests that Trump's policy in terms of increasing liquid natural gas exports to Europe and replacing it with Europe's gas, which is considered a cheaper but farer option for European consumers.
In order to achieve this goal, Trump’s government officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to encourage Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, calls Berlin to “build” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the pipeline of $11 billion Nord Stream 2, which is designed to double the existing pipeline capacity and to reach 110 billion square meters, is a mere economic project.
"Cerminlin says Washington is strongly opposed to this project only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after a September meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow, said: “We believe that energy should not be a tool for pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers.
The U.S. situation has caused a severe reaction to Germany and has again emphasized its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has advised the United States to avoid involvement in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a meeting held between Germany’s Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said: “I don’t think it’s offensive for a third state to intervene in our energy supply.”
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will “severely” participate in the 2020 presidential elections
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he would take part in the competition for the presidential elections.
Warren confirmed at the Holyoke Massachusetts City Council that he was looking for a competitor.
According to The Hill, he said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington to make our weak government, including having a woman in the head.
“After November 6, I’ll be seriously looking for a competition for the presidential election.”
Warren at the municipal meeting, in contrast to Donald Trump, said he “is taking the area to the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy,” he said.
Warren has so far sincerely criticized Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said on Friday: “Before we vote, we certainly need FBI investigations.”
However, the findings of a survey published on Friday showed that most of the people in their election field, Warren, are not willing to participate in the 2020 elections.
According to a survey from the Suffolk/Boston Globe political research center, 58 percent of Massachust's potential voters said that the Senate should not participate in the elections.
Twenty-two percent of the company supported in the elections.
The survey showed that people have more support from the former Deval Patrick Governor's company, 38% of its potential company and 48% of its opponents.
Other prominent Democrats whose chances of attending in the 2020 elections are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Associated Press said Biden would officially announce its decision by January.
Sarah Palin pointed to PTSD's son's Track Palin in Donald Trump's election assembly
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent one year in Iraq after notification for the military in September.
He was arrested on Monday night for an accident of domestic violence.
Her mother told Donald Trump in Tulsa Oklahoma: “What happens to my son, what happens to him after his return, I can name other families that feel the negative effects of PTSD and some injuries our soldiers have returned to.
Palin spoke of his son’s arrest as “the great problem that everyone ignores,” and said about his son and other warriors: “They come back in a different way, they come back with the hearts, they come back with their hearts, and they ask if they have respect for what they have given to the country, their friends, and all the air forces.”
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the police office Wasilla, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla Alaska and, given the report on domestic violence and arms, he was accused of domestic violence against a woman.
18 states, as well as D.C., support the challenge of developing new policies against refugees.
Eight states, alongside the Colombian department, support the creation of a legal challenge for the new U.S. policy that prevents asylum donation to victims of escape from criminal groups or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that 18 state representatives and the Washington Department on Friday provided a brief advisory information to the court that challenges asylum policy.
The full name of Shaki in Grace v. Sessions, which the U.S. Union of Civil Liberties presented against Federal Policy in August, is not yet stated.
He said his candidate, along with his “friend’s sons who are a member of the band of criminals,” had abused him, but the U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The government’s attorney, who supported Grace, explained that Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are countries that face problems related to criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy, which led to the repealing order of immigrants, allowed illegal immigrants who had fled from domestic violence, to apply for asylum.
The entire Colombian prosecutor Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy “is ignoring the laws of state, federal and international.”
In the short advisory information he provided, he said, “under the federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the exact facts and conditions of the application, and such exceptions violate this principle.”
The lawyers also argued in the advisory information that, given that there is a lot of probability that entrepreneurs and “necessary work” will be provided and concluded that this policy that prevents immigrants from entering will harm the U.S. economy.
Attorney Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration courts not to give refuge to victims from domestic abuse and violence of criminal groups.
Sessions said in a statement on the 11th of June: “Refugees are available to those who have left their country because of torture or fear due to racism, religion, nationality or membership in certain social groups or political views.
Asylum has never been meant to solve all the problems -- even all the serious -- that people around the world face every day.
Despite the doubled number of injuries, it is hard to find remains in Palu in streams.
The situation was increasingly sharp for the remainder.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while seeing her child’s body injured in a city’s kidnapping center, said: “I feel very bad.”
“Every moment ambulance brings the body.
The water is clean.”
It has been seen that the inhabitants return to their destroyed houses, and come into the midst of their waters, and try to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been injured and destroyed due to a 7.5 earthquake.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his shoulder and back, rested outside the Palu military hospital, where the patients continued after severe strikes.
When he explained his feelings about a strong earthquake in the fifth-storey hotel room where he, his wife, and his daughter were present, he had covered his eyes with tears.
Haris told Associated Press: “We had no time to save ourselves.
“I think I’ve been thrown into the wall breaks,” he added that his family attended a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife crying and wanting help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe.”
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of being "visitating" by Propaganda.
A week after a Chinese official newspaper printed a four-page advertisement in one of the U.S. newspapers on the benefits of the bilateral China-U.S. agreement, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to publish Propaganda advertising.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, which, of course, rejected it, stated that China's Daily cash in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling state newspaper Lowa.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to interfere in the US elections showed what US officials said at Reuters, the start of a new step of reinforcement of pressure on China by Washington.
While an advertisement order for commercial advertising is an ordinary thing for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasing trade war that is causing the imports of mutual goods to be recognized.
Chinese and American experts said China’s aviation identification was designed to strike exporters in states such as Lowa that supported the Republican or Trump’s party.
The U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad in China, who has long been governor of Lowa and is one of the major exporters of agricultural goods to China, Beijing said he has hit workers, farmers and American businesses.
Branstad wrote in an article that was printed in the Des Moines Register: “China is continuing to crash with the printing of propaganda ads in our free press itself.”
Branstad wrote: “The state of China, publishing money ads in the Des Moines Register, is in its promotional distribution taking advantage of the popular tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press in the United States.”
"Instead, you see that there are limited opposition sounds in the press box here in Beijing Street, and there is no real reflection of the opposing views that people may have on the worrying economic path of China, because the media are severely controlled by the Communist Party of China."
“One of China’s most prominent newspapers has failed to accept the press proposal,” he added, of course, not saying what it meant to be.
The expensive analysts warn a republic wanting Kavanaugh to flee women voters from interim elections.
The analysts have warned that many republicans want to face several allegations of sexual abuse, defence the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh and advocate for his elections, this will lead to interactive reaction, especially by women in interim elections.
Emotions that exist in this regard are very much, and the Republicans often want to show that they want to progress with votes.
Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell University School of Syracuse, told The Hill on Saturday: “These things cannot be returned.”
Reeher said he doubted that the second minute support of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) from FBI investigations to calm up angry voters.
According to a Washington newspaper report, Mrs. Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and National Development Group spokesman, MoveOn, said on Friday: “They won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow and November.”
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republic wants to control the elected judicial committee to deal with Kavanaugh, protesters protest on Friday morning at the Senate and shouted “November is on the way!”
Stu Rothenberg, an unparalleled analyst, told the news site: “The passion and motivation of Democrats is increasing.”
“People say that this passion was already above; it’s right.
But it can go higher, especially among women who have doubts, and young 18-29-year-olds who don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before the public testimony of Mrs. Ford, in which the details of her allegations on sexual abuse against the Supreme Court, the analysts have stated that a mutual reaction will occur if the Republic wants to support her.
According to the NBC News report, Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “This issue has become a complicated problem for the GOP.”
Guy Cecil, CEO of Priorities USA, a group that helps winning Democrats in the elections, told the news channel: “The subject is not only a committee vote or final vote or Kavanaugh is judged, but a way the Republic wants to manage the subject and how they behave with him as well.”
Nevertheless, Americans seem to have been ashamed after the testimony made by Ford and Kavanaugh to believe who the word, of course, the second word appears to be a little more admirable.
A new survey conducted by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents certainly believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35% believe in Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh is definitely or probably lying in their testimony, while only 30 percent believe in Ford.
The Guardian reported that after the announcement of Flake’s support, the FBI police are investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least another accused named Deborah Ramirez.
Ford swore to the Senate Judgment Committee last week and testified that Kavanaugh had violated him at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate, while attending Yale in the 1980s, attended a guest together, showed him his body.
Global networking inventors plan to launch new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee is the global networking inventor launching a startup that is looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-text platform Erners-Lee, which is Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their information is stored and who are allowed to access information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the idea behind Inrupt is the “World Kingdom”.
He said, “We have to do this right now.”
“This is a historical moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal data storage space or POD.
This space can contain a list of audiences, works lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
The topic is that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify services are all available at the same time and in a browser.
What makes this online storage space unique is that it completely depends on the user who can access the kind of information.
The company calls this capability “personal capability through information.”
According to John Bruce’s CEO, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the company with the right resources, processes and skills to help put Solid at all.
The company is now Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers that have concluded contracts with them and a set of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their non-focused applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren’t talking to Facebook and Google about creating or lacking a complete change that would allow all of the business models to change them for a half-night.
“We won’t let them.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release on Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the integration and quality of a new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee, when the World Web Concert was created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, transformed the Internet.
Berners-Lee has been an influential face in a network-sided discussion in recent months.
Berners-Lee will remain open even with the launch of Inrupt, the founder and manager of the Global Web Network, the Web Foundation and the Data Foundation.
Berners-Lee added: “I’m very happy with the next season.
Bernard Vann: Victory's cross-receiver was analyzed in World War I.
From the only British church priest who was able to receive the Cross of Victoria as a warrior in the First World War, he was awarded at his birthplace on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the award.
Colonel II Bernard Vann received this award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, four days later, he was killed by a single shooter and never informed that he had received the highest pride of the British military.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was played by his two grandchildren during a festival in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s grandfather’s grandfather, who was proud of the achievement of this, was a “smart and clever” act of his memory.
According to a London Gazette report on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his neck at the Canal de Saint-Quentin “During a blast and under fire heavy balls and guns”.
He later attacked the fire line, and led the line with the "full" lonely and before the ball attack, and led the three groups from the foot.
Colonel Vann was killed by a single German shooter on 4 October 1918 - only a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “what I know I never could be so good, but it’s small.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also posted the song led by the young royal Brentwood group, to put the glow on his memory on the ground.
Michael Vann said, “He feels very proud of having played a role in the game,” and added, “a real hero’s teaching is shown with support from many people.”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206 but instead Peppa Pig was installed.
Imagine that you’ve been awake all night to watch a Bellator 206 just so you don’t watch the main event.
San Jose's account included 13 battles including six battles on the main card that was broadcast live during the night of Channel 5 in England.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a dream with each other, the TV coverage was cut off and the Peppa Pig cartoon was broadcast and the British viewers were amazed and angry.
Some of them felt bad after they were awake to watch the battle until the early hours of the morning.
One of Twitter fans called the program change to the children’s cartoon “a sick joke.”
Dave Schwartz, Chief Marketing and Communications Deputy Bellator, when asked about this change in the program, said, “This is part of the government’s regulations that this content is not suitable at 6:00 p.m. so they were forced to change the program to children’s cartoons.”
"Peppa Pig, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they intend to work on their plans so that they can cover British viewers in the future.
Coker said, “When I think of the release, I think we can see a reminder for it.”
“But in that case, it was Sunday morning at 6 p.m. and we can’t see it until Sunday at our time and Monday at their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this change was done, many messages rejected and changed, and these messages were not friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I promise you that this will not happen in the future.
We will reduce the number of fights from six to five fights - as we do usual - this time we tried to provide additional services to fans and only try it.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feel “Good” for Sexual Tenderness
Sheriff Tom Daley said she was growing up because of her sexual inclination towards everyone – but this motivated him to succeed.
He said that he didn’t realize until he went to high school, “They’re not all like me.”
While in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program run by Lauren Laverne, she spoke out in a loud voice about gay rights to give the rest of her “hope”.
He also said that being a father doesn’t matter anymore.
Kirsty Young, the main advisor of the old program, has been released for several months due to the disease.
Daley, who participated in the first Laverne program, said she felt “worthy” to all other people because “in social terms, love of boys and girls was not acceptable.”
He said, “Today, this feeling of dignity and difference has been real things that have given me power and ability to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that “a person is important,” in a way that when the rest of his sexual desires were informed, he would not disappoint them.
He has become an LGBT campaign fighter who has doubled the winners of the Olympic Bern medal and has used his shared interests in Australia this year, asking more countries to legally declare homosexuality.
He said that he talked thoroughly because he felt lucky that he was able to live clearly and without negative consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world hero said he loved a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black who met him in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Daley married the winner of Oscar, who was 20 years older than herself, but said that the old distance was never a problem.
"When you're so young," he went to the Olympics at the age of 14 for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find a person who had experienced similar ages and injuries.
The couple was born in June with a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said she had changed the "General View".
He said, "If you asked me a year ago, all my attention was to take the gold medal."
“You know what, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medal.
The Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.”
His son, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said her father had not accepted that she would die, and one of the last things she asked was whether she still had the 2012 Olympic tickets - because she wanted to be in front of the band.
He said, “I couldn’t tell him that you wouldn’t be there until you were in front of the band, Father.”
“When she stopped breathing, I held her hand, and when she really breathed and died, I finally realized that she wasn’t failing.”
A year later, Daley won the 2012 Olympics and won the Brans Medal.
"I knew that's what I've been in my dreams all my life -- in front of a crowd of my country in the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," he said.
This was also his inspiration for his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - who was accompanied by him in the Olympics and still has a lot of interest in it.
Desert Island Discs on Channel 4 BBC radio will be broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was sitting on the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson won a new record at the 47th main Ryder Cup race on Sunday, but comes in to prevent it from turning into an unpleasant spot.
Mickelson, who participates in the event for the 12th time a year, was featured by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball games and four-ball games on Saturday.
The great player who has five-time winning history in the letter, rather than attending the center of the game, as often as the United States has attended, spends his day as an activity as a leader of viewers and attempts to improve his game in the field of the ball in hopes that he can remedy his problems.
This 48-year-old player, who has never been the best hit in his gametime, is not the right choice for Le Golf National hard competitions that usually have a deviation of high-speed golf courses around the ground.
And if these competitions are not fascinating enough, Mickelson will face in the nineteenth Sunday competition with the precise British Open hero, Francesco Molinari, which will be held in a team with Tommy Fleetwood to take all four of his matches this week.
If Americans, despite the start of 12 single races, are four points back, have a good start, Mickelson race can be very vital and decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence to his players, of course, he couldn't say anything else.
Furyk said, “He realized the role he had yesterday, he admired me and threw his hand away from me and said he would be ready tomorrow.”
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has earned a lot of pride and this week, these teams have learned a lot from him.
I probably didn’t think he was playing in two games.
I thought it was more than that, but that's how it went and I think we should accept it.
He wants to be like anybody else in the field.”
Mickelson won Nick Faldo's record on Sunday in the field of the highest number of Ryder Championships.
This can be the end of a professional time attending the Ryder Cup, which can never be his personal record well.
Mickelson has 18, 20 losses and seven equals, but Furyk said his presence is an unknown asset for the team.
He explained: “He is funny, funny and jokeful, he loves to meet others and is a great person who is present in the team.
“I think younger players enjoy criticism of him, including this week to be seen.
In addition to the game, it brings us a lot of other things too.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the top of their shortcuts can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows, according to his experience, that taking the last day of the Ryder Championship single competitions with a remarkable superiority can easily become an unpleasant end.
The Danish Open Golf began its work from the 1997 competitions in Valderrama, where a team was in front of Captain Seve Ballesteros five points from the Americans but eventually won nearly 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>214-1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>213.
Bjorn, after watching the 3-5-year-olds on Friday and yesterday, leading to the top 6-10 at Le Golf National, said: “Remember that we had the top in Valderrama, we had the top in Brookline, we lost the top, and we lost in Valderrama, but we lost a bit.”
So history showed to me and all the people in the team that the game was not finished.
Tomorrow you have to go to the field with all the strength.
Go there and do the right thing.
Until the scores on the table are not recorded, the game is not finished.
We have a goal and our goal is to strive to win the championship and your focus must be on that goal.
I’m always focusing on 12 players in our team, but we’re totally aware of the team that’s in front of us – the world’s greatest players.”
Bjorn, happy with the performance of his players in this hard golf competition, added: “I will never judge in this case early.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Tomorrow there are individual functions that specify everything, and this is the different thing we need to do.
When everything goes well, it’s very good to be with a teammate in the field, but when you’re alone in the field, your capabilities are completely tested as an open golfer.
This is the message you need to move to players, offer your best performance tomorrow.
Now, you are leaving your team and he must also go and try to have his best performance.
In contrast to Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk will endeavor to make his players better individual performance than team performance, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who were able to win three points out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both of these great changes last day, he was part of the winner team in Brookline, of course, before Europe managed to perform a "miracle in Medinah" and made him finish the game as a loser.
In answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, prepared his players to start the last day, said, “I remember all the damn words that day.”
“We have 12 important competitions tomorrow, but you like the quick start you’ve seen on Brookline, like what you’ve seen in Medinah.
When the force moves in one direction, it creates a lot of pressure on those who are during the race.
We specify our combination on this basis and helps them as we love, fail, you know we will try to miracle tomorrow.”
The task of fighting has been transformed into Thomas’s leadership and has faced with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half, in the top race with Rory McIlroy.
Bjorn said about his individual choices: “I put this group of people in this way because I think it covers all the areas.
Germany's new war was resumed.
Local media reported that the latest German Navy Navy should be completed in 2014 to replace it with old navy during the Cold War, but due to deficiencies in systems and high costs, at least not ready until the next year.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, a military spokesman was transferred to the mission of sending the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" from the new series of Baden-Wuerttemberg navals until the first half of 2019.
The ship should be joined to the Navy in 2014, but painful problems after delivery, the fate of the project has troubled the candidate.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels that ordered the navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class navy.
It is obvious that these vessels will benefit from a powerful ball, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as several radar technologies such as reducing the performance, red and sound-free.
Other important features are longer-term maintenance – it will probably be possible to use new navals for a maximum of two years away from the coast itself.
Die Zeit wrote: However, the ongoing delays mean that these modern navy - which is said to allow Germany to increase its power in foreign waters - will grow old until it enters the sea.
Last year, when the German Navy officially resigned from the F125 Navo and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, it was a lot of voice in the media.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship after delivery to the shipyard.
There is little information about the reasons for this return, but the German media have reported a severe number of "software and hardware" defects that have used Nao in case of use for the blameless war mission.
Software defects are particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg's vessels will be exploited by a crew of 120 crews - which is only half of the human force of the older Bremen-class navals.
It has also been revealed that the ship is significantly more severe than the standard, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the marine forces to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz ship is estimated to be twice as heavy as compared to the same class ships used by Germany during World War II.
Apart from hardware failures, the total cost of the project - including crew training - is also becoming a shadow.
The cost is estimated to be 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with which new navals are taking into account due to warnings that the German naval forces are falling are particularly important.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Defence Committee, stated that the Navy is really “after the end of stable ships.”
The official said the problem has risen over time, because old ships have gone out of the mission but are not replaced ships.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class navals could join the Navy.
National Trust examines the secret life of secrets.
A new research in part of the Scottish Highlands is being conducted with the aim of identifying the use of the area's shells for food hunting.
The findings of these researches are hoped to reveal a new angle of the behaviour of these birds and to help guide their protection activities in the future.
The research carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland organization follows short-lived limbs and short-lived limbs as well as long-lived ears and limbs in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the area to track down activities during the season.
In addition, NHS employees and volunteers will make mobile planning using manual detectors.
Specialized analysis of the sound of all the recorded items, the frequency of the sound of the fractures, as well as whatever works.
Then a map and report of their habitat will be created to provide a detailed image in the area of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection adviser for NTS, hoped that the results of the research would specify which habitat areas are more important to the crash and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of life management measures, including creating forests and how to preserve forests in the best way for cattle and other related species.
Over the past centuries, the population of shells in Scotland and throughout the UK has been significantly reduced.
They are threatened by building works and developments that affect their slopes and cause their life to be destroyed.
Body and light turbines can also be dangerous for them, as well as insect papers and some chemical compounds of building products as well as attacks of cats.
The flowers aren't really blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, when the subject of hunting is given taste, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a complex research technique to determine the exact location of insects and obstacles on their flight pathway.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares from lands across the country, takes the subject of the crashes very seriously.
They have trained ten specialists who regularly conduct maping operations, checking the balloons, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even identified Threave lands in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the living room of eight of the ten species of Scotland, as the first and only protected area of Scotland.
District Director David Thompson says that the area is the ideal locality for them.
He said, “Here in Threave, we have a very suitable area for crashes.”
“We have old buildings, many old trees, and all the proper habitats.
“But there are lots of things that are still unknown, so what we do here and other areas will help us to realize what other things they need to grow.”
He emphasized the importance of examination of the existence of turkeys before repair operations in the buildings, because it may lead to the death of up to 400 turkeys and youth, which will likely lead to the destruction of a total local population.
It is unlawful to protect, kill, harm, and create resilience for them, and to eliminate their blows.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish leader of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged people to help with seriousness.
He said, “We still have to learn a lot about our flowers and for many of our species, we still don’t know how their population continues to live.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and lawyers seriously follow the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo learned of the allegations of abuse against him as “fake news” and said that people “will make their name known by using his name.
He is looking for a complaint from the German newspaper Der Spiegel that has printed these claims.
The Portuguese and United States team attacker was accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a room in one of Las Vegas hotels in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday: He was claimed to pay $375000 to the woman to keep her silent about the incident.
Ronaldo, 33-year-old, who talked with his 142 million followers at Leo Instagram, severely rejected these claims and called them "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
The five-time winner of the golden ball said to the camera: "What they said today is false news."
“They want to make their own fame by using my name.
This is natural.
They want to be famous for taking my name, but this is part of my work.”
The player added with a smile: “I am a happy person and everything goes well.”
According to Reuters, Ronaldo is preparing for a complaint from Der Spiegel about the allegations that it is called “an invalid report of unproven data in the privacy area”.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player was looking to get rid of “spiritual injury in proportion to the attractiveness of this injury, which is probably one of the most serious injuries that have been done in the field of individual rights in recent years.”
The allegation occurred in June 2009 in Suiti at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the existing documents of the Clark District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga have returned to the room after meeting the nightclub, claiming that Ronaldo has violated him from the seat.
Mayorga argued that after this, Ronaldo came to the knees and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" and "one percent" bad.
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that these two people had a sexual relationship but said that it was satisfied.
Mayorga also claimed she went to the police and took pictures of her surgery in the hospital, but later agreed outside of the court because she felt “the fear of the telefighting” and worried about the “public incarceration”.
The 34-year-old woman said it is now seeking to conclude the agreement due to the continued mental injury of the alleged incident.
During the assault, Ronaldo was in a separate position from Manchester United and joined the Real Madrid, and this summer joined a 100 million euro agreement to the Italian team of the United States.
Choice: Loss of cars for the UK will seek “every-every-being Muslim”
Greg Clark, British Minister of Commerce, said that if after the election, Britain will lose its position as a global leader in the automotive, this will "be a cause of their eternal recklessness."
“It is a ‘disturbed’ that the UK’s Twitter unit told BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without agreement, it will temporarily suspend production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
Mr. Clark said, “We need a deal.”
The Japanese automobile said the impact of border delays in the event of an option without agreement could end at the price of destruction of jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which produces Auris and Avensis Toyota - has produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which have been exported to other EU countries.
Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston, said: “My point is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without agreement, we will be witnessing to stop producing at our factory.”
Other British cars, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concerns about leaving the European Union without agreement on how trade operations on the border.
For example, BMW says one month after choosing, its Mini production factory will be held in Oxford.
The main concern about what automotives say is related to the risks of the supply chain in the event of withdrawal without agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on the right time principle, in a way that parts from suppliers of the UK and the European Union arrive at the factory every 37 minutes to be ordered by cars.
If Britain leaves the European Union without agreement on March 29, it may cause disturbances at the borders that industries say this can lead to delays and deficiency of parts.
Toyota said it would be impossible for us to maintain its assets at the Derbyshire factory for more than a day, and so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Mrs. Theresa May's plan for future relations with the European Union is "really designed to prevent these problems at the border."
“We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal to allow us not only to succeed now but also to give us the opportunity to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said.
“The issue that was raised not only by Toyota but also by other producers is that they said we should be able to continue to use this successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not say how long the production will stop, but warned that in the long run, these additional costs could reduce factory competitiveness and eventually lead to loss of employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and the Union call officer of Unite, said that the concerns of Union members are growing: “On the basis of my experience when these jobs disappear, they will never be restored again.
A government spokesman said: “We need to put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House announced on Sunday, with the proceedings on High Court nomination Brett Kavanaugh, a risk-free meeting with Donald Trump, Deputy General Attorney Rod Rosenstein, “may be delayed another week.”
Rosenstein monitors the role of Robert Mueller’s special adviser in investigating Russia’s involvement in Russia’s elections and communication between Russia and Trump’s aids and preventing the possible president’s execution of justice.
Whether Trump is expelling the Deputy Prosecutor's General or, as a result, threatening Mueller's independence, has led to the formation of complaints in Washington in recent months.
A long time ago, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had the subject of having a microphone to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president’s isolation through a 25-year reform.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday, despite reports on the resignation, went to the White House.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at the time in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Friday.
Trump said he wouldn't prefer to release Rosenstein, but the meeting was commissioned to prevent it from interfering with the hearing of the court committee, in which Cavana and Dr. Christine Billy Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, had been accused.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate further a week on allegations against Kuwait, and the Beninusile made more delays in the court.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's deputy press assistant, was prepared on Sunday in the Fox News program.
When asked him about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: “The history of this issue is not determined, this week may be, given other issues that pass in the Great Dean, may be replaced another week.
But let’s see what’s happening and I always want to give the latest news to the press.
Some journalists disagree with the statement: Sanders did not hold a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace has asked why this is the case.
Sanders said that the lack of information provided about these meetings was not because they were not interested in “attributing attention” to TV reporters, although he said: “I am not opposed to the fact that they are looking for the media.”
He then proposed an increase in direct contact with Trump and the press.
“The president takes more questions and answers than the former president,” he added, without mentioning evidence, “we have looked at the numbers.”
The summary of the meeting is still offered, but if the press has the opportunity to talk directly to the President.
We are trying to hold more meetings, and you have witnessed many such meetings in the past weeks, and when you can talk to the US President, this is what will take place instead of press meetings.”
Trump will answer questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends free meetings or press conferences along with top-range officials.
Individual press conferences rarely occur.
This week, the president in New York may have shown the reason for this, and was freely and strangely attending the gathering of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to EU employees at the National Health and Treatment Organization of Scotland on the concerns of particularly existing choices.
The Minister of Health expressed their appreciation to the employees of the European Union of employment at the National Health and Treatment Organization for Scotland and urged them to remain in the post-election stage.
Jean-Fremen, a Scottish parliamentary member, wrote a letter in which he stated that less than six months left the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to pay the costs of applying for final situations relating to EU citizens working in weakened public services organizations.
Mrs. Freman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the outbreak of the EU have been on the path of these negotiations towards the predicted decisions that will be made in the autumn.
But the British government is also increasing its preparedness for non-consensus scenarios.
I know that it should be very unsettling for you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I am worth for each member now, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues across the European Union and even outside it bring together valuable experiences and skills that will strengthen and improve the healthcare sector and benefit patients and the communities I serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christine Abarcrombie is headed under emergency surgery after injury.
According to a report by Mike Morgan from Tennessee, Christian Abarkromby, the defender of the Tennessee team of Stey Tygers after a head failure on Saturday 31-27, he went to Windbreet Commuderz under emergency surgery.
Rade Reed, a Tennessee State surgeon, told reporters that the injury occurred a few minutes and a half ago.
And he said, He came to the edge of the line, and then fell to the ground.
Coaches and medical staff before placing avarcromby on Brandard and transferring him to carry out more examinations on the edge of oxygen.
An official official from the Tennessee State to Chris Harris from the WSMV network in Neville, Tennessee said the surgeon of avarcromby at the Medical Center and Windbrillet had ended.
“There are no details about the type and level of injury, and Tennessee Stein is trying to find out when the injury has been introduced.
The second year’s athlete Abkerromby is spending his first season with Tennessee State after transfer from Elenoise.
She had five full matches on Saturday before she left the game, which increased her number of matches to 18.
Foreign buyers are charged with more tax expenses when buying real estate in the United Kingdom.
Foreign real estate buyers in the United Kingdom will be charged with more tax expenses, and additional expenses will cost helping homeless under the cover of new theory plans.
This move will lead to the success of the Kurbin plan to attract young voters.
The increase in tax rates will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury ministry predicts that this amount will increase to £120 million annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are determined to pay more taxation costs when buying real estate in the United Kingdom – and the extra amount to be received for helping homeless people, the news that Teresa will announce today.
This move is considered to be an attempt to stimulate the success of Jeremy Kurbin to attract young voters with promise to provide cheaper housing and target higher incomes.
Increased tax rates will apply to people and companies who do not pay taxes, and the excess amount of the plan will help the government move to fight the problem of sleep cards.
This additional fee – which is over the taxation fee and includes the higher taxes announced two years ago on the second and then rented houses, will be up to 3%.
The Treasury ministry predicts that the move will have up to 120 million pounds per year.
Nearly 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom, causing price rise and harder purchase conditions for first homes.
Many regions of the country – particularly in the capital – have become “spiritual city” due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy began just a few weeks after Boris Johnson began to reduce the tax burden to help young people become owners.
He accused large building companies of keeping the price of the property high due to land and injury, and asked Mrs. May to leave a share of cheaper houses to provide "inhabitation" in Britain.
Mr. Kerbin has offered a set of interesting suggestions for housing reforms, which includes checking for home rental and ending the cancellation without errors.
He also wants to give city courts more options to build new homes.
“I said last year that I will give the prime minister the first priority to restore Britain’s dreams – that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that we will resolve the problem of the malignant housing market.
The doors of the UK are always open to those who want to build work and new life here.
However, it’s not true that buying a house for people who don’t live here or that foreign companies are as easy as Britain’s residents.
For many people, the dream of ownership looks very far away and the shame of a dream carton is really ridiculous.”
Jack Ross: “My long-term management is Scotland.”
Jack Ross, president of Sanderland, says his “finity high priority” is becoming Scotland’s manager in the future.
The 42-year-old Iscat enjoys the northeastern club, which is facing the difference between three points from the chairman of the table in the third league.
After the last season re-oriented St. Mary's to the top League, he moved this summer to the lighting stadium.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.”
Russell said to the BBC Sports Radio, “I’ve earned grade B, that’s just that.”
“But since I was a kid, I grew up with my father watching Scotland in his homeland, and that’s what always attracts me.
However, this is only the opportunity to get people to succeed in the management of the club.”
The former presidents of Sanders include Dick Edwards, David Moyce, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Sur Ken, Gas Point, and Paolo de Conejo.
The former club leader of Alva Atletic said there was no fear of such credible names that were looking for the great club, and had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich proposals.
“Now the success criterion for me is, ‘Can I return this team to the top league?’
He said that because of the structure and facilities of the club, he certainly belongs to the top league.”
“It’s not easy to get a team to the top, but if I can get the team back, I’ll be successful.”
After spending a course as a manager in Dambarton and a 15-month training course, he has only been managed for three years.
He then turned them back to the third class of the Alawa team, and the following season transformed St. Marin from the team to the winner of the championship.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he plays in Clyde, Hartlepole, Falker, St. Mary and Hamilton Academy.
He learned from taking responsibility for the team of Alowa that “it may have been a real point of passion.”
I definitely believed that my proper management was much more than playing.
It seems strange because when I was good, I built a good life for myself and enjoyed a reasonable social position.
Playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to do throughout the week.
I’m still under stress and work pressure, but I feel that management is very good for me.
I always wanted to manage it and now I do it, this is the best feeling I’ve ever felt in my life in adults.”

The summer warmth wave has increased sales of cabins in the UK, but has brought a lot of pressure on chain restaurants.
Statistics show that the group of houses and many times saw a sales increase of 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant sales declined 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business advisor, who was responsible for collecting statistics, said: "The sun continues and participates longer than expecting Britain to be at the World Cup, meaning that July will follow the same pattern as before June, when the houses will have a 2.8 percent increase in sales.
Restaurant sales decreased by 1.8% in June in July.
The houses serving drinks and many times had a stronger performance than their own in most restaurants that saw a decline in sales.
The houses that serve food have also suffered from heat, but not severely restaurants.
People seem to go out just to drink.
Beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent this month and food sales declined by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s welfare and hospitality analyst, said: “This shows the continuing results we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales at home, the climate and the impact of sports and social events are the most important factors.
It’s not surprising that the group of restaurants is still in the marketplace, of course, a 4.8% drop in sales every year due to the continued increase in cost pressures that exist will be much more painful.
This hot and long summer couldn't get out of time for food shops at the worst time, and it'll determine whether the cold weather we experienced in August will provide a bit of a very time-use of these jobs."
The increase in total sales of houses and restaurants, in addition to new establishments, was 2.7 per cent in July, indicating a decrease in market sales of new products by large brands.
The U.S. industry's supervisory system for the sales of houses, bars and restaurants relates to operational data related to 47 groups operating, which totals their financial turnover to £9 billion, collects and analyzes and counts an authentic standard in the industry.
One of the five children has hidden social media accounts that their parents don't know about.
Research shows that every five children – some of them only 11 years old – have hidden accounts on social networks that their parents and teachers don’t know about.
Research conducted from 20,000 students is the indicator of the growth of "Instagram's counterparty pages".
This report raises concerns about the release of sexual content in these accounts.
20 percent of students said they had an "original" user account to show their parents.
One of the five children – some even up to the age of 11 – hold social networking accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
In a study of 20,000 students who used the course of guidance revealed rapid growth in “Insta’s counterfeit accounts” – a reference to a Instagram photo sharing site.
This report raises concerns about the release of sexual content in these accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they had a pure “original” account to show to parents, while other secret accounts.
A mother who had accidentally been hiding her 13-year-old girl’s hiding site noticed a teenager’s girl’s request to “rape me.”
A study conducted by the U.S. Digital awareness and the MHC Conference of Independent Schools found that 40% of people have two profiles aged 11 to 18 and half of them admitted that they have hidden seats.
Mike Bouchanan, HMC’s head, said: “It’s very sad that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers are not able to find them.
Elide Davil will be at the Scottish Sports Board of Sports.
Elide Davil was elected as the non-profit director of the Scottish Sports Board at the current annual General Assembly of the Government.
Doyle is Scotland's most prominent athlete in two fields, and Len Betty, Chairman of the Board of Directors, knew this movement as an opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of his extensive experiences in the past decade on the international level.

Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Advertisings relating to breast pumps compared to mothers with cows lead to smoking online reviews.
A breast pump company according to the advertising of breast milk mothers with cows that their milk is showered, causes smoking in online reviews.
The Elvie Consumer Technology Company has released a funny video to inspire the release of the freedom of the new pump to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a warehouse full of cows with music, which is the following poems: “Yes, I lie myself, but you don’t see any dumbness” and “If you didn’t notice these are not cows breasts, they are my breasts.”
She continued: “I give the kids milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk.”
However, this advertisement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has led to a discussion in virtual space.
The video with 77,000 views and hundreds of views received different reactions from the audience, which many said this video would joke the Lebanon industry.
“Using cow to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
“People like us have to be pregnant and be born in order to produce milk, unless their children are stolen after a few days of birth.”
The Elvie breast pump is hidden inside the nurses/manages (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said: “It is understandably ridiculous for the mother and the baby.
But why shouldn’t we use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who hold their children?”
Someone else added, “What uncomprehensible advertising.”
Some have supported the advertisement, such as a woman who claims to be “a pleasure.”
“I think this is a bad idea.
If I had given my child milk again, I would have had one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement was a bit stupid, but I accepted it as it was.
The personal writing is a smart product.”
Another person said: “This is an interesting ad and it’s the conversation of mothers who pump their milk (often at work or in a shower) and stop them from being “gao” feeling.
This is not an advertisement to admire or judge the liquor industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they all danced with hidden pumps in their breasts.
The concept behind this advertisement is a belief that most women who pump their milk say that feeling cow makes them gain.
Nevertheless, the Elvie pump is completely soundless, wireless or pipeless and is hidden inside the chest and allows women to move freely, keep their babies and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarine, a co-worker and psychologist of children’s growth at the mother’s organization, said Elvie’s pump is like a revolutionary product that is a challenging introduction and debate.
We wanted to put the breast pumps and all of its challenges in the same way, while showing a fun and understandable sense of freedom that these pumps will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie Titer pump is reported.
During the week of London fashion, two children appeared on the fashion scene while using this product for fashion designer Marta Yakobuski.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to the tent camp at the Texas border.
Although statistics on illegal crossing from the border have been relatively stable, the number of detained immigrants has significantly increased, part of which is due to Trump's harsh words and policies that have made it harder to find a defender for children.
Previously, most of their immigrants were missing legal evidence, so they are afraid that they will be threatened by moving forward to support their children in the country.
When federal officials announced that potential defenders and adults of their families should give fingerprints, and this information is shared with immigration officials, the risk of this work increased.
Last week, Matthew Albans, an immigration and immigration organization’s chief official at the Congress, testified that the agency has arrested thousands of people who have registered to support children.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of people arrested had no previous credit history.
“Nearly 80% of those who were defended or who were defended from the family are illegally living in the country and many of them are foreign criminals.
We are looking for those people.”
Asylum workers said, in order to accelerate the process of childcare, officials announced a new law that, on the basis of the previous standard that enabled the presence of the court 60 days after the arrest, some of these children were obliged to attend the court a month after the arrest.
Many are present in place of personal presence to defend themselves to obtain the legal status of residence against an immigrant judge through a video conference.
Those who are not eligible for legal support are quickly expelled.
Asylum workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months, the more children are in jail, the more they are exposed to stress and anxiety, which can lead to violence or action.
The fans stated that concerns in larger centers such as Ternilo, where signs related to the problem of having a child may be ignored due to the size of the center.
They added the transfer of children to tent towns without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause an exaggeration of the spiritual hit that many are currently fighting with.
Syria has ordered the “Occupational Neighbors” of the United States, France and Turkey to be expelled immediately.
The Syrian Foreign Minister Willid Madi said at the United Nations General Assembly that despite the war in the country in its eighth year, he called for the Avaragans to return to their homes.
The teacher, who also has the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally fighting terrorism in Syria, and will be appropriate to deal with them.”
He said: “They must be out of the country without any condition as soon as possible.”
The war against terrorism has almost ended in Syria, a war in which more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been deported from their homes.
"This sacred war will continue until we cleanse all parts of Syria from terrorist groups and the presence of any illegal foreign forces," he said.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and providing advice to the forces and treating Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land forces in one country.
The teacher said that the conditions were appropriate for their return, and some of the Western countries disturbed it for creating unreasonable fears that make the Aryans stay away from Syria.
He said, “We have asked international societies and humanitarian organizations to provide the facility of this return.”
They make a matter that is just friendly to human beings to become a political issue.
The U.S. and the European Union have warned that no assistance to Syria will be granted until an agreement between the USSR and the opponent for the end of the war is made.
The United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Syria and Turkey was built in the most important Soviet base region in Addibha, which created an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented large-scale Syrian forces from attacking a place where three million people live.
Nevertheless, the teacher stressed that the memorandum has a “specific mandate” and hopes that military operations will target the hostiles that include warriors of the Nazi front dependent on Al Qaeda.
Stephen Demistora, the United Nations representative, hopes to form the first meeting of the new committee consisting of government and opposition party members to write a constitutional draft post-war for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
The teacher explained the circumstances of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee and said the employee should be restricted to “the investigation of constitutional matters” and warned about interventions.
Why Trump won a long time later?
With this logic, Trump will win the re-election 2020 unless the liberal observers are hoping that his discretion and discretion will end it before the end of his presidential period.
“The end of the U.S. presidency will be the most exciting end!”
There is currently no sign of the treatment of observers.
Since 2014, the watch ranking has been more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and the nearly three-fold increase to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Neilson Fox News, 2.4 million watch watches were 1.7 million people four years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Mado" program with more than 3.5 million viewers in the main news nights reached the highest rank among cable television shows.
Neil Bayer, a serial producer of the ABC network, said about a cabinet minister who after the attack caused the collapse of Congress, “This is a fire that people are thrown into because it’s not something we understand.”
Neil Scool, a comic writer and writer, “only funny sections: and a few difficult facts about the Hollywood Boys Club,” has another theory.
He remembered before the 2016 election that one day he was riding a taxi in Boston.
The driver told him he wanted to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asks why?
"Mrs. Scool said to me, 'He said, 'Because it makes me laugh.'"

Money sources from outside became the hardest of the interim election competitions.
It’s not surprising that the 17th area of Pennsylvania has a representative of the Congress that has made the competition of two competitors on a chair, seeing money gaining itself.
This has recently led to the restoration of a regional Democratic Party in the town of Pittsburgh. The long-term consortium – who won in the special regional elections last spring.
He is competing with another electoral competitor, the Republican Refugee Kit, who has recently been a 12-year-old Pennsylvania candidate and has interfered with the new 17-year-old area.
These maps were subsequently changed after the Declaration of the Great Greater Ancient Regions was divided in January against the Constitution and in an unfair way to the benefit of the Republic.
Competition in the new 17th area led to the launch of heavy financial roots of the large parties, namely between the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Representative National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
A long name after a close competition and victory in the special elections held in March for the 18th Congress area, many of which witnessed, fell to the head of the language.
The chair was managed by the Republican Party for a decade and Donald Trump won 20 points in the region.
Political experts had a positive view of the Democrats.
The U.S. has stopped the amount of sanctions in Saudi Arabia to support China.
Diplomats have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have now accepted Beijing with a little distance from Washington.
Mr. Trump and President Juan Carlos Warla, the President of Panama, had a celebrated meeting in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until Trump’s management team’s partners were dismissed.
Heather North, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said in a statement earlier this month that foreign ministry officials decided to call U.S. senior officials from the diplomatic mission of Saloudou, the Dominican Republic and the Panama due to the "recent design to not support Taiwan".
But only the penalties were applied to Salvador, who received about $140 million financial aid for controlling drugs, development and financial support from the Americans.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and the application of visa restrictions, had a painful impact on the central U.S. country and the high unemployment rate and the number of murders.
Upon meetings, Northern and Central American officials have replaced a high-level conference with security and economic growth to participate in a similar meeting last year that came forward in an attempt to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, high-based government officials clearly announced that they would like to continue the conference, in order to effectively end any investigation into the Salaud penalties.
The diplomats said it was planned to shame Mike Pence, Vice President, at the conference, which will be held in mid-October, which indicates the importance of the government to this community.
And three American ambassadors quickly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any serious warning and punishment from Washington.
Three U.S. officials who were diplomats and agreed to remain unknown in-house negotiations, said Mr. Bolton's White House spokesman refused to discuss details explained by three U.S. officials.
Their description was confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the government to remain unknown to circumstances.
History Study
The next inevitable event can be a report by Robert Mueller, a special adviser, on the possible prevention of Trump in law enforcement, which has sufficient evidence and evidence in this case in public opinion.
According to the report, Mr. Muller is based on his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign has denied Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its side, Mr. Trump will prepare himself for a dream with voters, responding to Congress and perhaps finally see a fair board of his companions.
Of course, but if there is much, and I don't mean the fall of Mr. Trump or his colleagues in Europe is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean we all have to make decisions about how long this will take effect.

The path of history around the axis of such emotions rotates and the unstoppable revolt democracy or becomes fast.
Now the Americans are facing a number of points of anger.
What would we do if Mr. Trump expels the Deputy Prosecutor General Rhode Rescendan the man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Since the time of publication of the news last year, Rensentain, based on his Penhaad, has been in trouble to record the secret talks of the President and to express his views on Trump's inappropriate character for the President.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is not accurate.
"What will we react if new FBI investigations are not complete or fair from Bret-Kawana, or despite the existence of accusations of sexual rape and false testimony, are they being brought to the Supreme Court?
And most importantly, are we going to vote to the Congress that will respond to Mr. Trump in the midterm elections?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czechoslovakia who was transferred to the Ashwich arrest by the same Nazi regime that occupied my embassy house.

The worries about the retirement of sleep is taken from the eyes of women.
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, some of them were talking about it with their families.
About half of the people in this study said they were talking to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
Halli Ashnaider, Vice-insurance company Vide said: “People want to take care of one of their family members, but they aren’t going to talk to them.”
This is where we have to start.
Talk to your wife and children: If you do not specify your wishes at the right time before, you cannot prepare your family for care.
Talk to your legal adviser and family about the location and how to get care, as these elections can be an impressive factor in determining costs.
Help your financial adviser: Financial adviser can help find a solution to pay expenses.
Your financial choices for long-term care may include a wide range of long-term insurance, or life insurance based on the value of money to cover these expenses or self-dependence with your own wealth - until you have money.
Keep your legal evidence: you will win the field in the legal edges.
Provide a healthcare lawyer to determine a reliable person to monitor your medical care and, if you are unable to communicate, make sure that experts will agree with your requests.
Also, consider the use of the letter of the lawyer in financial cases.

Federal prosecutors are rarely seeking death penalty for New York terrorist attack suspects
The federal prosecutor in New York is looking for death penalty for Sivalo Sipoo, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, which led to the death toll of eight people - a rare punishment that has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Sipoo used a home depot rental truck to terrorize the bike on the road on the West Side in Manhattan downstairs, whereby he took off the riders and bicycles in October.
According to a statement of death sentences recorded in the Southern New York Court, prosecutors will be forced to demonstrate the death penalty that Cyprus has killed eight victims “deeply” and caused them serious physical injuries.
According to the Court’s documents, both of them are likely to be sentenced to death.
Weeks after the attack, a Supreme Court of Justice of the Federal Sipovo held a 22-poverty, which included eight poverty charges of murder by aid, a federal prosecutor who is usually used to refer to organized crimes, and a charge of violence and destruction.
The prosecutors stated that the attack was necessary for a “precisive and very precise and designing software” and expressed in the description of what Saipuo has done that his action was “arrogant, cruel and absurd.”
In the statement of the crime, Siflah حبيب الله ovich Saipuo has caused injuries, injuries and deaths by family members and friends of Diego Henrique Angelini, Nicolas Claus, Darren Derek, Ariel Arlige, Hernan Frankoi, Hernan Diego and Guadeloupe.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.

Both were killed by an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court's case, the Cipuo, a Native of Pakistan, did not declare warning over the days and months after the attack.
Police said he had told the officers that he had a good feeling of what he did.
According to a report requested in Kefer, Cypoo told the officials that the terror motivation was created after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police also stated that he had also asked for the flag of ISIS to take the hospital.
He has proclaimed innocence about 22 people.
David Paton, one of the federal advocates, who is responsible for Yapuvo’s attorney, said that “they are clearly desperate from the judge’s decision.”
"We think the decision to execute death penalty instead of agreeing with the request of a criminal based on the execution of eternal imprisonment without the possibility of freedom only a spiritual strike of these events will be longer for those involved.

The Conservative Party of Parliament says Nigel Freud must be responsible for election negotiations
Nigel Fragž said: “The Army will move the people today in opposition to the Conservative Labour Conference.
The former leader Yukipe said that politicians must “confront with the pressure of opponents closely between the UK and the European Union” – as one of the parliamentary members suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Board of Public Affairs, told Bermuda leaders that if Mr. Fragh was elected Secretary, Britain had gone away so far.
But the challenge with which Ms. M. May faces the challenge of sharing the smuggling members of her cabinet is to be seen by the supporters of the British Protestant Party working groups to remain in the European Union who are joining a separate opposition against the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to pursue a plan of departure without agreement between the attacks of elected defenders, the defenders to remain in the EU and the European Union.
The allies insisted that despite severe reactions, he would try to make a deal with Brussels – and force close opposition forces between the UK and the European Union and the Working Party to choose between his proposals or ‘George and Marge’.
Mr. Bonn leave the meeting, that is, leave that took place in Sulli Hull, stated that he wants to “stop the plan of exit without agreement.”
He suggested that Mr. Fragž should take into account colleagues for the responsibility given for Brussels negotiations.
He said, “If he had the responsibility, we would have gone out so far.”
He added: “I am serving for the election, but we need to stop the plan of leaving without agreement.”
While he expressed his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We haven’t been in the world wars to be frightened.
We want to regulate our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn rejected the issue that the public has changed since 2016. “This is the idea that the British people have changed their views and the demands of remaining in the European Union are completely false.”
André A. Jenkins, a member of the Conservative Labour Party, was also in a critical position and told reporters: “I have to say simple: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
There is no popularity in the public, opponents will not vote against it, our party and our political activists, who are actually active in the streets, and who cause us to be elected as representatives, are not interested in this plan.
Please leave the plan without agreement and start listening.
He added in a remarkable message to Mrs. Maya: Prime Ministers maintain their position when they obey their promises.
Qay Farage told leaders that if the politicians were to put down the decision taken in 2016, they should be forced to “confront the pressure.”
He said, “This is about trust between us, people and the political class.”
They want to betray Britain from the European Union, but we are here today to tell them, “We will not allow you to enter the palace.”
He added in a message to the desirable population: “We want to form our political group from you, so that those who are in the face of betrayal to leave the UK from the European Union will be confronted with pressure.
“We will move the people of this country’s army, which causes our victory to leave the UK from the European Union, and never calm down until we have an independent, self-sacrificed and proud Britain.”
At the same time, defenders staying in the European Union, before spending two-hour assemblies in the center of the city, were up to Bermingham.
After the Conservative Party’s Opposition Working Group started its work on the weekend, a few activists, the party’s banners, rejected the party.
Lord Adonis, a working party member, put the conservation of workers at the same time as the opening of the conference due to the security issues of a party program.
“These are people who tell us that they can install IT systems and prepare all the technologies necessary for Canada to have the Plasma Plasma to have a free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
This is a joke game.
He said there was nothing called a good UK exit from the European Union.
Warren wants to think carefully about his nomination for the president.

Boston Globe reports that the Democrats of the Massachusetts spoke about its future during the monthly session on Saturday in the West Massachusetts.
Warren, always critic Donald Trump, will be nominated for re-elections in November to compete against the representative of the Republican Party, Jeffrey Dihl, who was the president of the Massachusetts Trump's elections in 2016.
He was at the center of the idea of women who said he might be a Trump competitor in the 2020 elections.
On Saturday afternoon in Hollywood, his thirty-sixth session was with voters, which has been held in the form of a public meeting with the people since Trump’s president.
One of them asked if he wanted to be nominated for the presidency.
Warren said, “It is now time for women to go to Washington to reform and rebuild our government, and this requires a woman to be in high rank.”

Russia's Grand Prix: After the team made the victory of Louis Hamilton on Sebastian Talt, Louis became another step closer to the world.
On Saturday, from the moment Walter Butas came forward from Louis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes team would play a lot in the race.
Butas had a good start from the first line and was almost separated from Hamilton to defend his position in the first two pitches and allowed Till to attack his team together.
Tal was the first person to enter Pitt Stapeh and let Hamilton get into the last car traffic, the issue that was definitely happening.
A long time later, Mercedes entered Pitt Stape and appeared behind Wall Street, but Hamilton fell forward after a few moves very close to the side of the car as the driver ran away from the middle of the road and after a double movement risked to go to third place to John.
Max Warsaw started the rear race and became the seventh at his 21th birthday, at the end of the first round.
Then in most of the time of the race he was the first person, and he did not replace his tyres because he wanted to quickly finish the line and take off from Kimmy Raikon and become fourth.
He finally entered Pitt Stop in the forty-fourth round, but couldn't increase his speed over the remaining eight rounds and became the fourth icon.
It was a hard day because Walter had done a wonderful job this weekend and made a really young man who allowed me to give up.
Hemelton said that the team has done exceptional things to have two winner.”
The non-computing was really bad.
President Donald Trump laughed at a meeting on Saturday, Senator Dayan Finestin, for the lack of disclosure of the contents of the letter by Christian Blasi Ford on the allegation of sexual abuse of Bret-Kawana, a great dealer.
The president who was speaking in the electoral assembly in West Virginia directly witnessed Ford's testimony in the Senate Judgment Committee, but instead said what was going on in the Senate shows how much people are "spoke, dirty and liars."
The president said, “What can happen in Sena and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days is that when you see anger, you see people who are nervous, posted, jealous and liar.”
“They publish and reveal the news, and then they say, ‘Oh, I did not.’”
“I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Diane Finestin, have you revealed this?
Remember the answer... have you disclosed the document? "Oh, oh, what do you say?"
"Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
Well, wait a minute.
He adds to the Senator’s voice, “Did we reveal the news?...No, we didn’t do it.
They sent a letter to Finnish, which made Ford accusations against the Cavanate last July, and the contents of the letter were disclosed in early September - but Finnish denied that it was disclosed from his office.
I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t reveal him the issue.” This is part of the Hill’s report, reporting Finestin’s statements in the committee.
“He asked me to keep this secret and I did so as he wanted to.”
But his rejection was not convincing to the president, and he criticized during the election meeting on Saturday night, saying, “I tell you what really happened, the issue of unknown communication was really bad.”
Maybe he didn't do that, but the worst unknown connection I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court, who accused his three wives of sexual immorality, he said that Democrats used charges to their own benefit.
“They are designed to take away power from any possible way.
The reporter Maddie Ethite reported that he said, “You see health and maliciousness, it doesn’t matter to whom they are injuring and who they are rejected to reach power and power.”
Top League: Danny Stars 5-3 has taken place in advance.
Patrick Dyer won two flowers in the match with Dandy's team.
The Dandy Stars team defeated on Friday in the top league against Belfast and won the team back on Saturday 5 out of 3.
With the attacks of Patrick Dyer and Francis Bowler, Vannetz was able to play in the first game with two flowers.
Mike Salvawan and Jordan Conney equated the game, but then won the top flower for a replacement.
Franko Bochard equated the game for Dandy, but Lucas Landwald Nielsn still entered the door of two flowers of Dandy winning.
This was the third top league defeat in this season for men Adam Bags, who were able to defeat 2 on 1 on Friday night at Balfest Dandy.
This was the fourth season between the two teams, while the placentz had played three matches before his own team.
The first flower of the game was acquired by a tournament in the fourth minute at 3:35 minutes with Candal McCall Pass, and four minutes later, Boweler won the second flower with David Rothford Pass.
He was half of Perehia, and Salavan returned the host team to play at 13:10 minutes, but Matthew Markor helped in 15:16 to hit the same flower cone.
When the tournament won his second flower at the end of that night, he was convinced that the placement was the first half of the game.

The air traffic control officer rescued his life by saving hundreds of people on planes to escape from the earthquake.
Indonesians have called them heroes responsible for air traffic control due to suicide on a safe plane that had hundreds of humans.
After a large earthquake on Sunday on the island of Sulaiaki, and after that, more than 800 people were killed, and a large number of people were missing.
So the severe larvae continues to distort life in the region, and many people have been caught under the wall of the city of Palo.
But although his colleagues fled to preserve their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Ganavan Agagan did not leave his post on the control tower that was severely frightened at the airport of Sis al-Joufry at Palo.
He stayed there to make sure that the 6321 Batch airplane, which was at the time on the band, could be relieved.
And when he sees the tower breaking, he goes out.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
According to Australia’s BBC News report, Indonesian airline spokesman Johannes Sirway said that this decision saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We prepared the helicopter from Balicaphan in Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, this morning before the plane arrived in Palo, we lost him.
He added, “Our heart has failed to hear this news.”
At the same time, the officials are concerned that the death toll will reach thousands of people and the country's natural blast management agency says access is limited to cities in Dongguan, Sigi and Bulgaria.
Sotopo Porovo Nogrohoho, spokesman of the agency, said: “We think the number of deaths will still increase because many funerals are still underneath and much of them cannot be accessed.”
The waves of their height to six meters have transformed Palo Telly from the ground and will take place in the city on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft also provide assistance and goods.
Resa Kosoma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “Every minute of ambulance comes here full of funeral.”
Healthy water is low.
“Everyone is stealing small shops.”
John Gulfwand of the World Red Cross in Indonesia told CNN: “The Red Cross is trying to help the remainder, but we don’t know what they will face there.
This is a sad thing, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I want you all to work night and day to do good things about extermination.
Are you ready for this?” reports CNN.
Earlier this year, a earthquake occurred in the Indonesian Lamboc, where John captured more than 550 people.
Micronesia: New Guinea’s airline now says the plane has lost a man in the lake after falling.
The airline that dropped in a lake in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia after its previous statements based on the safety of all 47 passengers and crew in the airline, says a man missing.
New Guinea’s airline reported on Saturday afternoon that one of the passengers dies missing the flight.
The airline said it was working with local officials, hospitals, and officers to find this man.
The airline has not responded immediately to questions regarding the exact information of the passenger like his age and nationality.
Airplane has dropped into water after an emergency landing attempt from the Chuk airport band, and local ships have helped save passengers and crew.
On Friday, the officials said seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers of the airplane were installed in the hospital on Saturday and the status of all of them was stable.
The cause of the fall and precise arrangement of events has not yet been identified.
The U.S. airline and the U.S. Navy have both stated that the aircraft has fallen in the lake due to the shortage of the band.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had gone out of the band.
Bill Jens, an American passenger said the height of the plane was very low when it landing.
Jeans said, “It was a good thing.”
Janes said he and others were able to ride in the airplane and in the blue that reached their necklace with anguish and bring themselves to an emergency exit.
He said he was afraid of the guests, and he was struggling, and he himself was taken out of the area of a small injury.
The U.S. Navy also said assaults near the plane working on repairing the school were deployed by a boat to save people and drove people to the beach before the plane was about 30 meters (100 feet) in the waters of the river.
Information from the aviation security network shows that 111 people have died in the falls of the new-genuine Papouasian aircraft, but this was not included in the new-genuine aviation company.
The analyst presented the nighttime table where a woman was burnt live.
A man who was accused of burning a woman from the CCIP live on Saturday was ended in 2014.
Paul Roulette, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as a witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the fair board how he used telephone reports to put the 29-year-old Quinton Teles and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers alongside the crash at night.
According to a report by Claire Leager, Roulette said she got the location information from several mobile phones that shows that Teles was with him in the night of Chemberg's death, which was astonished by the previous allegation.
When the information showed that his phone was claimed to have been with his friend Michelle, Chemibers, the police went to investigate Sydney.
Sanford stood on Saturday and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked him whether this claim of Teles is true that it was in the Sanford car that night, he said, "Drug says because my car was in the night."
Another contradiction was that Teles said he had been acquainted with him for about two weeks when he died.
Telephone reports have shown that at the time it was only a week of their knowledge.
Roulette said after Chemberg's death, Television had removed the Chemberg's calls, telecommunications and information from her phone.
Hill said, "Teles has removed him from his life."
The final court meeting will be held on Sunday.
The judge stated that his judgment was expected to be sent to the court on the same day.
What is the conscious hip-hop?
A three-person group of hip-hop music wants to challenge this kind of music by filling their music with positive messages.
The Berry Groups, from Bristol, claim that Hip Hop has taken away from its principle that it has been expressing political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to return this style of music to their own principle and make the love of Hip Hop conscious again.
Artists from music groups such as Fujiz and Camin have seen that artists like Akila and Lucky have recently revived music in England.
Again another black skin?
New York’s nurse complained of her marriage because they sent her to her after sending her a message of the "news."
A New York nurse complained of a couple who had dismissed her for racist issues because she received a wrong message from the mother of the family that she was also complaining that the nurse was another black skin.
These couples deny that they are racists, and resemble the complaint as an accusation.
When the nurse went home for her first day of work in 2016, Lancey Plasco, the mother of two children, realized that the new nurse of the children, Giselle Morris, was black and felt worried.
Mrs. Plasco – Flaxman wrote in a message to her wife, “I don’t want another black skin again.”
However, instead of sending this message to her wife, she sent it twice to Mrs. Morris.
After finding her mistake, Ms. Plasco Flaxman expelled Ms. Mores from the "milk" and said she had done a bad job for those who were African-American nurse while her posting report was waiting for Philippine nurse.
The cost of a day of work was paid to Mrs. Morris and then sent her home with an online taxi.
Now, Morris has complained of the couple to give him the loss of the release, and the claim to pay the loss was $ 350 per day for six months and was hired without a contract to be clear for a period of time at work.
He said on Friday to the New York Post newspaper, “I want to show them that they don’t do such things, and that I know it’s a distinction.”
This couple has responded badly to the claims that they are racists, while they say that his release was a reasonable job because they think that after the insult would no longer be relied on him.
“My wife has sent a message to her and has no meaning.
He is not a racist.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the New York Post newspaper, “We are not racists.”
"But do you give your child to someone you have wronged him, even if you have wronged him?"
Your newborn child?
I don't think.”
Plasco, similarly with the complaint, said that his wife had a two-month leave for the birth of their child and was "in a difficult situation."
He added: “Do you want to be someone like him?
His choice is not good.”
While the complaint is still in stream, public thoughts have quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Pendington publishers are worried about the lack of communication between readers and speakers.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Band, who was born shortly after the acceptance of the book, said: “Before the book is printed, it is difficult to leave yourself a place to read the book for the first time.
Knowing what we know about the great success of Peddington today is very interesting."
He said, before his father inspired a small toy bear to write to the children, he was a BBC filmmaker, and he added that the sixth anniversary of his father’s death was “small and milk.”
He described Peddington as “a very important member of our family” and added that his father was totally proud of his ultimate success.
He said, “My father was quite calm, and his people were not selfish.”
“But because Peddington was very real to him, as if you had a child who could get something: you’re proud of him although you didn’t actually do that.
I think he's seeing your success like this.
Although he created Peddington and was his nephew, he always had the success of Peddington.”
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye to her behind the phone.
After her daughter’s fall, she was quickly transferred to Louis Pastor 2 hospital, but doctors tried to save her.
Mrs. Ednan – Laperoz said, “I’m not calling you regularly to tell you if my daughter is really bad, and she doesn’t think she’s going to stay.”
“Then he called me to tell him he’ll leave the world in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, sweetheart."
I'll join you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart alive were little ineffective and left his body.
She was dead a few moments ago, and all her body members were working.
I just had to sit there and wait and all this happened to me.
Because I was among other families and people, I couldn't wander, cry, or cry.
I really had to keep myself calm.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, who was now a sugar to lose her daughter, went on board the plane along with other passengers, while forgotten the suffering she had experienced.
He said, “No one knew.”
“I had fallen down my head and still shaved tears.”
This is a tough explanation, but in the plane there was a feeling of compassion with my whole existence.
The fact that Nead needed my love and I had to understand it.
I didn't know how much he loved him.
Dear women by installing cards on the bridge trying to prevent suicide of others.
Two women who have lost their loved ones are trying to prevent others from suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hammers are using cards on the bridge of Wales that contain inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can contact to ask for help.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13, who found depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
He said, “I don’t want families to experience the feelings I have every day.”
A 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydia, said that her son had a beautiful smile in the future.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They always said that the smile would shine every house.
Nevertheless, she left her job before she died, because "the place of her job was really dark."
In 2014, Tiler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his dead body.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am always worried that this event will have a bad effect on him."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, “Tell people that there is someone who can ask for help or talk to her, even if she is a friend.
“Don’t be silent – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Hamferiz, who has been friends with Mrs. Dois for years, has lost Mark, who has been in contact with her for 15 years.
He said, “Mark didn’t say that he had a feeling of sadness or depression or something like that.”
“As a day before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
“Christmas was so depressed that when children opened their gifts, they didn’t look at them or anything.”
He said that Mark’s death was a very heavy strike for them, but they had to take a look at this: “This happens to the family as a whole.
The grief kills us.
But we all have to live and fight hard.”

The future of Bret-Kawana with the start of FBI research
On Saturday, Mr. Felix said, “I thought, if we could really do what he wants to do – that is, research in a limited time, with a limited extent – we might have been able to get a little lonely,” and he added, fearing that Ben Beast would be gone without the party, the committee “beat out.”
Why did Mr. Kavana and the Republicans not want the FBI to start the investigation?
It's their time for the time.
Until the sixth period of November elections remain only five weeks, if, as expected, a republic will act badly, their efforts to find a man who wants to be chosen for a great idiot will be extremely weakened.
George Dableo. Bush took the phone to contact the senators and lobbyed with them to support Mr. Kavanai, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was then Ashley the personal man of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI reports?
The Senate will vote, and 51 chairs are now in the power of Republicans and 49 chairs are also in the presence of Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kawaana can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Mike Pence, Vice President, can also vote and declare him the great Duvan.
"Khash" number of North Korean fleets under Kim's government
A South Korean lawyer has said that since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago, the number of North Korean fleets to South Korea has decreased.
The South Korean ministry said that we had 1,127 cases of asylum last year, which had decreased compared to 2,706 cases of asylum in 2011.
Mr. Park said more severe control of North Korea and China borders and higher salary of Chian Adam, including influential factors in this.
Pyongyang has not expressed any public opinion.
Most refugees from North Korea are finally given as South Korean citizenship.
After the end of the two Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people flee China's borders because China has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to pass from a strongly protected region between two Koreas.
China knows that refugees are not illegal immigrants and often return them to their country.
Relations between the two North and South Korea, which are still known as the war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
In the early days of this month, two countries’ leaders met in Pyongyang and talked about nuclear-weapon negotiations that had stopped.
This occurred after a historic meeting between Donald Trump, President of the United States and Kim Jong - he was in Singapore after the whole agreement of the parties on the nuclear weapon of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Rei Yang-Ho, had known the U.S. sanctions as a factor of lack of progress in nuclear negotiations since then.
Mr. Ree said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, “If we cannot trust the United States, I can’t be sure of our national security, and under such circumstances, in no way a forward side, and we’re not breaking our own weapons.”
Nancy Plussie says Bert Cavana is “hysteria” and is inappropriate for the state of the great fool.
Nancy Plussie, the head of the House of Representatives' Minority, the nominee of the High Duncan, called Bert Kawana "Hystery" and said he was not suitable in terms of behavior to serve in the Great Duncan.
On Saturday, Plusi expressed criticism in an interview at the Tribon Texas Festival in Austin, Texas.
Plussy said on Thursday about her response to the Covenant in the Senate Judgment Committee, "I couldn't tell it, I think if the lady did this, they would call her "hystery."
In a sense, Cowana rejected accusations of sexual abuse when Christian Blasi Ford and her two teenagers.
Kavanah was emotional at the beginning of her speech, and when she talked about her family and years of high school, she sometimes shouted and cried.
He has also clearly convicted the Democrats in the committee and accused him of “a funny and coordinated personality terror” that the liberals have organized it because of the failure of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Plussius said, the witness of the Kawaana has proved that he cannot serve in a great divine, because he has proved that he is anti-Democracy.
“I think that with her talks, the Kawaana has shown that it is not eligible for this job and how she speaks about Clinton and Democrats, she has shown her inability.”
When Plussy was asked if the election of Kawaana, and if the Democrats would have a majority of parliamentary representatives again, he would try to accuse him of crime or not, his response was negative.
"I say this," he said, "if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not suitable for a great devil, nor for a court that is currently working there."
Kawaana is now judged in the Washington Court of Justice's re-examination court.
He added that as a Democrat he is worried about potential opposition votes issued by Canada against the law on safeguarding medical care, or against the law against Vide (forbidden to defeat), as he is considered a protective judge.
In the confirmed meetings, the Kuwaiti Republicans took the right to answer questions on whether or not they would return some of the great devil’s decisions.
"It's not time for a Hysterical person to go to court and expect us to say "what's interesting."
Women have to manage their tears.
This is a criticism of grief, and months and years are deprived of anger, and he can't get rid of it without crying.
45 years later, Mrs. Ashtain said to me, “When we get nervous we cry.”
“I don’t think it’s unusual, isn’t it?”
He continued: “The man who was a manager helped me very much, and he told me he was crying when he became nervous, but he created the technique, as if he was crying when he was nervous, and he was crying, and he said to the person he was talking to him, ‘I am crying for anxiety.’”
I'm angry."
And then it continued to do it.
And I thought this technique was very good.”
Tears are somewhat angry to get out because tears are basically misinterpreted.
One of my most obvious memories of my first job in the office where the most of his employees were, was that when I cried because of anger inexplicable, Mrs. Senior took my neck after me – a letter manager I was always a little afraid of her – and threw me down the stairs.
And he said to me, "Let Hergs not let them see you cry."
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they're jealous of you."
Patricia Shruder, who was then a Democratic member of the U.S. Congress from Clerwood, worked with Gary Hart at the time of his presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Mrs. Hart was seen on a boat with a foreigner named Mannky Bizin and abandoned competition in the elections, Mrs. Sherwooder, who had been severely dismissed, realized that he had no reason to be nominated as president.
30 years later, he laughed at me, "It wasn't the decision to think well about it."
“There were seven other candidates in the presidential competition and my candidate was the last thing they wanted.
One of them was called “Snow ship and seven shorts.”
Because it was too late to form the campaign, and it had no time to collect budget, so he swore to take up to $2 million budget not to compete.
It was the battle of Shakespeare.
He realized that some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 to men are only $250.
She was amazed and thought, “Do you think I’m going to take a discount?”
When he began his speech and announced that the official campaign was not beginning, he was so affected by the emotions – by the people who supported him, he appreciated the system that had made it difficult to collect money and couldn’t be treated to find voters instead of the representatives. This was because of the sexual discrimination.
Sherwood reminds me how the media reacted to her, "Adam, we have a nervous disturbance."
“You thought Clinx was my financial supporter.”
I remember what they wanted to write on my tomb?
“He cried?”
The U.S. and China's trade war can be beneficial.
Experts say that the balls of the start of the trade war between the U.S. and China were craftsman, and while the battle remains very late, the difference between the two countries could have a long-term effect in Beijing.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump warned China's first export taxes such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Trade tensions between the two countries this week with new identifications on $200 billion (€150 billion) of goods, i.e. half of the total imports from China to the US.
Beijing has made a difference each time, which has been identified by five to ten percent by US $60 billion from its last example.
China has sworn to compete step by step with the United States and is far from the world's second-largest economy as soon as possible with these winds.
The return of Washington’s decision is to give up against his demands, but for China’s president, Shi Jinping, is very embarrassed to publicly honor the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play correctly with its cards, pressures from the U.S. trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two countries.
Abigel Grays, a research member working in the U.S. Center’s New Security Thinking Room on Asian issues, said: “This fact that a political decision without thinking could cause Washington or Beijing to create a situation that causes economic fall in any country is much more dangerous than anything before.”
Syria’s Foreign Minister says Syria’s “Hope” to return asylum seekers
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help from other countries to restore the war that has destroyed it for more than seven years.
When the teacher William, Syrian Foreign Minister, talked to the United Nations General Assembly, he said his country’s conditions would improve.
"Today, thanks to progress made in combating terrorism, the situation of Syria has become more stable and secure," he said.
The government is trying to rebuild areas that terrorists have destroyed and restore normal life to the country.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country are ready to leave it because of terrorism and the economic actions that had impacted their daily life and their economy.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the war in 2011.
Six million other people who still live in this country need humanitarian assistance.
“The Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the country,” he said.
But he stressed that the conditional aid, as well as the aid of countries that finance Syria from the Syrians.
Europe has secured the defeat of Ryder Cape in Paris
The European team won the US team and won the final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 could win at Rider Cape 2018 in the national golf course outside Paris, in France.
The U.S. has now been defeated six times in Europe, and has not been able to win in Europe in Rider Cape since 1993.
When Danish Captain Thomas Burn scored 14.5 that needed to defeat the United States, Europe resumed its championship.
Phil Michaelson, the American star, who tried most of the time of the race, threw in the thirteenth hole hit with his hit, and accepted his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
Molinary, Italian Open Golf, has been played in all stages of the game, and one of four players who have played 0-0-5 since the current form of the race began in 1979.
The low-range European team player, turbon Sun, removed the 5&4 American open golf from Denmark.
Justin Johnson, the world-range top player, won the 2nd and 1th score against Ann Pauler, who played his last Knight Cape in England.
Sergio García, the Eight-Rayder Cape, has always won the most in the European competitions with 25.5 points in its ranking.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t stop crying.
It was a hard year.
Thank you very much for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we got the cap back.
After Europe’s victory, Garcia said, “It’s a team issue, and I’m happy that I could help.”
He spoke to his own hometown John Ram the opportunity, who was able to defeat Tiger Woods in single games on Sunday with scores 2 and 1.
The 23-year-old said, “For the defeat of Tiger Woods, I feel very proud, I grew up watching this man’s game.”
Woods defeated every four of his race in France and now has professional statistics 13-21-3 for Richard Cape record.
This statistic is strange for anyone who has always been the best players and has earned the original title after Jack Nicholas 14.
The U.S. team has tried all weekends to find places from the short run on the ground of the race where Patrick Red, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fino are not there because these players played all over the race with all their talents and abilities.
Captain James Forrick, U.S. captain, after his team’s desperate performance, said, “I am proud of these players, they fought.”
This morning, sometimes, we pushed the European team.
We've ruined.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All the 12 players played very well.
We'll get together again and I'll work with the U.S. Professional Golf Association and the Rider Cape Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to be Captain.
You have to admire them.
They played better than us.
